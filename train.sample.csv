"Alpaca eyes are protuberant and susceptible to trauma. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] With the increase in population of alpacas in the UK, these animals are being more frequently presented to veterinarians for assessment and treatment. The diagnosis of clinical disease relies on a sound understanding of typical appearance and normal parameters, as well as their variations. All published details of measurement of ocular parameters and variations in clinically healthy alpacas are from the USA, Canada and Italy. It is important to validate whether these findings are consistent in the alpaca population in the UK. Developmental and heritable eye disease has been reported in alpacas. 6 7 Importantly, some developmental variations in young animals, such as persistent hyaloid artery and Bergmeister's papillae, appear to be of no clinical significance. 4 A relationship between coat colour, iris colour and fundus pigmentation has been suggested. 8 There is also a suggestion (but not yet proven) that coat or iris colour is related to congenital deafness, with less pigmented individuals more likely to have congenital deafness. 9 Incidental detection of abnormalities on ophthalmoscopic examination is commonly reported, with some abnormalities likely a result of previous trauma, including superficial corneal scars, anterior and posterior synechiae, iris to iris persistent pupillary membranes, cataracts, subluxated lenses, and vitreous opacities. 8 9 Schirmer tear test The Schirmer tear test without local anaesthetic application (STT-1) is used to test tear production. In alpacas there are reported mean±sd values of 20.88±4.04 mm/minute (range 15.50-30.50) 10 and 16.9±4.1 mm/minute (range 12-23). 11@story_separate@Intraocular pressure (IOP) is useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma, uveitis and trauma. Mean results from several studies on applanation tonometry range from 12.51 mmHg to 19 mmHg. 9 11-14 Rebound tonometry of one population showed a mean result of 14.21 mmHg. 12 Time of day is reported not to have a significant effect on IOP. 13 Nasolacrimal duct patency Nasolacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. 15 16 However the authors are not aware of any publication on using fluorescein dye to check for nasolacrimal duct patency (Jones test) in alpacas and the normal time for dye to appear at the nostril. Fifty-one alpacas of both sexes and fleece phenotypes, and of various ages, were recruited from three farms in East Anglia between July and September 2010. All were presented as healthy by the owners and considered clinically normal following brief physical examination by the authors. Farm, age, sex, fleece phenotype and fleece colour were recorded for each animal. A range of examinations were performed for each alpaca depending on equipment available on the day and the tolerance of the alpaca to examination. Both eyes were assessed in all tests unless the animal became stressed by the procedure. Alpacas used in the 24-hour IOP study were housed and monitored in pens at the Queen's Veterinary School Hospital Farm Animal Unit. All other examinations were performed in the alpacas' home environment, in the corner of a barn during the afternoon. They were allowed to lower into sternal recumbency (a cushed position) if preferred, but the majority tolerated examination standing with loose manual restraint by neck or bracelet hold, with care taken to avoid compression of the jugular vein. The alpacas were accustomed to being handled and chemical restraint was not used. Thirty-five alpacas were examined with both direct ophthalmoscopy (Keeler Practitioner, Keeler, Windsor, UK) and with slit lamp biomicroscopy (Hawk Eye Portable Slit Lamp, Dioptrix, Toulouse, France). A drape was placed over the head of the alpaca and the veterinarian as necessary to achieve dilation of the pupil sufficient for examination of the lens and fundus without chemical mydriasis. Appearance and variation of the structures of the eye were recorded. Tear production was measured in 40 alpacas using Schirmer tear test strips (Schering-Plough Animal Health) without prior application of local anaesthetic (STT-1). The 35-mm strips were placed in the lower lateral conjunctival fornix for 60 seconds with the eye gently held closed. Measurements were read immediately at 60 seconds and recorded as mm/minute. A 2 x 2 cross-over study (n=4) was initially performed to establish whether there was a significant difference in the results between using the upper and lower lids. IOP was estimated from the central cornea in 46 alpacas using the TonoVet rebound tonometer (Icare VET Finland Oy, Vantaa, Finland). The tonometer was set to the 'horse' manufacturer setting as has been done in another study. 12 Six measurements were acquired from each eye to obtain the final reading as the average of four measurements, excluding the highest and lowest result. A pilot study was performed on eight alpacas in a 4 x 4 cross-over study to establish whether two different holding techniques affected IOP measured on the rebound tonometer. In a subset of 25 alpacas in this group, the Tono-Pen XL applanation tonometer (Reichert Technologies, Depew, New York, USA) was also used following the TonoVet. Two to three drops of topical local anaesthetic (Minims Tetracaine Hydrochloride 1.0% w/v, Bausch & Lomb UK) were applied to the cornea about three minutes before the Tono-Pen was used. The mean of four valid applanation readings was recorded for each alpaca. Eight female yearling alpacas were used for 24-hour IOP monitoring. After an overnight acclimatisation period, rebound tonometry was performed bilaterally every three hours, from 09.00 to 06.00 the following day. The use of fluorescein dye to assess nasolacrimal duct patency was assessed unilaterally in four yearling females and bilaterally in four adult males. A fluorescein sodium ophthalmic strip (Fluorets, Chauvin Pharmaceuticals) was dipped in saline solution and stroked across the lower bulbar conjunctiva. Blinking allowed the dye to spread throughout the eye. Alpacas were assessed initially up to 39 minutes after dye application, then again one hour later, for the presence of dye at the nostrils. Data analysis was performed with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office V.15.0.5101.1002, Redmond, Washington, USA). Results are presented as mean±sd (range). Statistical significance of the differences related to instrument, technique, laterality or sex was determined using a two-tailed Student's paired t test. Probability values of P≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. For analysis of associations with age, alpacas were grouped into juveniles (<30 days old), yearlings (11-15 months), and adult group 1 (2-8 years old) and group 2 (≥8 years old), and single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine statistical significance of differences between groups. ANOVA was also used for analysis of diurnal variation in IOP. Eighteen males and 33 females were included in the study. Fleece phenotype consisted of 46 Huacaya and six Suri. Age groups included juveniles (n=9; 9-26 days old), yearlings (n=11; 11-15 months old) and adults (n=31; 2-16.9 years old). The signalment and range of examinations performed for each alpaca are presented in table 1. Seventy eyes of 35 alpacas (eight males, 27 females) were examined. Twenty-five alpacas had a white fleece, with brown (n=3), grey (n=21) and blue (n=1) irides. Six alpacas had a brown fleece, all with brown irides. Four alpacas were fawn with brown (n=1) and grey (n=3) irides. The majority of alpacas (n=33) had slate grey/brown fundi. Pink/non-pigmented regions in the fundus were seen in a 1.2-year-old white alpaca with blue irides and a one-year-old white alpaca with grey irides. Coloration and pigmentation findings are presented in table 2. Lens opacity prevalence was 37.5 per cent (n=3/8) in young adults (two to eight years old), with all affected alpacas at least four years old. There was a 62.5 per cent prevalence (n=5/8) of lens opacities in alpacas over the age of eight years. Easily discernible lens changes included nuclear sclerosis (n=1) and immature cataract (n=6). Of these seven alpacas, three had concurrent subtle multifocal opacities visible in the lens: dots (n=2) and lines (n=1). One alpaca displayed subtle multifocal opaque dots without other changes. In the posterior chamber, juvenile alpacas had a 33.3 per cent prevalence (n=3/9) of persistent hyaloid arteries, all present bilaterally. The prevalence in yearling alpacas was 40 per cent (n=4/10), two bilaterally and two unilaterally. No persistent hyaloid arteries were detected in any adult alpacas. Comparison of lens and posterior chamber variations and abnormalities within age groups is presented in table 3. In an initial 2 x 2 cross-over pilot study (n=4), there was no significant difference in the results between using the upper and lower lids (P=0.10). Placement into the lower lid was chosen as the easier method for the operator. Forty alpacas (13 males, 27 females) underwent STT-1. Data from 74 out of 80 eyes were collected as there was poor tolerance to the procedure in the second eye in two alpacas, and in four eyes the strip did not remain in the eye for the whole 60 seconds. In two eyes, the tears reached the end of the 35-mm strip shortly before 60 seconds, and during analysis of the results these measurements were entered as 40 mm/minute. The mean STT-1 was 20.0±6.0 mm/minute (range 10-40). There was no significant difference between sexes (P=0.23) or age groups (ANOVA: F=1.21, Fcrit=2.74, F<Fcrit). There was a statistically significant difference between the left and right eyes (P=0.04). The mean for the left was 21.5±6.3 mm/minute oculus sinister (OS), and for the right 18.6±5.5 mm/minute oculus dextrus (OD). There was no significant difference in IOP measured on the rebound tonometer between the neck hold and the bracelet hold (P=0.896) in the 4 x 4 cross-over study, and therefore either hold was used in the main study according to handler preference. IOP was estimated with rebound tonometry in the 92 eyes of 46 alpacas (13 males, 33 females). The mean IOP was 17.2±5.5 mmHg (range 5-38). There were no significant differences between the left and right eyes (P=0.32), male and female (P=0.31), or age (ANOVA: F=2.23, Fcrit=2.71, F<Fcrit). The subgroup that had both rebound and applanation tonometry performed consisted of 25 alpacas (seven males, 18 females). In 50 eyes there was no significant difference between the two measuring methods (P=0.30). The mean IOP with rebound tonometry was 16.4±5.3 mmHg (range 5-29). The mean IOP with applanation tonometry was 17.6±5.7 mmHg (range 8-36). The results for the circadian rhythm for IOP are shown in figure 1 . There was a significant difference between the means at each time point (ANOVA: Fcrit=2.09, F=2.69, F>Fcrit). No fluorescein dye appeared at the nostrils for any of the eight alpacas tested. All procedures were well tolerated by the majority of alpacas, with the only objection seen by two alpacas to the STT-1. The TonoVet was found to be quicker to use than the Tono-Pen as it was tolerated better by the alpacas, and had the added advantage of not requiring topical local anaesthesia. There were no reactions to the solutions administered to the eye and no damage to the eye was observed as a result of the procedures. Manual restraint using one handler was sufficient and the use of penned areas in the barns was acceptable for all procedures. The proposed association between coat colour, iris and fundus colour 8 is supported to some degree within this population. The only blue-eyed white alpaca examined had non-pigmented regions in the fundus, as did one white alpaca with grey irides. The remainder of the alpacas had grey/brown pigmented fundi, whether they were white, fawn or brown fleeced alpacas with grey or brown irides. If coat or iris colour is genetically related to congenital deafness, then ophthalmoscopy may be a useful initial screening tool; however, this association still needs to be determined. 9 None of the alpacas in the study was reported to display signs of deafness; however, this may be difficult to pick up in alpacas in a herd situation. The oldest alpaca with persistent hyaloid arteries in this study was 13 months old. Given the fairly high prevalence (36.8 per cent; n=7/19) in young alpacas, persistent hyaloid arteries appear to be a normal developmental variation. It is unknown whether there are any consequences (positive or negative) of the delayed closure of patency; however, it is useful to be aware of their possible presence during examination or where cataract surgery is to be attempted. 17 No hereditary lens abnormalities such as juvenile cataract were seen in young alpacas. About half the mature animals showed lens changes, including nuclear sclerosis, cataract and other opacities. It is possible that some of the more subtle dot and line opacities in the posterior pole of the lens at the site of Mittendorf dot may have resulted from persistent hyaloid vasculature. 18 Schirmer tear test STT-1 is used to test tear production, and values are altered in keratoconjunctivitis sicca and surface tear film disorders. The mean STT-1 value of 20.0±6.0 mm/ minute agrees well with the previously published value of 20.88±4.04 mm/minute, 10 while slightly less well with another published value of 16.9±4.1 mm/minute. 11 The range of values obtained here (10-40 mm/minute) and the sd are wider than in other publications (ranges 15.5-30.5 mm/minute 10 and 12-23 mm/minute 11 ). The eyelids were held closed gently in this study to ensure strip retention, and this may have elevated some values. Regarding technique, the small cross-over study performed showed no significant difference between using the upper and lower eyelids for placement of the STT strip. Both upper 10 and lower 11 conjunctival fornices have been used in previous studies, and it has been determined that tear strip position for STT-1 in horses is insignificant. 19 No difference in STT value was found between age groups. This is consistent with one study 11 but differs from another, 10 whose authors found STT-1 to increase by 3.45 mm/minute for every 10-year increase in age. The reason for the statistically significant difference (P=0.015) in means between left and right eye STT remains unexplained; however, the difference in values are not considered clinically important. The order in which eyes were examined was not controlled or formally randomised, so there may have been some bias in order, affecting the results between the left and right eyes. The contralateral (second) eye may have been stimulated to also increase tear production while the first eye underwent the STT-1, resulting in a higher value when the second eye underwent the STT-1. The authors are cautious of over-reporting this finding (in case of a type I error). IOP is useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma, uveitis and trauma. A comparison of IOP results with previously published values is shown in table 4. Means from this study for both applanation and rebound tonometry are generally higher than others' findings, with a wider sd and range. No significant sex-related or age-related change in IOP was found, in agreement with most other studies but in discrepancy with one. 14 Factors which could possibly cause discrepancies between the studies may include population differences in corneal thickness and curvature, 20 21 instrument technique and calibration, undetected pathology, stress, different pressure on vasculature in the neck, and choice of topical local anaesthetics. 22 No statistically significant difference was found between measurements obtained by rebound and applanation tonometry, in contrast to one previous study 12 in which IOP was significantly higher (P=0.002) for rebound tonometry compared with applanation tonometer; however, the authors concluded that the difference (1.70 mmHg) was not clinically significant. The 24-hour IOP data showed a significant difference between the means at each time and indications of a circadian trend with a sine-like distribution with time. Higher values were obtained during the daytime (from 09.00 to 21.00) and lower measurements during the dark night-time period and early morning (from 12.00 to 06.00). IOP circadian rhythms have been recorded in rabbits, 23 cats, 24 dogs 25 and horses, 26 and so it is feasible for alpacas to have the same. One previous study found that the time of measurement had no significant effect on IOP in camelids, however it did not perform any measurements between 19.00 and 07.00. 13 The reported IOP was lower at 19.00 but not significantly so. The findings of the present study suggest that the fluorescein dye Jones test for nasolacrimal duct patency may not be of clinical use in alpacas as none of the subjects displayed fluorescein stain at the nostrils within one to two hours. Although the alpacas in this study were not further clinically evaluated for nasolacrimal patency, it is unlikely that all alpacas in the tested group would be affected by a congenital or mechanical obstruction as they displayed no clinical signs. The use of the Jones test should be further investigated in alpacas, with monitoring continued over time periods longer than the one to two hours in this study and with further examination of the anatomy of the nasolacrimal duct. The study used convenience sampling, recruiting three farms in the same region of the UK within easy travelling distance. Not all procedures were performed on all alpacas, so the order in which procedures were performed was not consistent. Examinations were performed by one of two veterinarians and a veterinary student following a brief training period; therefore, expertise level was variable and consistency in technique may have varied.@story_separate@The findings of this study should be taken into account alongside previous publications when examining and assessing alpaca eyes as measurements and observations may influence prepurchase examination conclusions, clinical monitoring of disease and decision-making. The findings appear consistent with previously published values, but there are some variations identified, including the range of measurements obtained and evidence of diurnal circadian rhythm in IOP. From a practical point, the cross-over studies suggest that there is no difference between lower or upper eyelid for STT-1 or between neck hold or bracelet hold for restraint for IOP measurements. The Jones test did not appear to be a valid test for nasolacrimal duct patency in alpacas; however, this should be further investigated.","BACKGROUND: Alpacas are being more frequently presented to veterinarians in the UK. It is important to validate whether published normal ocular parameters are consistent with the alpaca population in the UK. METHODS: Ophthalmic examinations were performed on healthy alpacas (Vicugna pacos) from three farms in East Anglia, UK. RESULTS: On direct ophthalmoscopy of 35 alpacas, there was a 50 per cent prevalence of opacities within the lens in alpacas older than two years old (n=8/16). There was a 36.8 per cent prevalence of persistent hyaloid arteries in alpacas under two years old (n=7/19). The mean Schirmer tear test-1 value was 20.0 ±6 mm/minute (n=40). The mean intraocular pressure measured by rebound tonometry was 17.2 ±5.5 mmHg (n=46), and applanation tonometry resulted in statistically similar values (P=0.30; n=25). There was a significant variation in intraocular pressure throughout a 24-hour period (n=8). Fluorescein dye was not detected at the nostrils of any of the alpacas which underwent a Jones test to assess nasolacrimal duct patency (n=8). CONCLUSION: The ophthalmic findings appear largely consistent with previously published values from North America and continental Europe. Variations include the large range of measurements obtained and evidence of diurnal variation in intraocular pressure."
"Optimal training is crucial for animal welfare in order to produce exercise adaptation but also to maintain good health in a horse. The analysis of change in routine blood parameters is used for the evaluation of training progress, as well as general health, but does not provide the information necessary for estimating subclinical disorders that may worsen with effort and result in interruption of trainings or even termination of sport career. Therefore, additional parameters, such as serum amyloid A (SAA), have been considered. The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate the changes in SAA concentration in Arabian endurance horses during their first training season, with special regard to the relationship between SAA concentration and the time and type of effort (training versus competition). Our study indicates that, in the horses, the measurements of SAA concentration together with commonly accepted parameters give additional insight into health control of the horse. Endurance riding is an equestrian sport, involving completing the distances from 40 km to 160 km, depending on the age and sport level of horses, confirmed by previous finishing competitions required by the regulations. All distances are divided into loops, 20 km to 40 km each, with a time check and obligatory veterinary inspection (vet gate), in order to detect if the horses are fit to continue the ride. Horses with irregular gait or metabolic abnormalities are eliminated from competitions. Horses can reach the highest sport level (160 km competitions) after several years of training and competing at shorter distances since the career of endurance horses spans many years. Not only the time of finishing the ride, but mostly points granted on the veterinary health check, matter for the final score. Therefore, careful regular evaluation of health condition of endurance horses is crucial. While during the competition it is based solely on physical examination performed by a veterinarian, during training it is supported by periodical monitoring of blood parameters. In endurance horses, creatine phosphokinase activity (CPK) poses the most important functional measurement and, additionally, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin concentration (HGB), red blood cell count (RBC), and concentration of total serum protein (TSP), glucose, phosphorus, and potassium [1, 2] are commonly determined. The analysis of change in these parameters over time provides information on metabolic alterations associated with training progress, however, it does not allow to detect developing disorders at the subclinical stage [3] . Therefore, additional parameters characterizing the acute phase response (APR) have been considered [4] [5] [6] . Typical APR that occurs in inflammation involves marked increases in the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins (APPs), such as SAA, which is the major APP in horses [7] [8] [9] , C-reactive protein, and haptoglobin. A similar reaction has been described in humans [10, 11] and animals [12, 13] after strenuous endurance events, however, certain differences between disease-induced and exercise-induced APR exist. In horses, the latter is characterized only by the increases in the concentrations of some cytokines [14] and SAA, with other APPs remaining unchanged [12] . Such reactions may also occur during training [15] , but its role is yet to be clarified. Therefore, the aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate the changes in SAA concentration in Arabian endurance horses during their first training season, with special regard to the relationship between SAA concentration and the time and type of effort (training versus competition).@story_separate@Eight privately-owned, healthy, 6-7 years old, previously untrained Arabian horses (two mares and six geldings) that were starting their endurance training and sport carrier were enrolled in this study. The horses were housed in two stables in similar conditions, fed, and trained according to similar protocols. All exercises were provided under similar terrain conditions. The training involved daily sessions with the exercise-load depending on the horse's condition and increasing with time; altogether the horses covered about 250 km per month, and the sessions with high exercise-load were performed every 14-20 days. Beginning with third month of training, the horses were introduced to endurance competitions at limited distance. The animals were monitored for the whole training season (the first training season in their carrier) and examined before and after training sessions selected for the study-the ones with high exercise-load (25-28 km, speed 14-15 km/h) and before and after finishing the competitions (42-45 km, speed 14-16 km/h). Standard clinical examination performed before and after each training session included in the study revealed no clinical symptoms of disease. The study covered seven months and included five training sessions and three competitions, so the maximal number of examinations for individual horse was eight; however, horses entered a different number of competitions. Blood samples were collected before and within one h after the training sessions or competitions during seven months of training. All samples were obtained during standard veterinary diagnostic procedures; thus, according Polish law, the approval by Local Commission for Ethics in Animal Experiments was not required. All blood samples were acquired by a jugular venipuncture using a BD Vacutainer system into K2-EDTA tubes for hematological tests and plain tubes for serum analyses. EDTA blood samples were kept at + 4 • C and examined within 5 h for hematological parameters: white blood cell (WBC) count, PCV, hemoglobin concentration, and RBC in an automated analyzer calibrated for equine species (ABC Vet, Horiba ABX). The dry tubes were centrifuged (4380× g, 5 min), and serum free from any apparent hemolysis was aspirated for further analyses. AST and CPK activity were determined using automated clinical biochemistry analyzer (Miura One, ISE. S.r.l., Albuccione, Italy). TSP concentration was measured by refractometer technique (Reichert Rhino Vet 360, Munich, Germany). For all measurements, Pointe Scientific (Canton, USA) reagents, standards, calibrators, and controls were used. SAA concentrations were measured using immunoenzymatic commercial assay (PHASE SAA Assay, Tridelta Ltd., Maynooth, Ireland). Sample dilution was 1:1000 instead of 1:2000, recommended by the manufacturer's protocol, and the results were appropriately recalculated. The assay, including the dilution, was previously validated for determination of SAA concentrations in horses [12] . The absorbance was measured by Multiscan Reader (Labsystem, Helsinki, Finland) using a Genesis V 3.00 software program. To avoid the influence of hemoconcentration, SAA concentration was adjusted by TSP, according to the formula: SAA is the SAA concentration, TSP 0 is the TSP level before exertion, and TSP 1 is the total serum protein level after exertion. Numerical variables were presented as the arithmetic mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR), unless normally distributed. The range was reported in all cases. The influence of two different types of effort (training and competition) on blood parameters was assessed using the hierarchical linear model controlling for potential confounding factors: the individual effect of a horse (included since horses were examined a different number of times), the number of efforts the horse had undergone before, and the time of blood collection (before and after the effort). The interaction between the time of blood collection and the type of effort was entered in the last step of developing the model and retained only when significant. Otherwise standardized regression coefficients (β) and p-values for the model without interaction were interpreted. Pairwise comparisons were performed only when a given factor (i.e., number of efforts, time of blood collection, or type of effort) proved significant in the hierarchical model on measurements averaged for an individual horse with respect to these factors, which proved insignificant in the hierarchical model. The paired-sample Student's t-test, or the Wilcoxon signed rank test and sign test in the case of non-normally distributed variables, were used in pairwise comparisons. A significance level (α) was set at 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed in IBM SPSS Statistics 24 (Microsoft, New York, NY, USA) and TIBCO Statistica 13.3.0 (TIBCO Software Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). In all horses hematological and serum biochemical parameters determined before the physical effort fell within relevant reference intervals [2] . During the 7-month training season, TSP was the only blood parameter that significantly increased, while the rest remained unaffected by the number of efforts the horse had undergone ( Table 1) . The significant interaction between type of effort and time of blood collection was observed only for WBC and SAA adj (Table 1 )-they significantly increased after competition, whereas remained unchanged after training (Table 2, Figure 1 ). The highest individual SAA concentrations after competition reached 10.6 mg/L. All remaining hematological (RBC, HGB, PCV) and serum biochemical parameters (CPK, AST, TSP) slightly rose both after training and competition (Table 3) . Table 3 . Other hematological and serum biochemical parameters before and after the effort (training and competition).  This is the first study presenting the changes in blood parameters of endurance horses monitored during 7 months in their first training season. As expected, the parameters routinely measured in the monitoring of endurance training (CPK, AST, RBC, HGB, and PCV) slightly increased likewise after the training and competitions. CPK and AST activities are commonly used in horses as the indicators of any kind of muscle fatigue or damage. After strenuous exercise, they increase from four-to 35-fold and from two-to six-fold, respectively [16] . In muscle damage, they are markedly elevated [16, 17] and clinical sings, such as lameness, occur. Exercise-induced elevations in CPK activity may be attenuated by conditioning [16] but do not provide information on the magnitude of muscle damage [17] . In our study, CPK and AST activities were elevated significantly but only slightly less than two-fold, regardless of the type of effort. RBC, HGB, and PCV values are routinely examined in sport horses. In our study, the differences between resting and post-exercise measurements were similar during training and competition. Exercise-induced hematological changes result from spleen contraction and the decrease in plasma volume [18] . The latter is also likely to account for the post-exercise increase of TSP. Moreover, basal TSP concentration was the only parameter measured in our study that increased along with training process. It has been hypothesized that in human during training, plasma total osmolar and albumin contents increase to maintain constant during plasma volume expansion due to training-induced hypervolemia [19] , which is consistent with our findings in horses. However, although another study observed no increase of TSP concentration after training season, this could be due to the fact that this study was almost two-fold shorter and involved different training regimens for each horse [20] . It has been hypothesized that, in inexperienced horses, physical effort during training, particularly a heavy one, induces a reaction similar to APR [15] . Several theories explaining the causes of exercise-induced APR have been proposed, however, mostly in regard to extreme effort during competitions or overtraining [21] [22] [23] . One of these hypotheses is that a high load of training produces muscle and/or skeletal and/or joint injuries, including microinjuries, which stimulate circulating monocytes and other cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) [14, 22] . Another widely accepted theory is that APR results from glycogen depletion in working muscles, which in turn results in IL-6 release [10, 24] . IL-6 promotes pleiotropic effects, i.e., hepatic glycogenolysis and lipolysis, but also stimulates the production of APPs, including SAA in the liver [5, 7, 9] . Exercise-induced APR in horses has been postulated to result from an acute challenge to muscle metabolism, rather than muscle damage; however, definitive evidence is still lacking [25] . In our study, an increase of SAA concentration (up to 16-fold) was observed after competitions but not during training and never reached high values. Even the highest individual SAA concentrations after competition were still relatively low (max. 10.62 mg/L), compared with those reported in horses with acute inflammation in the course of bacterial or viral infections, where SAA concentration exceeds 100 mg/L [26, 27] . In the case of exercise-induced APR, as described earlier, the highest (10-fold or more) increases in SAA concentration have been reported in endurance horses that completed the longest (120-160 km) distances [12] , whereas after a moderate distance ride or strenuous training in inexperienced horses was slighter but still significant, resulting in an observed two to four-fold elevation of SAA concentration [15] . The unique feature of this response was that SAA levels tended to increase proportionally to the covered distance [28] . Our results imply that training sessions do not trigger the increase in SAA concentration when the workload is optimal to produce adaptation and maintain good health. Moderate increases of SAA after competitions indicated a heavier challenge, particularly when the distance covered two training sessions. However, the increases were not high enough to indicate pathology but, rather, the physiological response to the relatively high workload, given that the horses were in their first training season. Our previous study revealed that, in horses trained for the longest distances, SAA concentrations did not rise after moderate distance, i.e., up to 60 km long rides [12] ; however, when the resting SAA concentration exceeded 1 mg/l, the horse was likely not to complete a long distance (i.e., 120 and 160 km) endurance competition [21] . It has also been suggested that in young, inexperienced endurance horses, SAA concentrations at rest are higher [15] , which is consistent with the findings of our present study. These facts suggest that SAA concentrations at rest may decrease with training due to adaptational muscular remodeling in young animals and then increase only in the response to the heaviest efforts or pathology. Our study indicates that such phenomena do not occur in the first training season, so it probably requires a longer training process. Another parameter that increased significantly only after competition was WBC. Higher WBC values are likely to be a combined result of hemoconcentration and the release of neutrophil marginal and splenic pool triggered by adrenaline, noradrenaline, and cortisol [29] . We enrolled in the study young (6-7 years old), healthy endurance Arabian horses to minimize the influence of potential confounding factors, such as aging and disease [30] , but individual differences among horses still posed limitations of the study. The authors declare no conflict of interest. Total serum protein level after exertion TSP 0 Total serum protein level before exertion TNF-α Tumor necrosis factor α WBC White blood cell count@story_separate@Our study indicates that, in the horses that begin their endurance carrier, the measurements of SAA concentration, together with commonly accepted parameters, give additional insight into the training process. In contrast to routine measurements, which rise in a similar manner regardless of the type of the effort, the increase in SAA concentration only indicated an excessive stress-load after heavy effort, which should not be repeated too often. Thus, in unexperienced horses in the beginning of their carrier, the moderate increases in SAA level indicate heavy effort, while higher increases can alert the veterinarian to the onset of different diseases, even without clear clinical signs.","Sport training leads to adaptation to physical effort that is reflected by the changes in blood parameters. In equine endurance athletes, blood testing is accepted as a support in training, however, only the changes before versus after exercise in creatine phosphokinase activity (CPK) and basic blood parameters are usually measured. This study is the first longitudinal investigation of the changes in routinely measured blood parameters and, additionally, serum amyloid A (SAA), during seven months, in Arabian horses introduced to endurance training and competing in events for young horses. It has been determined that CPK, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count (RBC), and concentration of total serum protein (TSP) slightly increased after training sessions and competitions in similar manner. The increase in white blood cell (WBC) count was higher after competitions and SAA increased only after competitions. Total protein concentration was the only parameter that increased with training during a 7-month program. SAA indicated only in the case of heavy effort, and, it thus may be helpful in the monitoring of training in young horses. In an optimal program, its concentration should not increase after a training session but only after heavy effort, which should not be repeated too often."
"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that has caused the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major health problem worldwide with thousands of mortality cases. On 11 March 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic [1, 2] . Clinical symptoms of this disease are variable, ranging from asymptomatic to hypoxemic respiratory failure and even death. On 19 January 2021, WHO reported more than 4.7 million new cases for the past week, with the total cumulative cases over 93 million and over 2 million deaths worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic [3] . Physiological and immune system changes during pregnancy lead to increased susceptibilities toward viral infection, hence worsening its outcome [1, 4] . The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that there were 11.764 cases of COVID 19 in pregnancy, from 29 March 2020 until 10 February 2021. Most cases contracted the infection during the second trimester (2337 cases) [5] . Allotey et al. reported that 10% of pregnant women admitted to the hospital were diagnosed as suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases (11, 432 cases) [6] . COVID-19 has a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild to severe/ critical [7] . In most pregnant women, the clinical symptoms appear to be mild, similar to the nonpregnant adult population, while approximately 14% of pregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2 have severe or critical symptoms [6, 8, 9] . Mild symptoms of COVID 19 manifest as fever, cough, anosmia, and no dyspnea, while moderate symptoms manifest as lower respiratory tract disease, with oxygen saturation >94% and radiographic evidence. In severe symptoms, oxygen saturation decreases <94% with a respiratory rate of >30×/min and radiographic findings of lung infiltrates >50%. Patients with respiratory failure, multiorgan dysfunction, or even failure are considered critical [7] . The appearance of viral pneumonia has become the common cause of death in pregnant women worldwide [1] . Diagnosis of COVID-19 in pregnant patients is performed following the same protocols as those in the nonpregnant population. Confirmed COVID-19 cases are diagnosed using a Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) examination from a naso-oropharyngeal swab. In some clinical conditions with moderate to severe dyspnea, Computerized Tomography (CT) imaging of thorax is performed to add diagnostic value and predict patient prognoses [1, 9] . As a special population, managing COVID-19 in pregnant women presents a challenge [1, 4, 8] . There is still no standardized treatment in pregnant women with COVID-19, both at national and international levels. Pregnant women were often excluded from some studies to evaluate novel therapy for COVID-19. However, these data are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 management in pregnancy [1, 2] . Remdesivir, a viral RNA polymerase inhibitor, has been used to manage severe COVID-19 in nonpregnant adults. Randomized controlled trial during Ebola epidemic has shown that Remdesivir can be safely used in pregnancy. However, data regarding the use of Remdesivir in pregnant women with moderate to severe COVID-19 are limited. Remdesivir included in our hospital guidelines for COVID-19 treatment as a choice of antiviral to be given to pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19. This study report has successfully managed five cases of COVID-19 in pregnancy with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection using Remdesivir during their hospitalization in Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Central General Hospital.@story_separate@Mrs. K, a 27-year-old pregnant woman at 27 +4 weeks of gestation, presented to our obstetric emergency unit with tachypnea (RR 28×/min; saturation 92%) one day before admission. The patient also had a fever (103.1 • F) and cough 1 week before admission. Other than that, she also had chronic hypertension. A chest X-ray showed patchy consolidation that corresponded to bilateral pneumonia. A naso-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive as tested by RT-PCR (RdRP Cq 35.15; E Gene Cq 32.10). The patient was taken care of in the High Care Unit (HCU) with oxygen therapy using 10 L per minute (Lpm) with a nonrebreathing mask (NRM), and O 2 saturation maintained at 95-97%. She was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress and superimposed preeclampsia with severe features. The patient was treated with anti-hypertension (nifedipine 4 × 10 mg), MgSO4 for seizure prevention, and dexamethasone 2 × 6 mg for lung maturation for 2 days. On hospital care day 2, tachypnea worsened (RR 32×/min), with a decreased O 2 saturation to 90% while on oxygen therapy given at 10 Lpm with NRM. The patient had an emergency cesarean section, and a baby girl was born with a birthweight of 1150 g, birth length of 34 cm, and APGAR score (AS) 7/9. The baby was taken care of in the NICU isolation for COVID-19 as a naso-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 result was negative. For postoperative observation, the patient was taken to HCU with no clinical improvement. On hospital care day 7 (HD 7), she was given Remdesivir protocol for 5 days. Tachypnea and saturation improved on HD 8 (RR 24×/min; O 2 saturation 96% with NRM 6 Lpm). Both patient and baby were discharged on HD 12 after the SARS-CoV-2 swab came back negative. Mrs. M, a 28-year-old pregnant woman at 36 weeks gestation, was diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 and was referred to our hospital due to worsening clinical symptoms. The patient had been treated in a previous hospital for 2 days with symptoms of cough and fever 4 days before admission. During hospitalization, the patient's condition worsened as she displayed tachypnea (RR 32×/min, O 2 saturation 92%) and fever (102.2 • F). A chest X-ray showed no abnormalities in both lungs. A naso-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive (N gene Cq 39.54). Oxygen saturation was 95% using oxygen therapy at 3 Lpm with a nasal cannula. An emergency cesarean section was directly performed due to the worsening of the maternal condition and oligohydramnios seen from ultrasound examination. The cesarean section was performed with no complications. A baby boy was born with a birthweight of 2345 g, a birth length of 45 cm, and AS 7/8. The baby was taken to perinatal isolation for COVID-19 with a negative result for SARS-CoV-2 from a naso-oropharyngeal swab. The patient was taken care of in HCU after surgery on day 1 postoperative (HD 1). Remdesivir was directly given with a dose of 200 mg IV on the 1st day and continued with 1 × 100 mg IV on day 2 until 5. The patient's postoperative condition was stable, and the RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 was negative on HD 4. Both patient and baby were discharged on HD 7 after Remdesivir therapy was completed. Mrs. N, a 31-year-old pregnant woman at 40 weeks gestation, presented to our obstetric emergency unit with tachypnea (RR 30×/min; O 2 saturation 93%) and fever (101.3 • F) for one week before admission. The patient had a history of flu-like symptoms and anosmia for the previous 2 weeks. A chest X-ray showed no appearance of pneumonia. Oxygen therapy was given with a nasal cannula, 4 Lpm, and O 2 saturation was 96%. SARS-CoV-2 (RdRP Cq 24.40; E Gene Cq 23.89) was confirmed using RT-PCR from a naso-oropharyngeal swab. We immediately conducted a cesarean section due to a premature rupture of the membrane with oligohydramnios. The cesarean section was successful, and a born baby boy was born, 3465 g, 51 cm, AS 8/9. The neonate was taken care of in the perinatal isolation unit for COVID-19, and a naso-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 result came back negative. The patient was taken to the isolation ward for COVID-19 for postoperative observation. The patient was given Remdesivir on HD 2 until HD 6. The patient's symptoms improved during hospitalization with a negative swab result for SARS-CoV-2 on hospital care day 6. Both patient and baby were discharged with a stable condition on HD 7. Mrs. T, a 30-year-old at 32 weeks gestation with two histories of cesarean section, presented to our obstetric emergency unit with tachypnea (RR 30×/min; O 2 saturation 93%), cough, and fever (102.2 • F). The patient had complained of tachypnea for 7 days before admission. Her naso-oropharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR (RdRP Cq 26.09; E Gene Cq 26.10) without abnormalities in a chest X-ray. The patient was treated in HCU and was given oxygen therapy 4 Lpm with a nasal cannula, and O 2 saturation was maintained at 95%. Remdesivir was given on HD 1 and continued for 6 days (HD 6). During hospitalization, the fetal condition was observed using cardiotocography, and no abnormalities were seen. Clinical symptoms improved, and the patient was discharged on HD 7 with a negative result from a naso-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. The patient underwent a cesarean section at 39 weeks gestation due to a previous cesarean section. A baby girl was born, 2700 g, 49 cm, A/S 9/10. The baby was rooming with her mother after delivery. Mrs. A, a 35-year-old at 27 weeks gestation, was referred to our institution with a fever (101.3 • F), flu-like syndrome, tachypnea (RR 28×/min; O 2 saturation 94% room air), and anosmia. The patient had complained of symptoms for 4 days before admission. A chest X-ray was normal. A naso-oropharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR (RdRP Cq 15.21; E Gene Cq 15.58) without abnormalities in a chest X-ray. The patient was taken care of in an isolation ward for COVID-19 and given oxygen therapy 4 Lpm with a nasal cannula (saturation 96-97%). Remdesivir was given on HD 1 until HD 6. Daily fetal monitoring was performed using a fetal doppler and fetal kick count chart. During hospitalization, clinical symptoms improved. The patient was discharged after 7 days of hospitalization with a repeated naso-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 result which came back negative. The patient underwent vaginal delivery at 37 weeks gestation. A baby boy was born, 3100 g, 51 cm, A/S 8/9. Both mother and baby were in good condition after delivery. Remdesivir Protocol: Day 1: 200 mg IV single dose Day 2-5: 100 mg IV/daily Remdesivir, an inhibitor RNA Polymerase, has been used in COVID-19 treatment and is known to shorten recovery time in nonpregnant women [8, 10, 11] . Unfortunately, pregnant women were being excluded in most studies. Some studies have shown that Remdesivir resulted in no adverse effects for pregnant women. Based on a randomized control trial (RCT) performed during the Ebola epidemic, Remdesivir was safe to use for pregnant women [2, 11] . In our study, no adverse events were observed from the Remdesivir therapy for both mothers and fetuses (Case A, C, and E). There was delayed Remdesivir treatment on case A (given on HD 7). However, after Remdesivir administration, the clinical condition rapidly improved during hospitalization. Our cases also showed that the period of hospitalization was shorter. This result was not only supported by better clinical outcomes but also with an improvement in laboratory findings and negative results of SARS-CoV-2 from nasooropharyngeal swabs shortly after finishing the therapy. Most patients were taken care of for 7 days (case B-E), with 6 days of Remdesivir protocol. During therapy administration, no unwanted events took place for both mothers and fetuses. Some studies have shown the safety effects of Remdesivir in pregnancy [2, 8, 11] . The FDA has recently granted emergency use of Remdesivir for severe COVID-19 in vulnerable populations, including pregnant women. A study conducted by Pierce showed that 16% of pregnant women with severe symptoms of COVID-19 treated with Remdesivir had better clinical improvement during hospitalization [8, 12] . However, more data are still needed to conclude the safety and effectiveness of the Remdesivir protocol for pregnant women infected by COVID-19. RCTs to investigate the effectiveness of Remdesivir in treating COVID-19 in pregnancy are still needed. RCT studies are still unable to be conducted in our institution for pregnant women with moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms taking ethical issues into consideration. Other antivirals that can be considered for pregnant women with COVID-19 are Oseltamivir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir [13, 14] . Oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, has been used during the Novel Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009. Based on previous studies, there were some adverse effects on fetuses, especially if it was given in the first trimester. Adverse effects due to Oseltamivir in the first trimester are spontaneous abortion (6.1%), therapeutic abortions (11.3%), and nine cases of birth defects (Ventricular Septal Defect, Anophthalmos). Besides that, the effectiveness in reducing symptoms is lower as compared to Remdesivir, particularly in moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms [13] . Lopinavir-Ritonavir, a component of HAART treatment, is frequently used for the treatment of HIV in pregnancy. This antiviral is used in order to prevent mother-tochild transmission. The efficacy in treating COVID-19 in pregnancy remains unclear and warrants further studies [14] . In our observations, there were increasing D-Dimer levels in our patients (A-E) ( Table 1) . Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) treatment was given to patients D and E, while patients B and C did not get heparin therapy as a cesarean section was immediately performed. In postoperative observations, the D-Dimer level was decreasing (See supplementary material). Patient A also did not get LMW as clinical improvements were observed postoperatively, but no complete data could be obtained in regard to the patient's D-Dimer levels ( Table 1) . LMWH is known to decrease the risk of thromboembolic in pregnant patients with COVID 19 and also to improve prognosis with severe symptoms [15] . During Remdesivir and LMWH therapy, we observed no adverse events and worsening of conditions in patients, fetuses, and also neonates. But further studies are still needed to evaluate the adverse events from the interactions of these two medications. Our experience in managing pregnant women with COVID-19 using the Remdesivir protocol was uneventful. Some limitations in this study were short period in which the study was conducted, and there were only a few cases. Another limitation is that no control case was used as a comparison to evaluate the effectiveness of Remdesivir. Although our study has some limitations, we strongly suggest the use of the Remdesivir protocol for pregnant women with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19, pend-ing FDA approval, remembering the current time of pandemic we are in that necessitates emergency protocol and also no observation of harmful events. There is still no standardized therapy, including an antiviral regiment, that is recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in pregnancy, especially in moderate-severe cases. A randomized controlled trial is also unethical to perform in these cases. Further studies with more cases are needed with the inclusion of pregnant women in Remdesivir clinical trials to give a perspective on its safety, efficacy, and adverse effects towards the mothers, fetuses, and neonates.@story_separate@Remdesivir protocol for pregnant women with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19 showed no adverse effects during hospitalization, clinically improved, and shortened recovery during hospitalization. Further study and randomized controlled trial (RCT) are needed to evaluate biosafety and its effect on the Remdesivir protocol in pregnant women.","Introduction: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that causes novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major health problem worldwide and been declared a pandemic since March 2020 by WHO. One special population that poses a challenge is pregnant women with COVID-19. There have not been many studies related to COVID-19 in pregnancy. In this study, we present five serial cases of Remdesivir treatment for COVID-19 in pregnant women with moderate to severe symptoms. Case Illustration: We briefly describe five serial cases being treated with Remdesivir therapy during hospitalization. Four cases were delivered by cesarean section, and one was delivered vaginally in gestation week 37. All cases showed a shortened duration of hospitalization, rapid improvement in clinical symptoms, and no adverse events were observed in mothers, fetuses, and neonates. Discussion: Remdesivir, an inhibitor RNA Polymerase, has been used in COVID-19 treatment and is known to shorten recovery time in nonpregnant women. Some studies have shown no adverse effects on Remdesivir for pregnant women. Based on randomized control trial (RCT) during the Ebola epidemic, Remdesivir was safe to use for pregnant women. All cases showed reduced hospitalization time and better clinical outcomes without maternal, fetal, or neonatal adverse events. Conclusion: Remdesivir protocol for pregnant women with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19 has resulted in better clinical improvement with a shorter recovery period and no adverse effects during the hospitalization period. Further studies and RCT are warranted to evaluate the biosafety and effects of Remdesivir in pregnant women."
"The world population is facing a severe mass annihilation due to the rise of a global pandemic named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Boopathi et al., 2020; Chatterjee et al., 2020; Joshi et al., 2020; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016) . This pandemic is caused by a novel single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the b-coronavirus genera of the coronaviridae family (Elfiky & Azzam, 2020; Enmozhi et al., 2020; Sarma et al., 2020; Sinha et al., 2020) . As this virus shares significant phylogenetic similarity and structural familiarity (about 80% nucleotide identity and 89.10% nucleotide similarity) with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), it has been named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and placed in the same lineage (Subgenus Sarbecovirus) (2020; Boopathi et al., 2020; Das et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; . To date, no effective regime of antivirals or vaccines is available for the use of the general public to combat the effect of COVID infections, which has put the population at a more vulnerable position (Aanouz et al., 2020; Elfiky, 2020; Elmezayen et al., 2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020; Pant et al., 2020) . The transmission of the virus is taking place at a massive rate worldwide, and hence the scientists all over the world are desperately looking for effective compounds to use it as anti-CoV therapeutic agents. Natural compounds with high bioavailability and low cytotoxicity seem to be the most efficient candidates in this regard. Since ancient times, humans have resorted to the use of natural compounds, especially phytochemicals, for the treatment of different diseases and disorders (Forni et al., 2019; Islam et al., 2020) . Flavonoids are secondary metabolites produced by plants, play vital roles in plant physiology, possessing a variety of potential biological benefits such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities (Islam et al., 2020; Kumar & Pandey, 2013; Panche et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018) . Different flavonoids, including flavones and flavonols, have been thoroughly investigated for their potential antiviral properties. Many of them showed a significant antiviral response in both in vitro and in vivo studies Nijveldt et al., 2001) . Curcumin, a component of turmeric, has been described to exhibit enhanced antiviral activity against diverse viruses such as dengue virus (serotype 2), herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Zika, and chikungunya viruses among others (Mounce et al., 2017; Praditya et al., 2019) . Apigenin isolated from the sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) plant has shown potent antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus, adenoviruses, african swine fever virus, and some RNA viruses in vitro (Chiang et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2017) . Luteolin, another acclaimed flavone, has shown significant antiviral effects on both HIV-1 reactivation and inhibition of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation in cells (Wu et al., 2016) . Besides these antiviral activities, luteolin also showed antiviral effects against Chikungunya virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (Fan et al., 2016) , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and rhesus rotavirus. Among flavonols, the antiviral effect of quercetin has been most extensively investigated. Quercetin has been found to demonstrate an in vitro dose-dependent antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus, poliovirus type 1, HSV-1, and HSV-2. It was also reported that quercetin has the potential ability as a prophylactic against Ebola virus infection (Hasan et al., 2020; Kaul et al., 1985) . Kaempferol, another flavonol extracted from Ficus benjamina leaves, has shown inhibitory activity against HCMV, HSV-1, HSV-2, and influenza A virus (Lyu et al., 2005; Zakaryan et al., 2017) . Fisetin, a modified flavonol, has shown to inhibit CHIKV infection as well as the HIV-1 infection by blocking viral entry and virus-cell fusion (Zakaryan et al., 2017) . Resveratrol and pterostibenes have been found to exhibit antiviral activities against a wide range of viruses, including HIV-1 (Abba et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2017) . Resveratrol has been shown to inhibit the replication of pseudorabies virus (PVR) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and also reduced the expression of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein (Campagna & Rivas, 2010; Docherty et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017) . Pterostilbene, a natural dimethylated analog of resveratrol found in berries and grapes, has been found to inhibit the replication of several viruses, including herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, influenza virus, and human papillomaviruses. Considering the contagiousness of the COVID-19 and its consequences, there is an imperative need to develop an effective therapy to curtail the spread of this deadly virus and safely treat the infected individuals. In that direction, the repurposing of the FDA approved existing drugs like chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) either alone or in combination with other known drugs are currently being attempted (Al-Bari, 2017; Yao et al., 2020) . Preliminary in vitro studies and clinical trials carried out by scientists on COVID-19 patients disclosed the effectiveness of HCQ, an anti-malarial drug in combination with azithromycin, a broad spectrum anti-bacterial drug in reducing the viral load . Although some of these initial studies disclosed promising results, a lot still remains to be done to analyze their compatibility, cost, accessibility, side effects, dosages, etc. Currently, scientists are indulging themselves in identifying ideal natural compounds that can target and modulate unique or novel sites like the spike glycoprotein (S) on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 (Adedeji et al., 2013; Elfiky & Azzam, 2020; Sarma et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020) . In this in silico study, we have performed molecular docking experiments to ascertain the most potent natural compounds (flavonoids) that can bind to the functional domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2S), a viral surface glycoprotein required for initial attachment and internalisation within host cells (Abdelli et al., 2020; Adedeji et al., 2013; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016) . Here we found that about 10 of these compounds effectively bind to the C-terminal region of either the S1 domain or the S2 domain of SARS-CoV-2S, and their binding interaction is more stable than with that of HCQ. These natural compounds are capable of binding to either the S1 or S2 domains of the SARS-CoV-2S protein and most probably prevent it from binding to the hACE2 receptor or internalization during fusion (Hasan et al., 2020; Zhou & Simmons, 2012) . Further, our MD simulation studies reveal that phytochemicals fisetin, quercetin, and kamferol has the propensity to bind at the junction of the hACE2-S protein complex with lesser binding energy. In addition, in-depth in vitro and in vivo with these lead molecules may help to explore as novel anti-COVID-19 agents. , and Apigenin (CID: 5280443)] was downloaded from the PubChem database, and then these structures were converted in pdb format by using PyMol (DeLano, 2002) . The structure of SARS-CoV-2S protein was downloaded from the RCSB protein data bank (PDB-ID: 6VYB) (DeLano, 2002; Walls et al., 2020) . The structure of all the ligands has been provided in Table S1 (Supplementary material).@story_separate@First, the SARS-CoV-2S, and ligand were converted into pdbqt format using AutoDock tools. Polar hydrogens and gasteiger charges were added to SARS-CoV-2S and other ligand structure before docking. The cryo-electron microscopic structure of SARS-CoV-2S was used for the molecular docking analysis. SARS-CoV-2S protein is a heterotrimer consisting of chains A, B, and C (Walls et al., 2020) . For the docking experiment, chain A of the spike protein was used. First, the SARS-CoV-2S, kamferol, and HCQ were converted into pdbqt format using AutoDock tools (Morris et al., 2009) . Polar hydrogens and gasteiger charges were added to SARS-CoV-2S, kamferol, and HCQ structure before docking. The molecular docking tool AutoDock Vina (Trott & Olson, 2010) was used to study the binding of curcumin and hydroxychloroquine on the SARS-CoV-2S. Further, blind docking of kamferol was performed to ascertain the probable binding sites. For this, the entire SARS-CoV-2S molecule was covered with a grid box of dimension 76 Å Â 92 Å Â 160 Å with grid spacing 1 Å. The SARS-CoV-2S was kept rigid while the kamferol was kept flexible. The four sets of docking were performed with exhaustiveness 100. Each set of AutoDock Vina produced 9 conformations (Trott & Olson, 2010) . Among them, 6 conformations were docked at one domain of SARS-CoV-2S, that domain is used for the direct docking. For local docking, SARS-CoV-2S was covered with the grid box of dimension 60 Å Â 54 Å Â 66 Å with grid spacing 1 Å. The exhaustiveness was kept at 100. Four sets of local docking were performed for each ligand and the site, and the site where maximum number of conformations bind was considered the binding site. The conformations with high negative binding energy are represented in the figures. The docking results were analyzed using MGL Tools 1.5.6 (Morris et al., 2009) , and the hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions were determined using PyMol (DeLano, 2002) . Similar to kamferol, the docking of other ligand was performed on the SARS-CoV-2S protein. The docking parameters of all the ligand have been provided in Table 1 . The biomolecular software package GROMACS-2018.1 (Kutzner et al., 2019) was used for the molecular dynamics simulations of the protein-ligand complex with the protein interactions approximated by the CHARMM36 force field and ligand parameters generated using CgenFF . For each protein-ligand complex, we place the respective complex in the center of a cubic box with 10 Å distance to the edges and fill the box with TIP3P water and counter ions (Na þ Cl À ) 0.15 M added to neutralize the system (Joung & Cheatham, 2008) . The simulation box of protein complexed with fistein, kamferol and quercontain contain water molecules, 178467, 178474 and 136669, respectively. Because of periodic boundary conditions, electrostatic interactions were evaluated using particle-Ewald summation, and a cut-off of 10 Å was used for the calculation of vdW-interactions. The resulting systems were energy-minimized by steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods, followed by a short (500 ps) equilibration in NVT ensemble and subsequent 500 ps in an NPT ensemble. Temperature and pressure were set T ¼ 310 K and 1 bar, which was controlled by a Parrinello-Danadio-Bussi thermostat and Parrinello-Rahman barostat (Bussi et al., 2007; Parrinello & Rahman, 1980) . The integration step of 2 fs was used. Each system was simulated for 100 ns, and the snapshots were saved every 10 ps for further analysis. We analyze the resulting trajectories using the tools provided by the GROMACS package (Abraham et al., 2015) . Several structural parameters that we measure and analyze include the root-meansquare deviation (RMSD), the radius of gyration (Rg), solventaccessible-surface-area (SASA), root-mean-square-fluctuation (RMSF), hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and binding free energy (Islam et al., 2020; Jain et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2018; Sarma et al., 2020) . Hydrogen bonds were defined by a distance cut-off of 3.5 Å between the donor & acceptor atom and an angle cut-off of 30 . Utilizing the MD trajectory, the binding free energies for ligands with S protein were calculated using MM-PBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area). Considering the convergence issues, the snapshots at an interval of 10 ps were extracted from the last 20 ns of each trajectory and used for the MM-PBSA calculation (Batt et al., 2012; Prakash & Luthra, 2012) . The solute dielectric constant value of 2 and salt concentration of 0.15 M was used for the calculation (Kumar et al., 2019; Pandey et al., 2018) . Binding free energy of protein-ligand complexes were calculated as, where, G complex represents the free energy of the protein-ligand complex, G receptor , the free energy of protein, G ligand as the free energy of ligand, and < > represent the ensemble average. ADME profiling of fisetin, quercetin, and kamferol at pH 7 were determined using online software tools (Jayaram et al., 2012) . The important parameters allied with ADME properties such as Lipinski's rule of five, solubility of drug, pharmacokinetic properties, molar refractivity, and drug likeliness were deliberated (Lipinski, 2004) . In the field of computer-aided drug designing, particularly for the identification of a lead compound (Hughes et al., 2011; Raj et al., 2019) , molecular docking is immensely employed to explore the various types of binding interaction of the prospective drug with different domains or active sites on the target molecules. Among all different types of interactions such as H-bond, p-p, amide-p interactions, etc., the binding efficacy of a ligand molecule with the active sites of a target has widely been explained by evaluating its hydrogen bonding pattern Raj et al., 2019) and the nature of residues present at the active site. The binding energy (kcal/mol) data allows us to study and compare the binding affinity of different ligands/compounds with their corresponding target receptor molecule. The lower binding energy indicates a higher affinity of the ligand for the receptor. The ligand with the highest affinity can be chosen as the potential drug for further studies. The SARS-CoV-2S is a surface glycoprotein of 2019 novel coronavirus (Ou et al., 2020; Wahedi et al., 2020) . This protein plays important roles during viral attachment, fusion, and entry into the host cells (Adedeji et al., 2013; Boopathi et al., 2020; . Biologically this protein exists in a heterotrimeric form with three separate polypeptide chains: chain A, B, and C, forming each monomer (Boopathi et al., 2020; Li et al., 2006) . For the present study, ten phytochemicals of flavonoids and non-flavonoids class with a broad range of biological activities along with one FDA-approved anti-malarial drug HCQ which exhibited efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 have been selected as ligands to investigate their binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2S chain A as the receptor target protein. The docking study revealed that out of the three different domains, namely S1-N terminal, S1-C terminal, and S2, these phytochemicals and HQC exhibited binding affinity mainly for two domains: S1-C terminal and S2 of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among all the ligands, 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroxy-4Hchromen-4-one (fisetin) ( Table 2 ) 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5,7-trihydroxy-4H-chromen-4-one (quercetin) and (Table 2) displayed lowest and identical binding energy of À8.5 kcal/ mol as well as similar binding preferences for S2 domain of the spike protein. Despite having a similar preference for the S2 domain, the presence of an additional 5-OH group on the chromone ring of quercetin affected its hydrogen bonding interactions compared to fisetin, which was also reflected in their interaction with different residues of S2 domain. As shown in Figure 1C and Figure 1E and Table 2) . Similarly, lack of one hydroxyl (-OH) group at 3 0 -C of phenyl ring in case of 3,5,7-trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4Hchromen-4-one (kamferol) ( Figure 1F , G and Table 2 ) not only lead to the reduction in binding affinity (À7.4 kcal/mol) but it also leads to binding at S1 domain rather than S2 domain which were observed in case of other three flavonols. Like-wise the binding studies performed with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which has emerged as a potent therapeutic option against COVID-19 and received much attention in the last few days, revealed the lowest binding affinity (À5.6 kcal/mol) among all others (Table 2) . It interacts with ALA 520, GLN564, PHE 565, ARG 567, and HIS 519 residues through hydrogen bond formation. It forms the hydrophobic interaction with LEU 518, LEU 517, CYS 391, LEU 546, and ALA 522. The lowest binding affinity observed with HCQ could be attributed to the presence of a conformationally labile and sterically bulkier carbon chain, which probably disrupts the interaction of the HCQ with the binding site resulting in reduced binding affinity. Overall the docking study discloses two different sets of ligands which bind at S1 and S2 domains of SARS-CoV-2S. We thought that if these molecules interact with either S1 or S2 domain strongly, it may perturb the hACE2-S protein complex interaction. So, based on the binding energy, we selected these top phytochemicals for our further in silico study. The molecular docking analyses resulted in the selection of three phytochemicals, fistein, kamferol, and quercetin which show promising activity against hACE2-S protein complex. However, during the biological functions, proteins undergo substantial conformational changes, and aqueous environment around the protein plays a functional role in protein-ligand interactions (Luthra et al., 2009; Mongre et al., 2019; Yu and Dalby, 2018) . Thus, to better understand the conformational stability of ligand binding and the contribution of the active site in terms of binding free energy, we performed MD simulation in solvated condition at physiological To investigate the overall conformational dynamics and stability of the protein-ligand complex, we calculated the RMSD values relative to the starting structure for the backbones of all residues (Figure 2 ). The probability distribution plot of the docked structure of hACE2-S protein with fistein shows that the population of stable conformational dynamics is settled around $18-20 Å. We find a small population density between 5 and 10 Å, which indicates the initial perturbation in the structure fistein is well-adjusted at the binding pocket; thus, the dynamic equilibrium shifted to a stable population of the complex. The time evolution plot of RMSD shown in Supplementary Figure 2 shows that the complex structure of fistein achieves equilibrium at $40 ns and remains stable till the simulation ends at 100 ns. Whereas, the population of complex structure with kamferol is largely stabilized around $17-20 Å. The splitting in the RMSD distribution plot, which can be seen near 15 Å, 20 Å, and 30 Å, respectively, suggested different drifts in the trajectory during the dynamic progression. The detailed view of the time evolution plot suggested that the structure of hACE2-S protein complexed with kamferol attains equilibrium at $10 ns, which is continued up to 40 ns. A consistent increase in RMSD is observed up to 70 ns; after that, the RMSD dropped quickly and attainded stable equilibrium, which is maintained until 100 ns. The RMSD distribution plot of complex structure with quercetin shows the higher population density >60% near 23-24 Å, which indicates the stable conformational dynamics of protein-ligand complex. The time evolution view of hACE2-S protein complexed with quercetin also provides a clear view that the complex structure attains equilibrium at $10 ns and remains stable for the remaining period of simulation. Thus, the RMSD results denote that all three ligands remain occupied at active site stabilized with potential interactions. To evaluate the dynamic adaptability and overall compactness of the ligand-bound complex structure of hACE2-S protein, we calculated the probability distribution plot of radius of gyration (Rg) (Rocco et al., 2008; Singh et al., 2019) . Results show that the Rg values of fistein ranged between 42.0 and 43.0 Å, whereas, the higher population density of Rg values ranged between $42.0-44.0 Å and $47.0-48.0 Å for kamferol and quercetin, respectively (Figure 3) . The narrow Rg distribution ranges of highly populated conformational dynamics suggested the minimal variations in the structural compactness of protein. Thus, the overall protein-ligand complexes remain stable during the simulation, which is observed consistent with RMSD analyses. To monitor the structural stability of the ligand-bound complex of hACE2-S protein, we also computed the probability distribution plot of the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), shown in Figure 4 . This plot shows that the distribution of highly populated structure of all three complex restricted around $64,000 Å 2 , which provide elegant evidence of stable conformational dynamics of the protein-ligand complex in an aqueous environment. Thus, the results collectively obtained from probability distribution plots of RMSD, Rg, and SASA suggested that the complexation of ligands at the active site enhances the conformational stability hACE2-S protein. In addition, to evaluate the molecular interaction, we also examine the time evolution plot of hydrogen bond (H-bond) formed between the protein and ligands ( Figure 5 ). H-bond acts as a key interaction in determining the binding affinity, selectivity, and stabilization effect of ligands with protein. From Figure 5 , we find that the initial trajectory of fistein shows the appearance of five H-bonds with hACE2-S protein, out of which three H-bonds were observed consistently during the simulation. The H-bond plot of kamferol shows the occurrence of three-four H-bonds with protein; however, two H-bond interactions were found more stable, which can be seen retained throughout the simulation. Whereas, the H-bond plot of quercetin shows a maximum of six H-bond interactions with hACE2-S protein, during the initial 0-15 ns. During the progression of simulation, three H-bonds were observed up to 40 ns, and only two remained long-lived, which were maintained during the entire simulation time.  To probe the conformational dynamics of protein-ligand complexes during the simulation, we applied principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA is an efficient tool which quantitatively defines the collective motion and measures the movement directions (David & Jacobs, 2014; Kumar et al., 2020; Sarma et al., 2020) . The principal components, PC1 and PC2, were obtained from diagonalization of the covariance matrix of the Ca atomic fluctuation and were used as reaction coordinates to calculate the Gibbs free energy landscape (FEL). FEL plot ( Figure 6 ) displayed that the complex of hACE2-S protein with three compounds, fisetin, kamferol, and quercetin, spans different subspace of structures during the period of 100 ns simulation. It is observed that the collective motion of fistein is confined to a small conformational space. The population of complex structures occupying the small energy basins represents the initial conformation of the optimization phase, the ligand well settled at the binding pocket which is subsequentially visited is broad energy basins, having the population of stable protein-ligand complex. The structure of hACE2-S protein complexed with kamferol navigated a broad conformational space, the collective motion of protein in the three different energy wells represents the different conformational stability of protein-ligand complex. The small energy basin represents the initial equilibration phase; then, the complex structure shifted to another energy basin, which is relatability more stable. Finally, the structure transverse through the small energy barrier to a broader energy basin, having population of a more stable complex. It may be the reason we observed two drifts at $20 ns and $75 ns in RMSD trajectory, representing the two different but stable conformational states between $25-60 ns and $80-100 ns. Quercetin experiences wide conformational space, visiting through the three energy basins. The structure crosses smoothly from one subspace to another subspace through the small energy barrier; thus, we observed that stable conformation of protein-ligand during the initial 0-40 ns, due to excursion protein jump out from the stable energy basin, navigated the broad conformational, representing the rugged energy basin. However, during the dynamics progression, protein acquired equilibrium with the dropdown in RMSD and entered to deep energy basin, suggesting the population of stable protein-ligand structures. Collectively, the structural dynamics analyses and FEL suggested the stable conformation dynamics of the docked complex of hACE2-S protein complex with ligands, fistein, kamferol, and quercetin. In order to understand the contribution of active site residues which influence the binding free energy and structural stability of ligands during the dynamic progression, we applied MM-PBSA Pandey et al., 2018) . MM-PBSA determines the strength of binding by calculating the absolute binding free energies (DG bind ) which is sum of the electrostatic, Van der Waals interaction, polar and nonpolar solvation free energies (Supplementary Figure 3) . In addition, the contribution of each residue to the binding free energy was also calculated for the aforesaid energy terms. The estimated energy components for binding of fistein, kamferol, and quercetin with hACE2-S protein are summarized in Table 2 . The compound quercetin shows the lowest binding free energy DG bind ¼ À22.17 ± 3.04 kcal mol À1 which indicates the highest binding affinity for hACE2-S protein. The lowest binding affinity was observed with kamferol which shows DG bind ¼ À15.07 ± 2.42 kcal mol À1 . Whereas, the binding of fistein with hACE2-S protein shows DG bind ¼ À21.11 ± 3.49 kcal mol À1 . This suggests that the binding affinity of quercetin and fistein to hACE2-S protein remains almost with equal potency, which is consistent with molecular docking results, showing similar docked score DG ¼ À8.50 kcal mol À1 . Thus, MM-PBSA results strengthen the molecular docking and conformational dynamics observation, which suggested the stable binding of fistein, kamferol, and quercetin with hACE2-S protein. These results may contribute to the understanding of structure-based designing in the development of COVID-19 therapy. It is generally used to Gupta et al., 2020; Jayaram et al., 2012; Lipinski, 2004 ) evaluate potential interactions between the drug and other target non-drug molecules. It evaluates the propensity of a compound with a certain pharmacological or biological activity to be used as a potential drug. It acts as a filter to screen potential therapeutic agents/drugs just at the initiation of the program, thereby minimizing the labour and cost of exercises involving clinical drug development and to a large extent preventing late-stage clinical failures. The rule mainly determines the molecular properties of a compound, which are its prime requisition to be a potential drug, like absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Lipinski's rule states that for any compound to be selected as a potential drug it should have (a) Molecular mass < 500 Dalton (b) high lipophilicity (expressed as LogP 5) (c) less than 5 hydrogen bond donors (d) Less than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (e) molar refractivity between 40 and 130. If a compound of interest possesses more than two of the aforementioned criteria, then the compound is likely to be a potential candidate for drug development. All three selected phytochemicals used in this study were found to pass all the five criteria mentioned above in Lipinski's rule (Table 3 ). Thus we suggest that all of these phytochemicals have the potential ability to work effectively as novel drugs. In vitro and in vivo experiments with our selected group of potential anti-viral compounds will strengthen our perspectives that natural products based therapeutic interventions is the need of the hour. Herbal medicines formulated from the phytochemicals we predicted, will be extremely essential for the identification of anti-COVID-19 inhibitors. @story_separate@Molecular docking and MD simulation is the best platform to screen potential drug candidates. In this study, we described the binding ability of naturally occurring phytochemicals with the SARS-CoV2-S protein. Further, using MD simulation, we showed that kamferol, quercetin, and fisetin bind to the hACE2-S-protein complex, near the interface of hACE2 and S-protein binding. Our results were supported by other analyses like the free energy estimation of binding using MM-PBSA and free energy landscape. Further, we found that these compounds satisfy all criteria of Lipinski's rule of five. Therefore, we believe that these compounds could be potential anti-COVID drugs; hence the researcher in this field should verify this using in vitro experimental techniques.","Spike glycoprotein, a class I fusion protein harboring the surface of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2S), plays a seminal role in the viral infection starting from recognition of the host cell surface receptor, attachment to the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cells. Spike glycoprotein engages host Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for entry into host cells, where the receptor recognition and attachment of spike glycoprotein to the ACE2 receptors is a prerequisite step and key determinant of the host cell and tissue tropism. Binding of spike glycoprotein to the ACE2 receptor triggers a cascade of structural transitions, including transition from a metastable pre-fusion to a post-fusion form, thereby allowing membrane fusion and internalization of the virus. From ancient times people have relied on naturally occurring substances like phytochemicals to fight against diseases and infection. Among these phytochemicals, flavonoids and non-flavonoids have been the active sources of different anti-microbial agents. We performed molecular docking studies using 10 potential naturally occurring compounds (flavonoids/non-flavonoids) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and compared their affinity with an FDA approved repurposed drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Further, our molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and energy landscape studies with fisetin, quercetin, and kamferol revealed that these molecules bind with the hACE2-S complex with low binding free energy. The study provided an indication that these molecules might have the potential to perturb the binding of hACE2-S complex. In addition, ADME analysis also suggested that these molecules consist of drug-likeness property, which may be further explored as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma"
"When not properly managed, cardiac arrest may lead to permanent brain damage and eventually death due to reduced blood flow. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a technique used to resuscitate someone that has a sudden heart attack. This is carried out by either performing breathing assistance or giving oxygen to the lungs and chest compressions to drain blood until the heart rate and breathing returns to normal state and medical assistance arrives. 1 CPR is defined as a life-saving emergency procedure that combines both artificial ventilation and chest compressions to maintain a stable blood circulation to the brain during the event of a sudden cardiac arrest. However, recent studies have shown that the survival rates remained low at 11.4% for outpatient heart attacks and 23.8% for hospital heart attacks, even when CPR pro-cedures were applied. 2 The COVID-19 pandemic, which started in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, is a deadly virus that attacks the respiratory system and is transmitted rapidly through physical contact and air. This pandemic has caused a negative impact to all countries all over the world, especially with the implementation of a regional lockdown status where community activities are hampered. This has affected government institutions, private companies, entrepreneurship, transportation, tourism, education, and many other sectors. 3, 4 The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about changes in the various aspects of life, especially in the field of education where learning needs to be conducted frequently and updated. Furthermore, lessons that were once conducted physically in the classroom are now being taught on virtual meetings online to prevent further spread of the virus. Everyone is expected to adapt to the use of modern technology and the industrial revolution 4.0, especially for both educators and students. 4 CPR training and its quality are critical in increasing the rate of surviving heart attack. In preparation for clinical practice at the hospital, students are required to have competent basic life support (BLS) especially of conducting CPR. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the implementation of lockdowns and maintaining social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. This affected the ability of nursing students to conduct CPR due to inadequate manual training. 2, 5, 6 Therefore, guidance from professional societies and biomedical ethicists about how and when to perform CPR is needed. Some extreme views on this topic have already emerged, including calls for a universal do-not-resuscitate policy for patients infected with COVID-19. It is necessary to have learning innovations and participate in creative discussions, through various learning media applications in order for learning activities to run smoothly in a sustainable manner and with fun. 7 A study conducted in Armenia shows that tele-education is effective and beneficial when applied in developing countries. In this study, it was also stated that there was a significant increase in the assessment of knowledge after the lecture ended. Therefore, this new method of learning is considered very important, valuable, understandable, easy, and applicable to nurses that have never been previously been exposed to it. The virtual reality (VR) technology also makes it possible to conduct online training by implementing virtual three-dimensional CPR procedures. This would improve the skills and knowledge of nursing students compared to face-to-face training. 2, 7 Based on the above benefits provided from using online learning methods, the purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and knowledge of nursing students in performing CPR procedures by implementing a blended learning program through online learning platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic.@story_separate@This study was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines, and the data-based literature search was carried out in May 2020 in which the articles selected were of repute. They were limited from the published year 2010 to 2020 and reviewed systematically to obtain empirical evidence regarding the efficacy and knowledge of performing CPR through online learning. Search engines such as ProQuest, ScienceDirect and PubMed were used during the literature research. This was carried out by using a keyword combination ""BLS"", ""CPR"", ""Blended learning"", ""Knowledge"" and ""Self-efficacy"" with Boolean search methods such as the ""AND"", ""OR"" and ""NOT"" to get related articles that meet the objectives of the literature review. The determination of the inclusion and exclusion criteria was based on the PICOS (population, intervention, comparators, outcomes and study design) method which was adjusted to the meet the objectives of the literature review. The determination of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table 1 . Based on the results from the literature searches through publications in three databases, 745 articles were found that matched the keywords used. Furthermore, after checking for duplication, about 112 articles had similar contents and were excluded, leaving a total of 633 remaining. They were further screened based on the title and abstract and 165 articles that meant the purpose were obtained. Furthermore, they were screened based on full text, which resulted to 74 suitable articles. The feasibility assessment of the 74 articles were based on the overall text and conformity with the eligibility criteria. Therefore, 66 articles were not suitable and only 15 could be used in the literature review. The results of the study selection are illustrated in a flowchart using the PRIS-MA selection process in Figure 1 . Information was also extracted from the 15 articles in the form of authors, research objectives, population selection, intervention selection, research design, data analysis techniques, educational content, samples, year of publication, and the language used from each study according to the research objectives. The results from the review of the 15 articles are related to the efficacy and knowledge of performing CPR through online learning and the articles were published from 2010 to 2020. The articles were experimental studies, namely a randomized controlled trial (73,33%, 11/15), a quasi-experiment (13.33%, 2/15), and non-inferiority trial (13.33%, 2/15). The number of samples from the articles found ranged from 41 to 50,000 samples with a total of 71,332. It was observed that there was a positive effect on the efficacy and knowledge of performing CPR through online learning (Table 2) . CPR is an important procedure in the event of a sudden cardiac arrest in order for the patient to survive. This process is usually carried out with the assistance of breathing and chest compressions. Structured training in increasing self-efficacy, knowledge and performance that was normally conducted during faceto-face learning in classes was constrained by the COVID-19 pan-Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Table 2 . Summary on the efficacy and knowledge of doing cardiopulmonary resuscitation through online learning in the COVID-19 pandemic. Randomized controlled trial The serious games used in the study were not superior to the online courses used in training medical students in the management of heart attacks. The absence of a correlation between evaluated student performance during two training sessions separated by 4 months suggests that elements such as chest compressions could only be studied with simulation based training. Napp 17 808 samples Randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial Online education is an effective alternative for preparing prospective BLS instructors. By using free online courses, people that are motivated could independently acquire the skills necessary to become instructors and realize low-cost BLS training in schools. Nord et al. 18 432 samples Randomized controlled trial A web course before CPR training did not influence practical CPR skills or willingness to act, but improved the students' theoretical knowledge of AMI, stroke and lifestyle factors. Boada et al .20 41 samples Quasi-experimentation Virtual simulation using different scenarios is an appropriate strategy for practicing car diopulmonary resuscitation procedures in a safe and risk-free manner for the patient, there by improving CPR performance. Tobase et al. 21 94 samples Randomized controlled trial The online course was an effective method for teaching and learning key BLS skills wherein students were able to accurately apply BLS procedures during the CPR simulation. This short-term online training, which likely improves learning and self-efficacy in BLS providers, can be used for the continuing education of health professionals. Twohig et al. 22 948 samples Randomized controlled trial ECPR is a sophisticated treatment option which may improve outcomes in a selected patient population in refractory cardiac arrest. Further comparative research is needed clarify the role of this potential resuscitative therapy. Lau et al. 23 15.528 samples Randomized controlled trial Meta-analyses revealed that trainees in digital resuscitation training had better knowledge scores but poorer chest compression rates than that of trainees in standard resuscitation training. Digital resuscitation trainings were non-inferior to standard resuscitation trainings in skill performance scores. Subgroup analyses suggested that digital resuscitation training might consider using blended learning approach with virtual patient, computer-screen based, learning theories and video-recorded assessment, especially for basic life support trainings amongst health professionals. Zhou et al. 24 60 samples Randomized controlled trial Compared with the traditional teaching methods, the effect of combined mode of MOOC micro-video in emergency nursing practice especially doing CPR is the same as that of traditional teaching methods, but the satisfaction is higher, so it is more suitable to be used in nursing practice during the COVID-19 epidemic period, so as to effectively reduce the cross-infection between doctors, nurses, and teaching staff. Nas et al. 26 50.000 samples Randomized controlled trial The Lowlands Saves Lives trial will create awareness for the importance of bystander CPR and aims to increase willingness and capability to participate in CPR that important insights into the efficacy of innovative CPR training methods which may help to improve CPR skills of layperson rescuers, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes after cardiac arrest.

This made people carry out social distancing in order to prevent further spread of the virus. 8, 9 Online learning-based education was carried out to improve the skills and abilities of nursing students in performing CPR even though it was done remotely. 8 Factors that affect the efficacy and knowledge of performing CPR through online learning include difficulty to simulate the correct performance of the procedure, the compression rhythm and depth are difficult to realistically assess, and the ventilation provided is difficult to simulate. 10 Then analyzing the effects of online learning in performing CPR on the efficacy and the knowledge of nursing students, there was an increase in their skills and simulation via video and web-based lectures. This learning method makes it easier for students to follow because of the flexibility of space and time compared to direct training. In addition, online learning methods attract young people and should be used as a means of training. 9, 10 According to Akhu-Zaheya et al., 11 self-efficacy could be obtained, changed, increased or decreased through several sources, due to performance accomplishment, social persuasion and emotional states. In an empirical research, it was proven that self-efficacy is still a major predictor of success in online learning compared to traditional face-to-face learning in classes. Furthermore, the small group discussion (SGD) renewal program was more effective than watching the (PWW) program. 12 Based on the research statement by Park, 13 blended E-learning with self-directed repeated learning is more effective in improving nursing competence, self-efficacy, problem solving, and psychomotor skills for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. Rather than conventional practical education. This is similar to a research conducted by Moon and Hyun, 9 on 120 respondents, using the CPR blended learning program method that integrates video and face-to-face lectures effectively in increasing the knowledge and attitudes of nursing students. Effective training involving emergency treatment through online learning is very effective and affects the self-efficacy, knowledge, problem solving and actual clinical practice performance skills required by nurses. 13 This is in line with Chien and colleagues' research, which states that the mixed CPR training program is not inferior to the ones done traditionally, and integrates online learning and simulation in order for assessment of compression depth, CPR knowledge, practicality, quality of CPR performance, and skill retention becomes a significant result. 14 Many online learning methods were carried out using alternative electronic media applications and games to support competencies that need be achieved due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Simulation-based training that using online games were also used in learning CPR procedures. This is in line with research from Boada et al., 1 in which learning was carried out using the game Life Support Simulation Activities (LISSA), which works on 3D virtual games in conducting CPR training. It was able to increase student's knowledge and efficacy compared to traditional classroom learning. 1 In addition, Drummond et al. also stated that the online method with simulation-based training games was more superior to use. 15 Virtual simulation using scenarios could be an appropriate strategy for practicing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) procedures in a safe and risk-free manner for the patient, thereby improving CPR performance. 16 The success of the CPR procedure was supported by good comprehensive training facilities through online learning because of the advantages of it being more practical, and professionals find it more flexible to use. A research conducted by Napp and colleagues showed that preparing BLS instructors with online learning was more effective than face-to-face training in class. 17 In Nord and co-authors' study, an interactive web course using elearning simulation software preparation by a health care provider does not improve practical CPR skills, but knowledge about increasing knowledge of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke and lifestyle factors; this learning flexibility is seen in terms of location and time and cost. 18 Factors that influence selfefficacy in online learning experiences are age, level of education, and experience. 19 The study by Boada et al. 20 evaluates how characteristics of the sex of the victim in a scenario designed to practice cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol (CPR) affected performance student nurses, the result is a virtual scenario can be an appropriate strategy to reduce gender differences in gender sensitive situations such as CPR performance. Online learning is an effective method for learning-teaching skills where students BLS able to apply the BLS procedure accurately during CPR simulation. According to AHA, preparation and qualification resolution assistance significantly affects success resuscitation and increase the chances of survival. 21 In line with Twohig et al.'s study, reviewing evidence comparing ECPR results with conventional CPR (CCPR), before examining resuscitation-specific parameters to assess patient. Where are the results ECPR is a sophisticated treatment option that can improve outcomes in certain patient populations in refractory heart attack. 22 Subgroup analysis is suggested that digital resuscitation training may consider using a mixed learning approach with virtual patients, computer screen-based, video-based learning theory and assessment, especially for CPR training among health professionals. 23 In Zhou et al.'s 24 research, the practice of teaching distance using Combined Mode Massive Open Micro-Video Course for student interns in the Department of Emergencies During the Epidemic Period the COVID-19 states the combined mode effect of the MOOC micro-video in emergency nursing practice is the same as the traditional effect teaching method, but higher satisfaction. 24 The critical role of repetitive periodic CPR training courses to ensure that nurses were competent, up to date and confident responders in the event of a cardiac arrest is present strong evidence to support practice of nursing in the emergency life-saving procedure of CPR. 25 @story_separate@Boada et al. 1 109 samples Randomized Learning using the game Life Support Simulation Activities (LISSA) controlled trial which implements 3D virtual games in conducting CPR training was much more interesting and increases student knowledge and efficacy compared to traditional classroom learning. Wong et al. 2 30 samples Randomized controlled trial The study highlighted gaps in current health professionals' CPR education that could be addressed using VR-enabled learning and assessment activities. CPR instructors identified fidelity, engagement, resource conservation, and memory enhancement as features of VR that make it ideal for health profe sionals' CPR education. Virtual reality was viewed by CPR instructors as having potential as a blended learning tool, targeting both 'novice' and 'experienced' health professionals . Moon and Hyun 9 120 samples Randomized controlled trial The CPR blended learning program that integrates video and face-to-face lectures was effective in enhancing the knowledge and attitudes of nursing students. Na et al. 12 2,169 samples Prospective cluster randomized study The small group discussion (SGD) renewal program was more effective than the practice while watching the PWW program in increasing the knowledge and skills in BLS renewal training. Park et al. 13 79 samples Quasi-experimentation Blended E-learning, with self-directed repetitive learning, was more effective in improving nursing competence, self-efficacy, problem solving, and psychomotor skills for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation than conventional practical education. Cheng et al. 14 832 samples Randomized controlled non-inferiority trial Mixed CPR training programs are not inferior to the ones done traditionally in that compression depth was the primary outcome. While CPR knowledge, practicality, quality of CPR performance, and skills retention were secondary outcomes. Drummond et al. 15  The simulation technique in the procedures for performing CPR is very important in conducting online lessons. Furthermore, learning about the principles and skills of the nursing care plan increases the efficacy, knowledge, attitudes and appropriate clinical experience for nursing students to become competent practitioners. Following the 4.0 technology era and the COVID-19 pandemic all aspects of life need to change by implementing online learning to prevent further spread of the virus.","The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to carry out face-to-face training activities in various higher institutions. This has led to a negative impact on the skills and abilities of nursing students in performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the cessation of their clinical practice programs in hospitals. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the efficacy and knowledge of nursing students in performing CPR by implementing a blended learning program, through online learning platforms. The search for full-text articles was carried out in May 2020 and were reviewed to know whether they fit the theme using the ProQuest, ScienceDirect and PubMed databases with the keywords “BLS”, “CPR”, “Blended learning”, “Knowledge” and “Self-efficacy”. In addition, there were 15 articles that matched the criteria. The application of a blended learning program that integrates video and face-to-face lectures through online learning platforms in conducting effective CPR, increases the efficacy and knowledge of nursing students. The effectiveness of online learning greatly affects the efficacy and knowledge of nursing students in conducting CPR. Therefore, it was highly recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Diagnostic tests are a fundamental component of a successful outbreak containment strategy, being involved at every stage of an outbreak, from initial detection to eventual resolution. 1-3 Development of diagnostic tests suitable for epidemic prevention and containment is technically challenging, and processes for development, validation and implementation are complex and time consuming. The WHO R&D Blueprint for Epidemic Preparedness lists those pathogens thought most likely to cause a future epidemic, 4 but while diagnostic tests exist for the majority, availability is often poor at central laboratory level, and many tests are not available in a format that can be deployed at a community level (table 1) . 5 Poor diagnostic preparedness has contributed to significant delays in the identification of recent outbreaks for multiple pathogens, including Ebola, 2 Lassa fever, 6 yellow fever 7 and Zika, 8 primarily due to poor local diagnostic capacity. In the case of the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, there was a 3-month delay between the index case and the identification of the causative agent; postoutbreak analyses suggest that diagnosing 60% of patients within 1 day instead of 5 days could have reduced the attack rate from 80% to nearly 0%. 2 9 In the end, it was diagnostics BMJ Global Health information coupled with appropriate interventions that led to eventual containment of the outbreak, but the delays resulted in the loss of thousands of lives and billions of dollars in the cost of response. 10 11 While improvements in availability of point-of-care diagnostics and a more rapid set up of laboratory facilities in transmission zones limited the spread of the April 2018 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 12 13 logistical issues with delivery of supplies and shortages of experienced staff persisted. 14 BMJ Global Health Insufficient funding and lack of coordination between donors leading to duplication of effort ► Establish coordinating body for diagnostics funding. ► Match small start-up companies/academia with larger diagnostics or vaccine/pharmaceutical manufacturers with greater capacity. Poor commercial viability of diagnostics during non-outbreak periods ► Provide market incentives for manufacturers and establish sustainable business models to offset losses during non-outbreak years. ► Provide funding for stockpiling of tests. Limited access to samples leading to further delays in diagnostic development ► Establish a specimen sample bank, open to both the diagnostics and vaccines industries, including storage locations and processes for access. Limited collaboration between experts and laboratories with pathogen-specific expertise ► Expand networks of expert personnel and laboratories to allow more rapid responses during outbreaks and maximise knowledge sharing. ► Partner diagnostics and vaccine developers to find novel diagnostic targets. Delays in sharing of diagnostic data affecting response and containment times ► Create connectivity solutions enabling real-time data reporting.@story_separate@► Diagnostics are a fundamental component of successful outbreak containment or control strategies, and each individual pathogen presents specific diagnostic challenges. Current diagnostic landscapes for selected priority pathogens are presented in this supplement. ► Recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika and yellow fever have highlighted overarching barriers to diagnostic preparedness that are common to all outbreak/epidemic situations. ► A holistic, multistakeholder response through healthcare system strengthening, improved market sustainability and integration of diagnostics into existing preparedness mechanisms for vaccines is recommended to address these barriers and create a comprehensive overall epidemic and pandemic preparedness plan. ► Identifying overlaps in diagnostic development needs across different priority pathogens is recommended over a pathogen by pathogen approach to allow more timely and cost-effective use of resources. Diagnostics are fundamental for successful outbreak containment. In this supplement, 'Diagnostic preparedness for WHO Blueprint pathogens', we describe specific diagnostic challenges presented by selected priority pathogens most likely to cause future epidemics. Some challenges to diagnostic preparedness are common to all outbreak situations, as highlighted by recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika and yellow fever. In this article, we review these overarching challenges and explore potential solutions. Challenges include fragmented and unreliable funding pathways, limited access to specimens and reagents, inadequate diagnostic testing capacity at both national and community levels of healthcare and lack of incentives for companies to develop and manufacture diagnostics for priority pathogens during non-outbreak periods. Addressing these challenges in an efficient and effective way will require multiple stakeholders-public and private-coordinated in implementing a holistic approach to diagnostics preparedness. All require strengthening of healthcare system diagnostic capacity (including surveillance and education of healthcare workers), establishment of sustainable financing and market strategies and integration of diagnostics with existing mechanisms. Identifying overlaps in diagnostic development needs across different priority pathogens would allow more timely and cost-effective use of resources than a pathogen by pathogen approach; target product profiles for diagnostics should be refined accordingly. We recommend the establishment of a global forum to bring together representatives from all key stakeholders required for the response to develop a coordinated implementation plan. In addition, we should explore if and how existing mechanisms to address challenges to the vaccines sector, such as Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, could be expanded to cover diagnostics. ► Preselect suppliers to ensure appropriate capacity for outbreak situations. ► Establish manufacturing lines for diagnostic production during outbreaks. Poor diagnostic and surveillance capacity at national level in many countries ► Reinforce surveillance capacities through implementation of surveillance laboratory networks, adapted to specific country needs, or transformation of surveillance laboratories for routine testing. ► Educate healthcare workers on the importance of real-time reporting. ► Link diagnostics and vaccines in a common health programme. ► Adopt a 'One Health' surveillance approach that integrates human, animal and ecological health. It is vital that the current lack of rapid diagnostic tests for priority pathogens is addressed, to ensure that future outbreaks can be more effectively contained. Detailed descriptions of the diagnostic landscapes for selected WHO R&D Blueprint pathogens are provided in this supplement. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Each of these pathogens presents specific challenges, due to differences in factors such as geographical location (Nipah infection primarily occurs in Asia, Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Middle East and Lassa fever in Africa, while Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is widespread) and mode of transmission (MERS-CoV in particular has a significant animal reservoir in dromedary camels, while CCHF is a tick-borne disease), among others. However, there are a common set of barriers to effective deployment and utilisation of diagnostic tests. In this article, we consider these overarching challenges to diagnostic preparedness and offer potential solutions (table 2), looking to existing systems already in place for vaccines preparedness for guidance. Poor diagnostic capacity at national and community levels of healthcare can greatly reduce the effectiveness of outbreak containment, as demonstrated by the recent yellow fever outbreak in Central Africa in 2016-2017. 7 The yellow fever virus is endemic throughout Africa, and an effective vaccine has been available for almost 80 years; nevertheless, the outbreaks in Angola and Nigeria in 2016-2017 were not well prepared for. 20 While detection of yellow fever in serum using ELISA is technically possible at national level, there was a severe shortage of reagents, meaning that laboratories were unable to carry out tests on the majority of suspected cases. 7 Confirmatory antibody neutralisation testing could only be performed at a single central reference laboratory in Senegal (Institut Pasteur, Dakar; the only centre in Africa equipped for this), which can take up to a month, including time required to transport samples and receive testing results. This caused significant delays in recognising the outbreak, hindering the roll-out of the vaccination programme and diminishing the effectiveness of targeted vaccination, resulting in increased spread of disease and longer time to containment. The reagent shortage continued throughout 2016 and the first 8 months of 2017, and by the time the required reagents became available at national level, the disease had spread to multiple states. 7 Improved access to rapid tests to speed up diagnosis of patients presenting to triage tents was badly BMJ Global Health needed. During the Ebola outbreak in early 2018, although availability of point-of-care testing and of testing facilities in transmission zones has been much improved, 12 21 a delay in detection of initial cases and a lack of good epidemiological information has presented difficulties in estimating the true geographical extent and magnitude of the outbreak. 13 The key lesson from these experiences is that diagnostic tests in a format adapted for field use are essential for rapid containment of outbreaks, even in the presence of an effective vaccine. This lack of affordable and definitive diagnostics has been described as one of today's most serious health security blind spots 7 and will be of particular importance for outbreaks that tend to occur in rural locations, such as Lassa fever, and those that primarily affect mobile populations, such as MERS-CoV. 18 19 While general infrastructure strengthening and capacity building is essential and will bring rapid improvements to diagnostic preparedness (see next section), creation of sustainable programmes for disease surveillance in low-income countries can only be achieved through the development of innovative diagnostic technologies that can be made affordable and available. One approach to building sustainable facilities at country level is the development of flexible diagnostic platforms that can rapidly adopt tests for different pathogens. Multipathogen panels are particularly valuable for initial detection and monitoring of outbreak-causing pathogens, allowing rapid response without undue taxing of human resources through diversion of attention from other tasks, additional training requirements or need for implementation of new supply chains. 22 Additionally, diagnostics that require limited sample preparation would reduce training needs and minimise the risk to laboratory workers, and so would be particularly advantageous for pathogens that are easily transmittable and/or cause severe disease. Indeed, the delay between the index case and the identification of Ebola as the causative agent during the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic was partially due to a lack of appropriate highlevel containment facilities at the lower levels of healthcare, meaning that samples had to be sent to a central laboratory. 2 The provision of funding for the development of critical pathogen-specific assays that can be employed in a decentralised setting is essential to address the current gap in diagnostic epidemic and pandemic preparedness. However, funding must be sufficient, and its allocation must be strategic and coordinated. During the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic, substantial public funding (approximately US$ 435 million) was made available from various governmental, public and philanthropic sources, 23 but this was distributed across multiple recipients, many of them small start-up companies, through a series of relatively small 'panic grants'. 2 Of these 70 companies, few were capable of success. They often lacked the resources and infrastructure to complete product development as well as the manufacturing and distribution capacity to meet demand had they received product approval. Although seven companies eventually earned WHO Emergency Use Assessment and Listing approval 24 and 11 earned US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization approval for their tests, 25 the delays and inefficiencies introduced by the fragmented funding process demonstrates a need for improved coordination for future outbreaks and the importance of ensuring that funding is allocated to companies with sufficient capability and resources. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is an alliance that raises and coordinates funding for development of vaccines for epidemic-causing pathogens; leveraging a similar mechanism for diagnostics would help to prevent the issues seen during the Ebola epidemic. Coordination between funding recipients as well as donors would also be beneficial, for example, matching up a smaller set of start-up companies or academic bodies with relevant expertise to larger manufacturers with greater capacity and resources would ensure more efficient use of funding and technical synergies to accelerate the diagnostic research and development pathway to market. The commercial viability of diagnostics during non-outbreak periods is another important issue that needs to be addressed, as a lack of market incentives as outbreaks decline discourages companies from continuing development and commercialisation. Of the companies that participated in diagnostic development during the recent Zika epidemic, the majority are no longer continuing research now that the outbreak is over. Innovative financing solutions, including sustainable market commitments, pooled procurement mechanisms and funding for stockpiling of tests, must be put in place to establish a sustainable supply chain and support long-term commitments from manufacturers by offsetting currently unsustainable losses during non-outbreak years. Notably, mechanisms are already in place to address some of these challenges in the vaccines sector, for example, processes established by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, have proven highly effective in ensuring supply of vaccines during outbreaks; similar mechanisms should be explored and tailored to the diagnostics market. 26 In addition to the lack of coordinated funding, research and development of diagnostic tests for recent outbreaks has been hampered by insufficient access to well-characterised, good quality, validated specimens. 2 27 28 During the Zika outbreak in South America and the USA in 2015-2016, despite requests for diagnostics from affected countries, poor access to samples and other reference materials, in part due to export restrictions, greatly delayed the development of diagnostic tools. 29 This delay in turn prevented timely and accurate Zika case confirmation and delayed generation of the scientific evidence needed to confirm the suspected relationship between the increase in severe neurological complications and Zika infections. Diagnostics developers had to purchase specimens without guarantee of the quality of the clinical characterisation (which is of particular importance for the Zika virus due to the high immunological cross-reactivity with dengue virus and other flaviviruses). 30 Efforts to validate BMJ Global Health diagnostic tests for the WHO R&D Blueprint pathogens CCHF and MERS-CoV have also been hampered by difficulties with sourcing of clinical specimens, as described elsewhere in this supplement. 15 18 The establishment of a specimen sample bank, in the form of an online sample repository, would help to ensure that development for future outbreaks proceeds in a more timely and transparent manner and would allow for quality guarantees. In addition to providing information on specimens collected, ideally, this repository would also include storage locations and processes for access. A shared system open to both diagnostics and vaccines industries would ensure optimum efficiency. An example of an effective sample sharing initiative is the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework, founded by WHO after the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which establishes sharing agreements with industry partners involved in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, whereby WHO provides strain samples and industry stakeholders commit to provision of vaccines and diagnostics. 31 Effective collaboration and communication between experts and laboratories with pathogen-specific expertise is also essential to the rapid development of diagnostic tests. During the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009-2010, existing networks of subject matter experts and expert laboratories, established for the purposes of seasonal influenza surveillance, were able to quickly respond to the outbreak, enabling early detection of the emergent strain, 32 rapid implementation of containment measures and adaptation of existing surveillance programme to monitor spread. Diagnostic expertise was particularly important in this case, as the pandemic strain had to be detected against a background of other circulating influenza A strains and other respiratory viruses causing influenza-like illness. 32 The influenza example demonstrates the positive impact that collaboration between global and national stakeholders and industry can have on the speed and effectiveness of response. Similar networks of diagnostic experts and laboratories for other relevant pathogens that can be activated in the event of an outbreak would greatly improve research and development times. Both academic and private sector stakeholders would be included with a focus on maximising knowledge sharing and accelerating innovation, in an environment that encourages collaboration rather than competition between developers. Partnering with vaccine developers to find novel diagnostic targets is also strongly recommended, as vaccine developers must conduct extensive research into the immune response to pathogens. An example of how effective this could be is provided by the rk39 ELISA test for detection of visceral leishmaniasis, which was developed by the Infectious Disease Research Institute in Seattle as a by-product of their vaccine research. 33 Improvements in the sharing of diagnostic data would greatly improve the diagnostic response to outbreaks. During the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic, delays in sharing of diagnostic data affected containment times. Variations in reporting practices, non-governmental organisations keeping data private, long delays in release of data from academic institutions and a failure to link West Africa's surveillance to international systems all led to data fragmentation and inconsistencies that impacted the effectiveness of the containment response. 34 Some improvements were seen during the Zika outbreak, with an agreement among journal editors to allow rapid publication of outbreak data. 35 In addition to this, linking diagnostic tests with communications technology enabling real-time data reporting and transmission of geo-tagged test results to national and international health information systems would facilitate improved tracking and mapping of geographical patterns, allowing for faster response and containment as well as improved supply chain management. In cases where diagnostics have not been developed in advance of an outbreak, the Ebola and Zika experiences highlight the importance of ensuring that the development process is condensed as much as possible. During the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic, utilisation of processes for emergency use authorisation of diagnostic devices allowed development and approval of new platforms to be accelerated, with several new diagnostics gaining authorisation for use in detection of the pandemic strain (the majority of these were reverse transcriptase PCR based). 32 36 The availability of these assays provided substantial surge capacity, and as some were designed for use on existing platforms, expenses for laboratories already equipped with these platforms were minimised. 36 Expedited regulatory approval processes are therefore important to enable diagnostic tests to be brought into use as rapidly as possible after the initial development stage. However, mechanisms to approve such tests for routine use after declarations of public emergency have been closed are lacking, particularly as emergency use approvals can be granted based on sparse data. logistical challenges and healthcare system preparedness As discussed above, the recent yellow fever and Ebola outbreaks underline the impact of interruptions in supply on time to containment. 2 7 To prepare for future outbreaks, it will be important to ensure that sufficient manufacturing capacity for diagnostic tests is in place. Preselection of suppliers to manufacture diagnostic tests for priority pathogens would ensure that companies that already have appropriate manufacturing capacity are enlisted to supply diagnostics during an outbreak scenario, but additional investment in manufacturing will be essential to allow urgent demands to be met without negative impact on other business commitments. Establishment of manufacturing lines specifically for the production of diagnostics for current outbreaks would help to guarantee sufficient supply and would offset costs for manufacturers who would otherwise need to stop BMJ Global Health production of other higher income-generating products to respond to a global health emergency. These manufacturing lines could be funded, for example, by a number of government donors; an overarching decision-making board to manage investments and prioritise products for manufacture would of course be required. Overall strengthening of the diagnostic capacity of laboratories at national levels is important for any preparedness strategy. Reinforcement of surveillance capacity of weaker healthcare systems, including education of healthcare workers and implementation of surveillance laboratory networks, is critical to allow earlier identification of outbreaks and more effective isolation of cases. The influenza pandemic of 2009-2010 shows how effective a robust global surveillance network can be 32 ; in particular, the mentoring system that was employed to provide support for countries with lower technical abilities from those with stronger diagnostic capacity was a successful measure that could be implemented for other pathogens. In contrast, the recent yellow fever and Zika outbreaks clearly demonstrate the negative impact of poor surveillance. 7 8 The absence of a specific marker for Zika surveillance was largely responsible for the wide spread of the disease, as without surveillance information, effective control measures could not be put in place. 8 The disconnect between surveillance findings and provision of vaccines negatively impacted the containment response to the yellow fever outbreak. 7 Ensuring that national-level laboratories are equipped to test for a wide range of diseases and that they work in interconnected diagnostic networks would significantly improve epidemic containment times, and the ability to transform surveillance laboratories for routine testing in outbreak situations would also relieve pressure on testing centres. Linking diagnostics and vaccines in a common health programme would help to ensure that vaccines are delivered in a timely manner to the most at-risk populations. For pathogens with significant animal reservoirs, such as the Nipah and CCHF viruses, collection and integration of animal surveillance data may also be a necessary component of any outbreak preparedness strategy. 15 17 A 'One Health' approach to surveillance that integrates human, animal and ecological health would provide earlier opportunities for outbreak detection and prevention; however, a number of challenges to implementing such an approach exist, including need for greater cross-sectoral communication, strengthening of laboratory networks, restructuring of existing systems, and development of shared databases, shortage of experienced personnel and limited availability of diagnostic tests suitable for animal use. 37 nexT STepS: ImplemenTIng THe propoSed SoluTIonS Taking a holistic approach to diagnostic preparedness will require a multistakeholder response. The first step may be the assembly of the multiple key stakeholders in this field to convene a global diagnostics forum. Bringing together all relevant parties, including industry (both diagnostics and vaccines, and large and start-up companies), WHO, other healthcare bodies such as the Unicef, Gavi and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), governments and subject matter experts, will allow for more efficient and productive discussions to determine the right solutions and how best to implement them, and could inform the development of new target product profiles that align with this comprehensive approach. This global forum approach has been commonly used in the vaccines sector in isolation (meetings of the CEPI forum and Joint Coordination Group are key examples), but no such meeting for diagnostics or the combination of diagnostics and vaccines has taken place. Beyond enabling a multistakeholder engagement plan, there may be opportunities to leverage mechanisms in place to help address outbreak preparedness challenges in vaccines. Expanding these mechanisms to include diagnostics would be more efficient, making use of existing expertise and processes, and would allow for a more integrated approach to outbreak preparedness linking both diagnostics and vaccines, which are inherently connected. CEPI could act as a bridge between diagnostics needs and vaccine preparedness for research and development, and Gavi could dedicate resource to help generate market predictability. In fact, Gavi is already exploring how to best use its resources to enable more effective vaccine campaigns for yellow fever outbreaks through support of diagnostics. Moreover, FIND is already working with CEPI to ensure that diagnostics that can generate reliable surveillance data are available for priority pathogens including Lassa fever, Nipah, CCHF and Ebola, which will lead to accelerated vaccine development, evaluation and implementation. An exploration of lessons learnt from both of these experiences would be an appropriate topic for the first global forum.@story_separate@Recent outbreaks of pathogens such as Ebola, Lassa fever, yellow fever and Zika viruses have been exacerbated by the lack of accessible diagnostic tests, leading to poor detection and surveillance, ultimately delaying the time to containment. While each pathogen presents specific challenges, several common themes have emerged from these cases that are applicable to all outbreak situations. In order to achieve a state of preparedness for future outbreaks of these pathogens, and of other potential epidemic-causing pathogens such as those listed in the WHO R&D Blueprint, there is an urgent need for overall strengthening of the diagnostic capacity of healthcare systems, and for financial and technical support mechanisms to be put in place to enable the timely development of innovative tests and to guarantee market sustainability. Funding should be prioritised to ensure that there is adequate investment in systems strengthening, since this will provide greater value for money in terms of overall BMJ Global Health outbreak preparedness than focusing on individual pathogens. Similarly, target product profiles for new priority pathogen diagnostics should take these needs into consideration to ensure that maximum benefits to overall outbreak preparedness are derived from any new developments in the diagnostics field. In conclusion, the importance of diagnostics in epidemic preparedness cannot be underestimated. Integration of diagnostics into existing preparedness systems and overall strengthening of healthcare system diagnostic capacity will lead to more rapid containment of future outbreaks, with the potential to save many lives and substantially reduce the healthcare burden.","Diagnostics are fundamental for successful outbreak containment.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an acute catalyst for an exponential rise in the use of video consultations, with remote consultations currently used as the default mode of communication with patients, wherever possible, to reduce the risk of virus transmission [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . These elevated rates of remote consultation will almost certainly continue after the return to more 'normal' healthcare provision [7, 8] . Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that the recently increased quantity of remote consultations does not necessarily mean that clinicians are now fully equipped to offer their patients high-quality remote consultations. Concerns regarding video consultation have been well documented, particularly pertaining to cost effectiveness, impacts on health outcomes and whether such technology serves a diverse case mix [9] [10] [11] [12] . Since COVID-19 has forced this technology into wider use, guidance has been issued to healthcare practitioners around the world to facilitate the decision making process around provision of remote treatment [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . This guidance centres on ensuring that patients with complex needs have the capacity to engage with consultation, that the consulting practitioner has all the necessary information to hand and that secure and reliable prescribing systems are in place. Such guidance is clearly essential in the short term, while doctors familiarise themselves with the basics of remote consultation. However, in the longer term it will also be crucial to ensure that future clinicians are formally trained to conduct high-quality video consultations. Newly graduated doctors are expected to be able to communicate effectively with patients, whether when providing care in person or remotely [18] . Nevertheless, at present, the teaching of video consultation skills is far from mainstream [19] . It is therefore of utmost importance that this topic is introduced to the undergraduate curriculum so that those offering future video consultations are trained to provide safe and effective patient care which adheres to national guidelines. While clinical and practical aspects of the delivery of telemedicine have a stronger presence in the literature, education on delivery of video consultation is minimally represented. Prior to the pandemic only half of American medical schools included telemedicine in their curriculum [20] and since the pandemic there remains a gap in the literature in this area [21] . A single published systematic review from 2017 found only nine studies (published 2008-2014) relating to education and training in 'clinical telehealth' [22] , many of which did not cover video consultation specifically in their training sessions. Where publications describe specific video consultation skills teaching, results have largely been positive [23, 24] , although samples are typically small and it is difficult to determine the longer-term impact of the teaching. One pilot study reported that, in the absence of prior training, graduate medical trainees perform poorly on simple assessment and management tasks via video consultation technology [25] . This suggests that training in video consultation is essential prior to use in a clinical environment. In the words of one narrative review, 'medical education has a responsibility to ensure that physicians are prepared to effectively leverage the power of technology to serve their patients' [26] . This has never been more relevant than at present, where the use of technology to assist in the delivery of patient care is rapidly increasing. There is an urgent need for further integration of such an important topic into mainstream medical education [20, 22] . We therefore sought to add video consultation skills to the undergraduate medical curriculum at our university. To this end, we have developed a teaching programme in skills specific to video consultation. The current paper describes the development and piloting of this teaching programme, in preparation for a large-scale multi-site study across UK medical schools.@story_separate@'Plan, Do, Study, Act' (PDSA) quality improvement methodology with a pre-post study design was used to introduce the proposed curriculum changes in a structured and measured way [27] . PDSA was initially outlined in 2009 [27] and focusses on a model for improvement with a cyclical nature: define the objective (plan), carry out the plan (do), analyse the data and summarise the learning (study) and, finally, decide what changes are needed in order to plan the next cycle. A process map for the project is shown in Figure 1 . Local ethics committee formal exemption from ethical approval was received due to the quality improvement nature of this project. The video consultation software [28] used during the teaching session is compliant with GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 [29] . Students had no access to real video consultations and simulated consultations were not recorded. All evaluation forms were completed anonymously and stored securely. Key stakeholders for this project were identified using the '9 Cs' method (commissioners, customers, collaborators, contributors, channels, commentators, consumers, champions, competitors) [30] . Clinicians who currently carry out remote consultations were considered a key stakeholder group, since today's medical students should be ready to assume such roles in the future. Two local clinicians (consultants in Diabetes/Endocrinology and Gastroenterology) who regularly use the video consultation software NHS Near Me were interviewed by the first author (CKG). These semi-structured interviews followed a topic guide; detailed notes were taken by the interviewer (guide and interview notes available on request). Interview responses informed the design of an online survey to enable data collection from a wider sample of clinicians with experience of conducting video consultations. The 17-item survey was subsequently distributed to all clinician users of NHS Near Me registered within our organisation (n = 332) in mid-2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey responses were returned by 45 clinicians (13.5% response rate); 4 responses were excluded due to lack of use of video consultation. The largest group of respondents was medical or surgical consultants (41.5%) followed by specialist nurses (19.5%). 53.7% had been using video consultations for under a year, 14.6% each for 1-2 years, 2-5 years and 5-10 years and a single clinician (2.4%) for longer than 10 years. Median clinician estimate of outpatient workload carried out by video at the time was 8% (range 1-40%). 31.5% of users reported receiving some form of training in skills specific to remote consultation, all at postgraduate level. Those who did receive training mainly learnt about the technical setup (36%) either informally or at an induction from NHS Near Me. Consistent with the published literature [22, 24, 31] , respondents suggested the use of simulation as one of the best ways to introduce video consultation to students and qualified professionals alike. Suggestions for topics to cover in a teaching session included patient selection, confidentiality, support mechanisms for the patient and practical aspects of technical equipment. Communication skills, specifically clear speech, awareness of body language over video, putting patients at ease, verbalising clear management plans, checking of patient understanding and techniques to bring a video consultation to a close were also recommended by respondents. One respondent suggested playing a recording of an exemplar video consult to form the basis of a discussion of the above points, which has been shown to be effective in the literature [23] . Seven key areas were identified from the published literature and stakeholder consultation as important focus points for an intervention. These formed the learning outcomes (Textbox 1), which were designed according to Bloom's principles which comprise a hierarchical model designed to classify educational learning objectives [32] . These provided a framework around which the educational intervention was carefully designed. An active learning approach was taken, as this aligned well with the proposed learning outcomes and has been shown to increase student performance, particularly in small group settings with fewer than 50 learners [33] . Final year medical students were chosen as the recipient learners since their schedules place them in clinical practice for longer periods of time than other year groups, increasing their chances of encountering video consultation in practice and thus the perceived relevance of the teaching on their future careers. For the first iteration of the PDSA cycle, the intervention was designed as a single 2 hour teaching session for around 20 students, comprising a short introduction for the entire group, maximising the height of attention in group teaching during the first 10-20 minutes [34] , followed by a carousel of three teaching stations, using a similar structure to that published by Rienits et al [23] . The session was slightly adjusted for its second iteration based on the evaluation findings; it was lengthened to 2 ½ hours and the rotating carousel condensed into two stations without altering content. An overview of the teaching session structure is shown in Figure 2 . Introduction to video consultation (20 minutes) • Definitions of common alternative terms such as telehealth and remote consultation • A brief history of its use in healthcare • Interactive discussion of its advantages and disadvantages The group then rotated round three interactive teaching stations, each lasting 30 minutes, facilitated by a member of teaching staff (referred to henceforth as a 'facilitator') with experience of video consultation. The three stations were: Technology and example consultations* • Practical session looking at the setup of a video consultation using NHS Near Me video consultation software [28] including an appropriate backdrop, lighting, sound and camera position • Discussion of the structure of a consultation and how this differs when using video compared to face-to-face • Example videos of two video consultations, filmed with actors, one 'good' and one 'bad'. These were made based on the guidelines and stages 1 and 2 of the study. They were used as a way to illustrate the principles covered in the teaching session and carefully scripted to do so. These example videos can be accessed online via the links in the supplemental material Simulation* • Use of a simulated patient to allow students to take a history or discuss a management plan using NHS Near Me video consultation software [28] • Students also given the opportunity to 'be' the patient to appreciate the differences of a consultation from both sides when using video Patient selection and ethical issues • Selection of mock patient summaries for students to group according to suitability for video consultation • Facilitated discussion of potential algorithms to assist in patient selection • Discussion of potential ethical issues around the use of video consultation, including issues surrounding data storage and confidentiality • Discussion and examples of protocols for video consultation, including when things go wrong • Discussion of consent process for video consultation *combined into a single teaching station for the second iteration The pilot teaching session was carried out on two separate occasions with all teaching delivered inperson, with the exception of the simulated video consultation which was carried out using a remotely located volunteer patient. In line with quality improvement methodology using the PDSA cycle, students' baseline knowledge was measured [35] . Prior to the start of the session, students completed a self-report questionnaire, rating their confidence on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (extremely confident) regarding their ability to fulfil each of the seven learning outcomes (questionnaire available in supplemental materials). The same questions were asked again at the end of the session. Pre-and post-session self-reported confidence scores across the seven learning outcomes were compared using paired sample t-tests. In addition, students were asked the level (1-5, strongly disagree -strongly agree) to which they agreed with a series of statements relating to the relevance and quality of each of the three stations of the teaching session. While this was not a pre-validated questionnaire, it was carefully designed based on the four dimensions of target parameters described by Gibson et al in their validated, structured approach to evaluation of teaching [36] : structural, procedural, teacher characteristics and outcome of teaching activities. There is significant overlap between these four domains and the nine domains described by Marsh in the widely used Students' Evaluations of Educational Quality (SEEQ) [37] . Facilitators were also asked to complete evaluation forms asking six open questions about their experience of facilitating the sessionfor example, how the session could be improved and suggestions for other areas to be covered in the teaching session in the future. Planning is currently underway for a multi-site study with recruitment of medical schools across the UK ongoing. Teaching materials developed during the pilot study have been refined and adjusted to allow online delivery during COVID-19 restrictions and will be distributed to participating centres. Participating centres will collect data on subjective and objective assessment of student knowledge and skills before and after the delivery of video consultation skills teaching, building on methods developed during this pilot study. Two face-to-face teaching sessions were provided to a total of 40 final year medical students. 34 students completed evaluation forms. Subjective feedback was unanimously positive. All students perceived an increase in their confidence at fulfilling the learning outcomes following the session, when compared to pre-session self-rating scores, an effect that was statistically significant (p < 0.001) across all learning outcomes (see Table 1 ). A summary of pre-and post-teaching responses is shown in Table 1 . Before the start of the teaching session, student confidence was similar for each of the learning objectives, with a mean score of 2.39 (out of 5) across learning objectives. Students felt least confident describing the consent process for video consultation and most confident defining video consultation and other commonly used terms. By the end of the session, mean scores for all learning objectives had increased substantially (mean across learning objectives 4.18). No student had a fall in confidence in any area at the end of the session. The greatest score increase was seen in the area rated as least confident prior to the session -the consent process for video consultation. The lowest increase in confidence was in ethical issues surrounding video consultation. All areas of the teaching were felt to be relevant, interactive and led by enthusiastic facilitators. Areas of commendation included the interactive nature of the session, the relaxed environment and the interest of what was perceived to be a relevant subject that had not been touched on before in the students' education. Numerical student feedback for each individual station was fairly homogenous with all stations scoring over 4.5 out of 5 for each statement. Areas for improvement from the students suggested after the first iteration focussed on timing and provision of simulation; these changes were adjusted for the second iteration. Facilitator evaluation mirrored that of the students; they liked the interactive design of the session, commenting that the mixture of topics and practical elements worked well and that this was a muchneeded addition to the curriculum. Their suggestions for improvement also reflected those of the students, focussing on more time for simulation to allow more students to be directly involved. This project was undertaken prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, as video consultation was becoming an increasingly used method of communicating with patients in our rural area. However, the advent of the pandemic has caused a surge in the use of video consultation and therefore the relevance of this pilot study. We developed a novel teaching session to increase final year medical student's skills and knowledge regarding video consultation, targeting an important gap in the curriculum and aligning student learning with national guidelines. Analysis of completed student and facilitator evaluation forms showed positive results, with all agreeing that the session was of benefit. There are, however, several areas that can be improved upon and these formed the focus of the 'study' and 'act' parts of PDSA. Student confidence scores increased by the largest margin when referring to the consent process for video consultation. The topic of consent relating to video consultation featured in each of the three small group sessions; this may have allowed consolidation of knowledge through repetition, often historically cited as an essential part of associative learning [38, 39] . The smallest increase in student confidence was in ethical issues surrounding video consultation. This was covered in the same small group session as patient selection. Feedback from the facilitator suggested that the balance of time allocation was weighted too heavily towards patient selection, resulting in only brief discussion of ethical issues which may explain these results. This will be adjusted for the next iteration of the session. Lack of time is mentioned repeatedly in the feedback, largely relating to the simulation session. The design of this small-group session allowed three students to take part in the simulation, however, with group sizes averaging 7 students, this left more than half the group merely observing. Following discussion with facilitators, some solutions have been identified: firstly, the entire teaching session could be made slightly longer to allow a little more time in each of the three small-group rotations. Alternatively, the role of the patient could be played by a student, allowing more students to have a role in simulation. However, the value of volunteer patients in the education of medical students is well documented [40] and it would seem counterproductive to lose this. Simulation scenarios could also be sub-divided, and students substituted in, or more time allocated to the simulation aspect to allow addition of a third simulation scenario. There were some logistical challenges to running this session, mainly involving the number of rooms required to accommodate each breakout session. The advent of social distancing in the COVID era has prompted the adaptation of the teaching session for online delivery for the next iteration of the project, providing a solution to this issue. Online 'breakout rooms' are widely available on video conferencing software which may in turn allow more students to take an active role in the simulation element of the session, provided sufficient numbers of volunteer patients are trained and available to participate. Continuing to follow a plan consistent with Quality Improvement methodology, the next step is to spread the intervention to other sites, described by Massoud et al [41] as 'an often forgotten stage in an improvement plan'. A nationwide scale-up of this project is currently underway, with recruitment from medical schools across the UK ongoing. Building on this pilot project, the next phase will include baseline and post-teaching objective data collection for all participating students. Objective evidence of improvement is lacking from this pilot project. The original study protocol did include a video consultation question in an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) before and after the teaching session. An existing history taking OSCE station was adapted to be used in a simulated video consultation, with specific marks available for video consultation specific skills. However, due to a Wi-Fi malfunction, the volume of objective data gathered following the teaching session was too small to be meaningful and has hence been excluded from this project summary. The next iteration of the project will include an online pre-and post-teaching objective assessment using a mock video consultation. Numbers studied in this pilot project are low; while statistical significance was reached, these results should be interpreted with this in mind. Moreover, this study was carried out in a UK institution. With adaptation, however, we feel the contents are highly relevant for healthcare settings around the world using video consultation. There are well documented arguments surrounding the use of Likert scales [42] . Within the limits of time and feasibility for the scale of this project it was felt that Likert scales were the most appropriate measure to use for data collection in this case. • Video consultation skills are now a requirement for all graduating medical students • Education and training in video consultation skills is not currently prominent in undergraduate medical education • We have developed a teaching module aiming to improve knowledge and skills of medical students in video consultation • Our pilot data suggests that this teaching was well received and achieved its primary objectives • Further work is ongoing with UK medical schools to disseminate this teaching on a national scale No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s). Charlotte K. Gunner http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5697-6908@story_separate@The aim of the project was 'to increase knowledge and skills relating to video consultation in final year medical students' and was undertaken as a quality improvement project, using the PDSA methodology. This study addressed a significant gap in the literature relating to education in video consultation: there remain very few papers specifically addressing the education of healthcare professionals in skills specific to video consultation. The current lack of published studies leaves a shortfall between the published guidelines on remote consultation and the foundations on which education is built to meet such guidelines. In order to bridge this gap and fulfil the project aims, we combined literature review, stakeholder consultation and a firm foundation in education theory to develop high-quality educational materials suitable for use with undergraduate medical students. The subjective evidence from this pilot project suggests that this aim was achieved, in the shortterm at least. The use of quality improvement methodology, although not often used in medical education, proved a useful structure for such a project. Further subjective and objective evidence will be gathered from an ongoing UK-wide project based on this initial pilot.","BACKGROUND: Video consultations are increasingly used to communicate with patients, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, training in video consultation skills receives scant attention in the literature. We sought to introduce this important topic to our undergraduate medical school curriculum. OBJECTIVE: To increase final year medical students’ video consultation skills and knowledge. METHODS: We used Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) quality improvement methodology with a pre-post study design to develop a teaching session for 5th year medical students, informed by a literature review and online clinician survey. The 2 hour session comprised an introduction and three practical stations: patient selection and ethics, technology and example videos, and simulation. Subjective pre- and post-session confidence was reported by students across seven domains using 5-point scales (1: not at all confident; 5: extremely confident). Students and facilitators completed post-session feedback forms. RESULTS: The 40 students and 3 facilitators who attended, over two separate teaching sessions, provided unanimously positive feedback. All students considered the session relevant. Subjective confidence ratings (n = 34) significantly increased from pre- to post-session (mean increase 1.78, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The inaugural teaching session was well-received and subjective assessment measures showed improvement in taught skills. This pilot has informed a UK-wide multi-centre study with subjective and objective data collection."
"The intriguing connection between gravitational dynamics explored on the black hole horizon and classical thermodynamics was laid bare in the seventies following the work of Bekenstein, Hawking and others [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] (for a review see [6] [7] [8] ). This led to the development of the famous black hole mechanics which are a set of intricate equivalences. For every law of black hole mechanics, there exists a corresponding law of classical thermodynamics, thus allowing the black hole to be considered as a thermodynamic object. However these connections can very well be equivalently established not just only for black hole horizons, but rather on any arbitrary null hypersurface. This allows the attribution of thermodynamical quantities like temperature, entropy etc for any null surface [9] 1 . It has been shown in literature, that certain projections of the Ricci tensor R ab onto a generic null hypersurface H and along the corresponding auxiliary null vector assume physical and/or geometrical interpretations. These relevant projections are R ab l a l b , R ab l a k b and R ab l a q b c (a related discussion can be followed from Section 3 of [12] , see also [13] ). Here l a represents the null generators of H and k a the auxiliary null vector field on H. The induced metric onto S t , where S t represents the two dimensional spacelike transverse submanifold of H is given by q b c (these notations will be cleared in the next section). Below we first mention the existing discussion of these in order to motivate to our goal. Damour [14] (in the context of a black hole event horizon in Einstein gravity) showed that the particular projection, R ab l a q b c , on S t leads to the Damour Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation which is structurally quite similar to the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation. However, the DNS equation can as well be obtained for any generic null hypersurface H in the spacetime [15] [16] [17] (see Eq. (6.14) of [15] for an excellent review). The DNS equation is an evolution equation that relates the Lie derivative (along l a ) of the Hajicek one form with R ab l a q b c . The Hajicek one form is a purely geometric quantity defined on S t . On the other hand R ab l a l b leads to the Null Raychaudhuri (NRC) equation [18] . The NRC equation is a purely geometrical relation which relates the evolution of θ (l) (the expansion scalar of l a field) along the null generators l a with R ab l a l b . The NRC equation was used as a crucial input by Jacobson to derive the Einstein field equations from the Clausius identity δS = δQ T , applied on the local Rindler horizons [19] . The Rindler horizons are assumed to be at thermodynamic equilibrium and δQ represents the matter energy flux traversing across the causal horizon which results in the change of entropy δS (known as Clausius entropy) associated with the horizon. The equilibrium condition requires the crucial restrictive assumption of the vanishing of the second fundamental form and the shear tensor on the null horizon. It is postulated that δS is proportional to the area change of the horizon. The above formalism was extended to the non equilibrium case, in the regime of which, the shear tensor and the expansion scalar on the null surface cannot be set to zero [20] [21] [22] . Gravitational equations for certain modified theories of gravity were also obtained from such similar thermodynamic considerations [21] . Later this concept of Clausius entropy was extended to arbitrary bifurcate null surface [23] and the Einstein equations were also derived for stretched light cone [24] . Moreover, Jacobson [25] derived the Einstein field equations as applied to local causal diamonds (constructed at any point in the spacetime) by extremizing the total entanglement entropy of the null horizon and the matter inside of it. Now we concentrate on R ab l a k b . It was shown by Padmanabhan and his collaborators [12, 26, 27 ] that a certain projection of the Einstein equation (specifically G ab l a k b and hence R ab l a k b ) yields a thermodynamic interpretation which is structurally similar to the first law of thermodynamics. The main difference between Padmanabhan's [12, 26, 27] and Jacobson's [19] approaches in order to relate thermodynamics is the choice of the component of the Einstein equation. For Jacobson, the relevant projection component is R ab l a l b , whereas for Padmanabhan, the choice is R ab l a k b . In fact, it is pointed out in [12] that the neater component to consider is R ab l a k b which produces the thermodynamic identity without any restrictive assumptions like the vanishing of the second fundamental form and the shear tensor on H (which was a crucial assumption in Jacobson's approach). The argument behind this is R ab l a k b picks out the component of R ab l a along l a , the null generators which are intrinsic to the null surface H. Whereas the other one corresponds to that of R ab l a along k a (see section 3 of [12] for more details). Padmanabhan's approach has been generalized to the case of Lanczos-Lovelock theories of gravity [28] [29] [30] as well. However the existing physical interpretations of R ab l a l b and R ab l a k b , so far, have been made explicit via the specific gravitational equation of motion. Moreover, in the latter case the same has been done for a generic null hypersurface by invoking the adapted Gaussian null coordinates (GNC) [31] [32] [33] [34] . This makes the identified expression of the thermodynamics entities to be in ""noncovariant"" form. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether in a completely covariant fashion R ab l a l b and R ab l a k b can be provided any physical interpretation, without invoking any specific gravitational dynamics; i.e. solely based on the properties of null surface H. In our analysis, the NRC equation (for both the l a and k a vector fields) is the starting point in providing a physical interpretation for the two concerned projections. We show that the underlying dynamics of the background is not ""explicitly"" necessary to provide such interpretation. Our analysis and results are divided in different sections. In section II we provide a brief overview of the null foliation of the spacetime manifold in the neighbourhood of our generic null hypersurface H, which acts as the building block of the present analysis. In section III, we analyse if R ab l a l b can be provided a physical interpretation. We begin with the NRC equation for l a and then integrate it on the transverse spacelike surface S t . Performance of a virtual displacement along the null generators of H leads to a possibility of thermodynamic identity. We feel that this is not a surprising result at all as NRC equation is being used in search of thermodynamics of horizon and therefore it possesses such an inherent structure. Still we present this one in order to provide a segue into our main topic of providing a physical interpretation to R ab l a k b in a covariant way. In going through the steps we shall observe few interesting features of the approach which are probably not emphasized in literature. It is noticed that in the special case of a stationary black hole system, the expression of the energy is related to the well known Komar energy E K (please see Chapter 4, page number 149 of [18] ). Moreover the integrated form of the thermodynamic identity leads to a generalised form of Smarr formula [35] which, as given in literature, is of the form E K = 2ST , Here T is the temperature of the horizon (see [36] [37] [38] [39] for discussions related to this identity). Next we concentrate our attention to R ab l a k b in Section IV. Invoking the NRC equation corresponding to k a (the auxiliary null vector field) and integrating it on the transverse space S t and allowing for the virtual displacement along k a , we arrive at a thermodynamic interpretation of R ab l a k b which is structurally equivalent to the first law of thermodynamics. The null foliation (though non-unique) of the spacetime manifold allows us to have a completely covariant expression of the energy term. This is because the expression of the energy term contains geometrical quantities defined on the null surface H. These geometrical quantities once defined on H will be independent of the foliation chosen. Here we provide our definition of the ""geometrical work function"" in order to make way for the thermodynamic identity independent of any theory of gravity. Previously equivalent thermodynamic interpretation (analogous to the first law of thermodynamics) have been provided in the Einstein-Hilbert [12] and Lanczos-Lovelock theory [30] . However there are certain important differences between the work in [12] , [30] and ours. In [12] and [30] , the derivations of the thermodynamic identity have been performed near a generic null hypersurface without any assumed symmetries of the spacetime. However the derivations have been performed with respect to (w.r.t) an adapted null coordinate system constructed in the neighbourhood of the generic null surface H known as the GNC system. One noticeable feature of such a construction is that the expression of the energy is compatible to the GNC metric only. For the GNC construction, the auxiliary null vector field k a is affinely parametrized and hypersurface orthogonal. We in our case however foliate the spacetime in the vicinity of the generic null surface H by a family or stack of null hypersurfaces. Then allowing for the 3 + 1 induced foliation of the family of the null surfaces, we derive exactly the same structural thermodynamic identity in a completely coordinate independent fashion. The reason as to why we are able to achieve this covariantly is mentioned in section II once we introduce the construction of the null foliated spacetime. Our construction dose not require k a to be affinely parametrized and hypersurface orthogonal. Another difference in our approach from that adopted in earlier ones is that our starting point is the NRC equation for k a , whereas no such equation has been explicitly used in these works. It may be pointed out that the work function (or pressure) in [12, 30, 40] has constantly been defined as P = −T ab l a k b i.e owing entirely from the matter energy tensor. The entropy density has then been defined as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy density for the Einstein-Hilbert case [12] and as the the Wald entropy density for the Lanczos-Lovelock models [30] . However in our interpretation, we have identified what we call as the ""geometrical work function"" (or geometrical pressure), entirely from geometrical quantity. In analogy to the entanglement entropy, we call our identified entropy density as the ""entanglement entropy density"" since it depends on the geometry of the relevant surface. Under the umbrella of such an interpretation, we have aimed to provide the thermodynamic identification independent of any theory of gravity. For the reader, we summarize the structural and interpretational difference between the approach in [12, 30] and ours. • The thermodynamic identity in [12, 30] and is brought through the GNC construction while ours is brought about through a 3 + 1 foliation of the null family H Φ . • The expression of the energy in the GNC is solely adapted to these coordinates. On the contrary ours is in covariant form and hence can be applied to any structure of null surface. • In [12, 30] , the pressure or work function has been consistently defined w.r.t the matter energy tensor P = −T ab l a k b , while we define a so called ""geometrical work function"". • The entropy density in [12] is the Bekenstein Hawking entropy density, while it is the Wald entropy density for the Lanczos-Lovelock models [30] . For our interpretation, the entropy density is consistently the entanglement entropy density irrespective of the theory of gravity. Finally we shall conclude in Section V. We use the appendices to show that the covariant expression of the energy we derive entirely matches with the expression of the energy obtained via the GNC system in [12] for the Einstein-Hilbert case. There we also provide outlines of derivations for expressions used in the text. Before proceeding ahead, we state that throughout the paper we have the metric signature (−, +, +, +). We use the natural units with G, and c set to unity. The lowercase Latin indices a,b,.. represent the bulk spacetime indices and run from 0 to 3. The Greek symbol µ run from 1 to 3 and represents the spatial coordinates on a spacelike hypersurface. The transverse coordinates in the spacelike subspace S t orthogonal to l a and k a are represented by the upper case Latin indices A,B,.. and run from 2 to 3.@story_separate@In this section we briefly mention the geometrical setup of the arena where we aim to find the thermodynamical connections. All our analysis will be focused on a generic null hypersurface H in the spacetime manifold (M, g) and we aim to establish thermodynamical laws w.r.t this null surface. For details of the construction, we refer the reader to [15] and hence we provide a brief overview here. Our generic null hypersurface is submanifold in the spacetime such that the induced metric q ab of H is degenerate. The null surface can be defined by the constant value of a scalar field Φ such that the normal one-form to the hypersurface H is defined as, where ρ being a scalar function on null surface. This entails the Frobenius identity and hence is hypersurface orthogonal to H. The null generators l a of this hypersurface satisfy the geodesic equation, where κ is the non-affinity parameter and therefore these are not affinely parametrized. Now we add structure to the null hypersurface H by the auxiliary null foliation in its neighbourhood. The aim of this construction is geared to the fact that we want l a to be defined not just only on H, but rather in its open neighbourhood (in (M, g)). This allows us to define covariant derivative of l a in the entire spacetime, which would not have been the case had we been restricted only on H. The construction proceeds by foliating the spacetime in the neighbourhood of H, by a family of null hypersurfaces parametrized by different (constant) values of the scalar field Φ. Thus the family of the null hypersurfaces foliating the spacetime is denoted by H Φ . Our generic null hypersurface H is then nothing, but a particular member of this set, say H Φ=1 . Then (1) stays valid even in this construction of a family of null hypersurfaces. Therefore ""extends"" the domain of scalar field ρ from the null surface H to its open neighbourhood where the foliation takes place. One important caveat of such a construction is that even though such a foliation H Φ is non-unique, all geometrical quantities are independant of the foliation. That is to say, once a geometrical quantity has been evaluated at H, its remains the same no matter what construction is chosen for H Φ to foliate the open neighbourhood of H. In order to define the projector onto the null surface we require an auxiliary null vector k a satisfying l a k a = −1 and k a k a = 0. Finally we proceed to foliate the null hypersurface H (or the family H Φ ) by spacelike slices in the spirit of 3 + 1 splitting. We consider a family of t = constant spacelike hypersurfaces Σ t (parametrized by t ∈ R) that intersect the family H Φ on 2 dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces S t,Φ ; i.e. S t,Φ := H Φ ∩ Σ t . Then for our concerned hypersurface H, S t surfaces are pre- We now mention the structural differences between the above construction and the GNC adapted (to H) system (a detailed discussion on the construction of GNC can be followed from [31] [32] [33] [34] ). This discussion is important in order to identify the underlying constructional difference in thermodynamic interpretation from the earlier attempts which rely on the structure of GNC. In this construction with the coordinates (u, r, x A ), the generic null hypersurface is stationed at r = 0. The null normal to the hypersurface H is defined as the gradient of the r = constant surfaces i.e l a = ∂ a r and are nonaffinely parametrized satisfying (2) . The auxiliary null vector field k a in the GNC is by construction chosen to be along affinely parametrized null geodesics. That is, we move away from the null surface stationed at r = 0 along the ingoing null geodesic of k a . In the GNC, the auxiliary null vector field k a = −(∂/∂r) a has the affine parameter r and points along the direction of decreasing r (ingoing). It can also be seen that the null geodesic k a is hypersurface orthogonal to the u = constant surfaces i.e k a = −∂ a u. Hence we see that the coordinates adapted to the null surface H at r = 0 are (u, x A ). As a result of this adapted coordinatization (u, r, x A ) of (M, g) in the vicinity of H, the thermodynamic interpretation of R ab l a k b comes explicitly as GNC dependant. However in the construction of the null foliated spacetime introduced above provided with a 3 + 1 foliation, we do not impose any coordinatization. That is, we just demand that the neighbourhood of H Φ=1 is null foliated by a family of hypersurfaces H Φ=c . This null foliated spacetime is then foliated by t = constant spacelike surfaces. That is all what we require for providing R ab l a l b and R ab l a k b a thermodynamic interpretation. This is because as we have mentioned earlier, even though the foliation is non-unique, yet all geometrical quantities relevant to H are independant of the foliation chosen. In fact, if we want, we can ""adapt"" a coordinate system w.r.t to H. A very famous example would be a coordinate system that is ""stationary w.r.t the null hypersurface H"" [15] . For example associated with the spacelike foliation of (M, g) via t = constant surfaces, we can consider a 3 + 1 coordinate system (x a = (t, x µ )). Here t is the coordinate associated with the time development vector t a = ( ∂ ∂t ) a = (1, 0, 0, 0) and x µ are the spacelike coordinates on the t = constant slice. t a can be expressed in terms of the lapse function N and the shift vector b a as, where n a is the timelike unit normal to Σ t . The time development vector basically connects neighbouring slices of Σ t and Σ t+dt with the same spatial coordinates. If in this coordinate system (x a ), the equation of H does not depend on the coordinate t and only involves the spatial coordinates x µ , then (x a ) is a coordinate system that is stationary w.r.t H. This implies that there exists a scalar function ψ(x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) such that say ψ(x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) = 1 defines H. This means that the location of the 2-surface S t is fixed on the t = constant surface ( Σ t with the coordinates x µ = (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 )). It can then be shown [15] that for such a stationary coordinate system x a = (t, x µ ) adapted to H, we have, where (4) is valid only on the null hypersurface. V a then represents the surface velocity of H w.r.t this adapted stationary coordinates. Had we proceeded with finding the physical interpretations of R ab l a l b and R ab l a k b w.r.t to such an adpated coordinate system, then our expressions would turn out to be coordinate dependant. Just like in GNC construction, the generic null surface r = 0 is intersected by the u = constant null surfaces. However these scalar functions are themselves adapted to define the coordinate system in the neighbourhood of H. Adapting any coordinate system w.r.t H would defeat our purpose of providing the interpretations covariantly. We will show in our computations that nowhere do we require the information of the lapse function N and the shift vector b a associated with the 3 + 1 foliation. Nor do we as advertised, require the need of a coordinate system adapted to H. In fact, anticipating one step further, whatever physical interpretation we covariantly attest to R ab l a l b and R ab l a k b should in fact be independent of our null foliated construction itself (since it is non-unique). The interpretation ought to be specific only to the null hypersurface H. In our construction, the auxiliary null vector field need not be along null geodesics as well as hypersurface orthogonal. The auxiliary null vector field in our case is by construction an ingoing normal to the spacelike 2-surfaces S t and hence extends out into the open neighbourhood of H. It can be shown (see [15] for details), that k a satisfies the following relation, where M = e ρ N . The relation (5) shows that k a is not hypersurface orthogonal (as on the right hand side (RHS) l a appears). Hence k a is not the generator of any null hypersurface or in other words, the hyperplane normal to k a is not integrable into a smooth submanifold surface. It can also be shown (see [15] ) that, where Π i a = δ i a + k i l a is the projection tensor onto H along k i . The relation (6) essentially shows that the aux-iliary null vector field k a does not satisfy the geodesic equation. After mentioning the constructional difference we are now aiming to our main goal. This will need several relevant quantities, which we shall list below. The detailed geometric interpretation of them are provided in [15] . The projection tensor onto S t is, The second fundamental form Θ ab of the null surface H and its irreducible decomposition in terms the expansion scalar and the shear tensor corresponding to l a are, (8) The rotation one form ω a satisfies the following relation, The Hajicek 1 form Ω a is basically the projection of the rotation one-form onto S t and is given by, The transversal deformation rate tensor Ξ ab of S t projected on to the tangent plane of (S t ,q) along the auxiliary null vector field k a and its irreducible decomposition into the traceless part (θ (k) ) and the shear tensor (σ (k) ab ) are given by, The covariant derivative defined on S t for any spatial vector v a confined to it is, III. R ab l a l b : A THERMODYNAMIC IDENTITY? The quantity R ab l a l b is best represented by NRC equation for the null vector l a . Usually, NRC equation is being used to explore thermodynamical behaviour of black hole horizon. Both for proving the area increase theorem as well as finding first law of black hole mechanics, this plays a central role. It must be noted that in all these analysis NRC equation came in the middle of the calculation and always applied for Killing vector which is null on the horizon. For instance, see the discussion around Eq. (8.168) to Eq. (8.173) of [41] . Moreover, in Jacobson's analysis [19] this has been used to derive the Einstein's equation of motion from the Clausius relation. Therefore, apparently NRC equation has an inherent thermodynamical structure on the horizon. Although it is not explicitly mentioned in literature, but the way it has been used one can immediately identify this property. In all these earlier analysis, the expressions for thermodynamical entities are taken as input at the very beginning and then finally NRC equation is used to obtain required conclusion. Also, as we mentioned earlier, this is strictly confined to Killing case (or asymptotically Killing). Here we shall take the ""opposite"" route. We will begin with the NRC equation for an arbitrary null vector l a (say), not necessarily a Killing one. Interestingly, the integration of this on the two dimensional subspace on which l a is normal, leads to first law of thermodynamics like structure. This analysis has some noticeable features. First of all, this is valid for any arbitrary null surface and so the results are valid beyond Killing vector field. Secondly, a more general expression of gravitational energy can be obtained. Finally, this thermodynamic structure is the property of the null surface, instead of being related to any associated gravitational theory. Let us now start our calculation. The NRC equation for l a is given by [15, 18]  where l a , satisfying (2), is parametrised by non-affine parameter λ (l) , i.e. l a = dx a /dλ (l) . We now make a virtual displacement of the null hypersurface along its own generators by an amount δλ (l) . Multiplying both sides of equation (13) by the transverse elementary area dA = √ qd 2 x of S t and δλ (l) and then integrating dA only one finds Now since we know that the term on the left hand side (LHS) of (14) can be expressed as follows: In the above we introduced a factor 1/(8πG). Here we have identified T = κ 2π as the temperature of the null surface and is hence related to the non affinity parameter κ of the null generators of the null hypersurface H. We here also identify s = √ q 4G as the entropy density of the null surface. This, in analogy to entanglement entropy, we may interpret as entanglement entropy density (more will be discussed on this analogy in the next section). In the same way, multiplying the RHS of (14) by the numerical factor (1/8πG), the resultant equation can be interpreted as the following thermodynamic identity: where E is the energy associated to the null surface, given by (18) Note that in the whole analysis, we never used Einstein's equations of motion and so the result is very generic to any null surface. The virtual displacement δλ (l) is consistent with any physical process that virtually displaces the 2-surface S t along the null generators itself say from positions λ (l) = 0 to λ (l) = δλ (l) . We can however provide an alternative interpretation to the NRC equation (13) under the process of the virtual displacement δλ (l) . We first multiply both sides of Eq. (13) by the transverse area element of the 2-surface S t together with a multiplicative factor of 1 8πG i.e 1 8πG dA = 1 8πG √ qd 2 x and the virtual displacement δλ (l) . We then integrate the resulting equation over S t , Following Eq. (16), the first term of the LHS can be identified as, where s eq = √ q 4G is the equilibrium entropy density of the null hypersurface. Looking at the second term of the LHS of Eq. (20), we find the integrand contains the well known dissipation term D corresponding to the null hypersurface, The identification of the dissipation term basically comes from the R ab l a q b c component, which results in the DNS equation. The physical interpretation of this viscous dissipation term and its observer dependence has been explored in [16] . Finally, if we identify the variation of the energy under δλ (l) virtual displacement as, we can then identify Eq. (20) as , The second term on the LHS of Eq. (23) is identified as the heat generation part under the virtual displacement δλ (l) process due to irreversible viscous dissipation effects of the null surface H, A very interesting feature of this dissipation term D is that it comprises entirely of geometrical quantities. Hence it can be thought that the irreversible sector of the heat generation basically arises due to gravitational energy fluxes through the null surface. Such an interpretation was previously put forth in [21] . The authors of [21] show via an analogy between the horizon null congruence and a continuous medium that the irreversible heat generation is purely due to gravitational effects. Our expression of the internal heat production (24) for nonaffine generators l a matches with Eq. (47) of [21] for nonaffine Killing vector field approximately generating the Killing horizon, provided we set θ (l) to zero in our case. The authors in [21] constructed a local Rindler wedge in the neighbourhood of a spacetime point P . The Rindler horizon is approximately generated by the Killing vector field χ a which satisfies χ a ∇ a χ b = κχ b . The Killing vector field is tangent to the affinely parametrized null congruence l a of the Rindler horizon. The irreversible part of the heat generation term or uncompensated heat in Eq (47) of [21] contains the norm ||σ||, whereσ ab is the shear tensor corresponding to the Killing congruence. However in our construction, the arbitrary null surface is generated by the non-affinely paramaterized l a field and hence all geometric quantities in our expression (24) of irreversible heat generation pertains to the l a congruence itself. Under such an identification, we have from Eq. , We now carry over this analysis to the special case of a stationary black hole system, for example the Kerr spacetime. In that case, the non affinity parameter κ is independent of the transverse coordinates {x A } and hence can be taken outside the integral in equation (16) . This allows us to interpret equation (17) in the more familiar form of the thermodynamic identity (first law of thermodynamics), where S = A 4G is the entropy of the null hypersurface and hence proportional to its area A. Let us now investigate the expression (18) of the energy E for the stationary black hole case. In this case H is the event horizon of the black hole and l a is the timelike Killing vector which is null on H. Therefore, we denote l a as l a ≡ ξ a = (1, 0, 0, Ω H ) where Ω H is the angular velocity of the black hole. Then, the first term on the RHS of (18) can be evaluated as follows. Integration over λ (l) and since the value of θ (l) vanishes at the stationary point on horizon S t , this term will not contribute. In this case, for the ""quasi static physical process"" the next two terms of RHS can be neglected on S t compared to the other terms (known as equilibrium or near-equilibrium situation [42, 43] ). Therefore the energy expression (18) , for this special case reduces to Also analogously we investigate the second alternative interpretation provided via Eq. (25) , through the introduction of the irreversible part of the heat generation under the ""quasi-static physical process"" for the stationary black hole system. This process actually displaces the 2-surface S t initially at λ (l) = 0 (say) to the position λ (l) = δλ (l) . However for the stationary black hole case, the virtual displacement is through a quasiequilibrium process. That is, initially the 2-surface S t is at equilibrium at λ (l) = 0 and then via a quasi-static process it is displaced to the stationary equilibrium state at λ (l) = δλ (l) . As a result of this quasi-static virtual displacement process the irreversible heat generation δ λ(l) Q ir is basically zero. Under such a process for the stationary black hole, we hence have, The energy expression for the stationary black hole case in this alternative interpretation still remains the same and is given by Eq. (27) . This expression of the energy Eq. (27) known to be proportional to the Komar expression for conserved quantity (see [18] for details on Komar conserved quantity), calculated on the horizon. The volume element on H is dΣ a = −ξ a dλ (l) dA. Also, we can express R ab ξ b as where in the last step Killing equation ∇ a ξ b + ∇ b ξ a = 0 has been used. Note that J ab can be identified as the Noether potential for Einstein gravity. Using all these in (27) one obtains In the last equality, the Stoke's law for integration has been applied. Now the Komar conserved quantity is defined as [18] . Since for stationary background l a = ξ a and ξ a ∇ a κ = 0, we have Therefore integration of (26) yields E = T S and since E = (1/2)E K , in terms of Komar conserved quantity on horizon, one finds This has already been shown in literature [36] [37] [38] [39] We are now in a position to hit the better candidate among the different projections of R ab ; i.e. R ab l a k b (the logic for better choice has been discussed in [12] ) which serves as a thermodynamic identity. The approach will be similar to the earlier section and hence the outcome will be covariant in nature. We start with the following evolution equation of the transversal deformation rate tensor Ξ ab along the null generators l a of the hypersurface H: The detailed derivation of this is given in [15] . Taking trace on both sides we obtain the following identity: See Appendix A for the derivation of this. Similar to NRC for l a , equation (34) can be interpreted as the evaluation equation for θ (k) along l a . Another point to be noted is that one can write l a ∇ a θ (k) = k a ∇ a θ (l) and then this provides the directional derivative of θ (l) along k a . This has been sketched in Appendix D. Below we shall show taking inspiration from the earlier section, the NRC equation (34) via the virtual displacement along k a can also be provided an interpretation as a thermodynamic relation on the 2-surface, without explicitly invoking the underlying dynamical equation for gravity. The auxiliary null vector field k i is parametrised as k i = −(dx i /dλ (k) ), where λ (k) is the parameter along the k i field. Note that negative sign is chosen here in the parametrisation. The reason is as follows. Usually the null vector l a is chosen to be outgoing and so x a increases along this direction. Whereas the auxiliary vector k a is regarded as ingoing one and hence x a decreases along this field. Now here we are interested in the thermodynamic interpretation of (34) when evaluated along k a . In this case, to identify the relevant thermodynamic entities like entropy, energy, etc. in its usual meaning it is required to define change of x a along k a as positive one. Therefore we have the coordinate variation under the virtual displacement δλ (k) as δx a = −k a δλ (k) . The physical interpretation of this displacement has been explained in [12] and we briefly mention it here. Let us consider two null surfaces under the null based foliation of the spacetime by the family H Φ . The null surfaces have to be the solutions to the specific theory of gravity that we are considering implicitly. Let us suppose that the null surfaces are stationed at λ (k) = 0 and λ (k) = δλ (k) . The virtual displacement δλ (k) is essentially a process that lets us shift from one solution of the hypersurface to the other since k a is an ingoing vector. Then the expansion of the congruence of the auxiliary null vector field in terms of rate of area element of S t is given as, The details of this relation has been sketched in Appendix C. Now we multiply both sides of (34) with δλ (k) and the elemental area √ qd 2 x on the 2-surface S t along with an overall factor of 1 8πG . Then the integration over the 2surface yields, The LHS of above equation (36) can be rewritten in the following form: where we associate the temperature T of the null surface S t as being related to the non-affinity parameter via T = (κ/2π). The entropy density s of the null surface is identified to be s = ( √ q/4G). We identify this entropy density defined on the null hypersurface to be the entanglement entropy density. We will have more to say on the nature of this entropy density shortly. Now focusing on the first term on the RHS of (36), we identify it as the variation of the energy associated with the null surface S t under the virtual displacement δλ (k) , i.e Performing an indefinite integration over λ (k) allows us to have an expression for the energy associated with the 2-surface S t , Before proceeding ahead, we note that the expression of the energy as obtained in (39) is reminiscent of the Hawking-Hayward energy definition [45, 46] . Our aim here is to show that the analogous Null Raychaudhuri equation for the auxiliary null vector field k i (34) has a thermodynamic interpretation under the process of the virtual displacement δλ (k) . That is, we proceed towards interpreting (36) as a thermodynamic identity. To this end we have identified the LHS of (36) as T δ λ(k) s integrated on the null 2-surface S t and the first term on the RHS of (36) as the variation of the energy of the null surface under the virtual displacement. The thermodynamic identity would be complete if we are allowed to interpret the second term of of (36) as the virtual work done under the displacement of the null surface S t by δλ (k) . Allowing ourselves the liberty, we identify the ""geometric work function"" associated with the virtual displacement δλ (k) as P = −1/(8πG)(R ij l i k j + 1 2 R). Following this, we have, where F is the integral of the work function over the transverse space S t of the null surface and F δλ (k) is to be interpreted as the virtual work done under δλ (k) . Combining (37), (38) and (40), we see that (36) can be succinctly formulated as, We remind that this interpretation holds for all the variations that are consistent with the virtual displacement. That is to physically interpret this, let us say that our virtual displacement is a ""physical"" process that virtually shifts our null surface H from say λ (k) = 0 to λ (k) = δλ (k) . Under such a virtual variation process energy flows through the null surface H. The energy is given by δ λ(k) E. The energy then contributes to the heat energy St d 2 xT δ λ(k) s and the virtual work done F δλ (k) under this virtual displacement process. We further note that the expression of the energy (39) can be rewritten as, having noted that χ represents the following integral over S t (a 2 dimensional manifold) defined as, If the transverse space S t of the null surface is compact then, χ is precisely equal to the Euler characteristic of the S t ; if not, then χ is defined via the integral (43) . For example if the topology of H is R × S 2 , then S t is the compact surface S 2 and hence χ then represents the Euler characteristics of the sphere. Now, we restrict to the special case where the nonaffinity parameter κ and hence the temperature T associated with the null surface S t is independent of the transverse coordinates of S t (for example a stationary black hole system). In that sense T can be taken outside the integral, and then identifying the total change of the entropy S of the null surface under the virtual displacement as δ λ(k) S = St d 2 xδ λ(k) s , we have further simplification of (41), Before proceeding ahead towards showing the equivalence of our approach with previous results and interpretations let us mention the differences instead first. We iterate that our analysis is independent of any gravitational theory as per se. For example we have not invoked the Einstein's field equations or any other gravitational field equation for that matter in our interpretation of the Null Raychaudhuri equation for k i as providing a thermodynamic identity. This is in contrast to previous results, which have been specifically formulated for explicit theories of gravity [12, 30, 40] . This is precisely the reason as to why we define a gravitational/geometric work function P = −1/(8πG)(R ij l i k j + 1 2 R) as opposed to P = −T ab l a k b as is done in previous works [12, 30, 40] which identify the work function or pressure entirely in terms of the matter energy momentum tensor. This also entails as to why irrespective of any gravitational theory, we have identified the entropy density of the null hypersurface under the virtual displacement process to be the entanglement entropy density. The observer under such a virtual displacement process is the null observer moving along the integral curves of the null generators l a . We assume that our generic null hypersurface H actually partitions the spactime into timelike and spacelike regions. Then the quantum fields living in spatial slices on both these two sides can be entangled. The degrees of freedom (dof) of the quantum fields in the spacelike acausal region is not accessible to a timelike observer in the timelike causal region. The timelike observer then calculates the reduced density matrix by tracing out the dof of the quantum fields on the acausal side. The entanglement entropy is then defined as the Von Nuemann entropy of this reduced density matrix. By introducing a momentum cut-off the entanglement entropy is shown to be proportional to the area of the null surface H. Since the entropy density introduced in our case is proportional to √ q, with an analogy to entanglement entropy, we propose that this as entanglement entropy density as measured by the null observer, moving along l a . In this regard we mention that a similar concept has been taken by Jacobson [19, 20, 25] at the very beginning of his analysis in order to obtain the Einstein's equation by extremizing the entropy of the Rindler horizon as well as for a causal diamond. Let us mention again, that in our analysis leading towards the thermodynamic interpretation (under the virtual displacement δλ (k) ), (41) is independent of any coordinate system as opposed to [12, 30] , which produces the equivalent thermodynamic identity, but under the null adapted GNC coordinates. A specific requirement under the GNC system is the fact that there is only one null hypersurface stationed at the position r = 0. This null hypersurface partitions the spacetime between timelike and spacelike regions. However in our case, we have foliated the spacetime in the neighbourhood of H by a family of null hypersurfaces H Φ and have focussed on producing the theroralesmodynamic identity on any one of them, say H Φ=1 = H. A specific advantage of such a foliation is that all the relevant geometrical quantities that can be defined on the null surface (for example expansion scalar, second fundamental form etc) are independent of the foliation. Another requirement specific to the GNC analysis is that the auxiliary null vector field is affinely parametrized i.e k a = −∂ a u or in other words k a is hypersurface orthogonal to u = constant surfaces. This, we believe is a certain restriction on the analysis. We can however do away with such a restriction. Under the system of the foliation of spacetime introduced in II, we do not require k a to be affinely parametrized and hypersurface orthogonal. In fact, under this general structure, the hyperplane normal to k a cannot be integrated into some integrable surface. As a result of such a null foliation of the spacetime in the vicinity of H, our interpretation of the energy and the work function pertain entirely to geometric quantities defined in the spacetime manifold. The way we have made a distinction between the energy term and the work function is to identify that the energy expression (39) contains terms that are defined on the null 2-surface S t along with a term involving the directional derivative of such quantities defined on S t . However the work function (40) contains terms that are defined for the entire spacetime manifold. In doing so, we have obtained a covariant (but foliation based) expression of the energy of the null surface. Previous expositions [12, 30] into the energy term under the purview of providing a thermodynamic interpretation have however come under the context of an adapted coordinate system w.r.t a fiduciary null surface i.e the GNC construction. As a result, previous such descriptions of the energy have been coordinate dependant. As a mathematical curiosity, the above relation (34) can also be derived in an alternative method following [40] . In [40] , the thermodynamic identity analogous to equation (44) was shown for static null horizons. We generalize the results to any arbitrary null hypersurface via the use of two following relations. The first one relates the Ricci tensor ( 2 R ab ) of the 2-dimensional transverse Riemannian manifold (S t , q) with the 4-dimensional Riemann curvature tensor of the spactime (M, g), the second fundamental form Θ ab of the null hypersurface H and the transversal deformation rate Ξ ab (see [15] ), Taking the trace of the above equation, we obtain, Using the definition of the orthogonal projection tensor onto the 2-surface S t as q ab = g ab + l a k b + k a l b , we have, Similarly using the irreducible decomposition of both the second fundamental form of H and the traversal deformation tensor of the two surface S t i.e Θ ab = 1 2 θ (l) q ab + σ ab and Ξ ab = 1 2 θ (k) q ab + σ (k)ab , we get, 2Θ ab Ξ ab = θ (l) θ (k) + 2σ ab σ ab (k) . Upon using the equations (47) and (48) in equation (46), we obtain as a result, The second relation that will be put to use is, (50) A detailed derivation of the above result is provided in appendix B. In fact the relation (50) can be regarded as a generalization to Eq. (5) of [40] (which is valid only for static null horizons) to any arbitrary null surface. Now simply the use of equation (50) in equation (49) leads us to equation (34) . Let us conclude this section by mentioning that in Appendix (E), we show the equivalence of the energy term (39) and the gravitational/geometric work function term with those obtained in [12] via the GNC construction under the purview of Einstein gravity.@story_separate@In the present work, we have investigated as to whether the components R ab l a l b and R ab l a k b can be provided any physical interpretation in a covariant fashion. Our starting point in both the cases have been the NRC equation (for l a and k a fields), which is a covariantly formulated geometrical relationship involving the evolution of a particular geometrical quantity with either R ab l a l b or R ab l a k b . For R ab l a l b , we started with the NRC for the null generators l a (13), and then provided a virtual displacement δλ (l) . We then integrated the resulting equation onto the transverse spacelike 2-surface S t and obtained relevant thermodynamical structures (17) and (25) . We have provided two alternative interpretations of the resulting thermodynamic identity. In the first interpretation (17), we identified that under the virtual displacement process δλ (l) , an amount of energy δ λ(l) E sweeps across through the null surface H. The expression of the energy is provided in (18) . This energy flow results in the heat exchanged as a result of the entropy variation of the null surface. The temperature of H is associated with the non-affinity parameter κ of the null generators and the entropy density is proportional to √ q of the area element of S t . In our second interpretation (25), we have identified energy variation δ λ(l) E that flows (as a result of the virtual displacement process) across through the null surface H to be given by (22) . This results in the two types of heat generation terms. The first is the heat energy generation (20) due to the variation of the equilibrium entropy density identified as δ λ(l) s eq , where s eq is again proportional to √ q of the area element of S t . The second contribution results in the heat generation (24) due to the viscous dissipative effects present in the null surface. We also identified that this irreversible heat generation must be entirely due to geometric fluxes since the dissipation term contains only geometrical quantities established on H. Finally, we showed for the explicit case of a stationary black hole system, that the integrated form of the NRC (for l a ) over the virtual displacement produces the generalized Smarr formula (32) . We also showed that the energy term (in both our interpretations) is proportional to the Komar energy term (29) for this special case. Next we focused on the more relevant component R ab l a k b for providing the thermodynamical interpretation in a covariant fashion. In literature, previous works [12, 26, 27] had solidified the fact that R ab l a k b can be provided a thermodynamical relationship which is structurally quite similar to the first law of thermodynamics. However they had been proposed in an adapted coordinate system called the GNC system. This results in the expression of the energy being dependant on the GNC coordinates. Here, we have tried to show, whether a similar interpretation can be provided without the need of adapting any coordinate system w.r.t the null surface. In our approach we started out with the NRC equation (for k a field) (34) and provided a virtual displacement δλ (k) . We then integrated the resulting equation over the 2-surface S t . This procedure allowed us to obtain our required thermodynamic interpretation in a covariant fashion. However our proposed interpretation does have major differences with the previous approaches. We have not invoked in our analysis any specific gravitational field equations and hence proposed that our interpretation is not specific to any particular theory of gravity. This required us to propose that the entropy density of the null surface is actually the entanglement entropy density assigned to H by a null observer moving along the integral curves of the null generators l a . This is because in our case the entropy density is actually proportional to √ q of our area element on the 2-surface S t . The temperature is again found to be proportional to the non-affinity parameter κ associated with the null generators l a . To have a consistent thermodynamic interpretation irrespective of any particular theory of gravity we have defined a so called geometric pressure P = −1/(8πG)(R ij l i k j + 1 2 R). This is in contrast with the earlier methods defining the pressure entirely through the matter energy tensor. Moreover, the identified energy here is in covariant form and so can be applied to any metric adapted to the null surface. This added advantage of our formalism must be very useful for further progress of this field. Finally, we feel that the present results are very generic to any null surface as the underlying dynamics of background has not been explicitly used. Instead the construction is purely based on the geometrical properties of the aforesaid surface. We hope that this new foray into the the well known study of the thermodynamical structure of a generic null hypersurface via our covariant approach will help to shed some light on it. Upon using the relations l a ∇ a l b = κl b , l a ∇ a k b = ω b and ω a = Ω a − κk a , we contract the above Eq. (B4) with k b l c to have, We now focus on the first term of the RHS of Eq. (B3) i.e l a ∇ b (∇ a k c ). Again upon using Eq. (B2), we have, Contracting the above Eq. (B6) with k b l c and using the fact that Ω a l a = 0, Ω a k a = 0 and ω a l a = κ we obtain, We focus on the first term of the RHS of Eq. (B7) i.e l a k b (∇ b Ω a ), Upon using the completeness relation δ a b = q a b − l b k a − l a k b , we have after some simple algebra, Putting Eq. (B9) into Eq. (B7), we obtain, We now contract the Ricci Identity i.e Eq. (B3) on both sides with k b l c . Following this we use the relations (B5) and (B10) onto the contracted Ricci Identity to obtain, The term −2κl c k i (∇ i k c ) can further be manipulated as, Putting Eq. (B12) in Eq. (B11) we obtain as a result, Following this result, we focus on the last term on the RHS of Eq. (B13) i.e l c l a ∇ a (k i ∇ i k c ) and manipulate it in the following sense, Upon using Eq. (B2), we have, We proceed to manipulate the last term on the RHS of Eq. (B14) with the help of Eq. (B2) , Putting Eq. (B15) in Eq. (B14) we obtain along with the use of Eq. (B2), Putting the value of l c l a ∇ a (k i ∇ i k c ) from Eq. (B16) in Eq. (B13), we obtain, Expanding the above result and after a few lines of simple manipulations we obtain, To this end, we focus at the −q ab (l i ∇ i Ξ ab ) term and using the fact, along with Eq. (B1), we have, Upon using the irreducible decomposition of the transversal deformation rate tensor Ξ ab , it is fairly straightforward to show that, Using Eq. (B20) in Eq. (B19), we obtain, Upon using Eq. (B21) and the relation −κl c k i (∇ i k c ) = −κθ (k) + κ(∇ a k a ) in Eq. (B18), we have as a result, Let us now take a look at the term (∇ a l i )(∇ i k a ). Using the relations (B1) and (B2), it can manipulated quite simply to be, (B23) Looking at the last term on the RHS of Eq. (B23), i.e l a k b (∇ b ω a ) , we obtain in the process of manipulation as Equating Eq. (B24) in Eq. (B23), we have, Looking at Eq. (B22) we manipulate the terms (∇ a Ω a )− κ(∇ a k a ) using the relation ω a = Ω a − κk a , To this end, we obtain, using Eq. (B26) and Eq. (B25), Finally, putting Eq. (B27) in Eq. (B22) we obtain our desired result, Appendix C: Derivation of Eq. (35) We have by definition, Taking trace of the above equation, we obtain, and using the irreducible decomposition of Ξ ab , i.e Ξ ab = 1/2q ab θ (k) + σ ab (k) we have Using the definition of the projection tensor and the Lie derivative its quite simple to show, Now we show that θ (k) is actually equivalent to − 1 √ q d dλ (k) √ q. For that we note that the basis vectors e a A are actually Lie transported along the k a fields i.e £ k e a A = 0. As a result we can write, d √ q Now using the fact that k i ∇ i e a A = e i A ∇ i k a , we have, Hence, the result of (35) follows. end, we mention that the metric expressed in the GNC (u, r, x A ) reads, where the six independent parameters (α, β A , q AB ) are dependant on the coordinates (u, r, x A ). The null hypersurface in this system is stationed at r = 0. The relevant inverse metric as well as its Christoffel connection coefficients have been calculated in [33] . The components of the null normal and the auxiliary null normal in this coordinate system are, l a = (0, 1, 0, 0) k a = (−1, 0, 0, 0) l a = (1, 2rα + r 2 β 2 , rβ A ) k a = (0, −1, 0, 0) . Before proceeding ahead, we now invoke the Einstein's field equations and note that the work function previously defined as P = −1/(8πG)(R ij l i k j + 1 2 R) when evaluated on the null hypersurface r = 0, yields P = −1/(8πG)(R ij l i k j + 1 2 R) = (−T ij l i k j ) = (−T ij l i k j ) = −T a b l a k b = T ur = T r r = T ur = T u u . In static spherically symmetric spacetimes T r r has the interpretation of being the radial or the normal pressure [40, 47] . Hence the integral of the work function F = St d 2 x √ qP in the static spherically symmetric case is F = St d 2 x √ qP = St d 2 x √ qT r r , which is to be interpreted as the average normal force on S t We note that all the quantities in the integrand of the expression of energy (39) are to be evaluated on the null hypersurface i.e at r = 0. Looking at the term θ (l) , we obtain, θ (l) = q ab ∇ a l b = −q AB Γ r AB . The value of Γ r AB , Γ r AB = − 1 2 ∂ u q AB − 1 2 (r 2 β 2 + 2rα)∂ r q AB Evaluating θ (l) on the null hypersurface, Computation of k i ∇ i θ (l) on the null hypersurface, with the components of k i given in (E2), yields, Looking at the computation of θ (k) , we have, The value of Γ u AB is − 1 2 ∂ r q AB . Evaluating θ (k) on the null hypersurface, This allows us to have, Next, noting that Ω a = ω a + κk a , we have Ω a Ω a = ω a ω a , where ω a refers to the rotation one form defined in the manifold. For the evaluation of ω a = l i ∇ i k a , with l i and k a provided from (E2), we have, As a consequence of this, we have ω a ω a = ω A ω A . The relevant quantities are, Evaluation of Ω a Ω a on the null hypersurface at r = 0 yields, Finally we are left with the evaluation of 2 D A Ω A on the null hypersurface. The calculations follow as, In the G.N.C coordinates, the virtual displacement δx a = dx a dλ (k) δλ = −k a δλ = (0, δλ = δr, 0, 0). Finally putting the values of the relevant quantities obtained in (E9), (E12) and (E15) into the expression of the energy in (39), we obtain, We note that, (E17) With this, the energy of the null hypersurface manifests as, We find that the expression of the Energy obtained in the GNC (E18) via the covariant form of the expression of the energy (39) matches with Eq. (53) in [12] . Provided the 2-dimension surface S t is compact, the above expression can be simplified to, The reason as to why (E19) is called the energy term is because it provides the expression of the energy in quite a few well known cases. For a review of these specific cases please see [12] . As an example, for the Schwarzchild metric the energy term (E19) reduces to the mass.","We readdress the thermodynamic structure of geometrical relations on a generic null surface. Among three potential candidates, originated from different components of $R_{ab}$ along the null vectors for the surface (i.e. $R_{ab}q^a_cl^b$, $R_{ab}l^al^b$ and $R_{ab}l^ak^b$ where $q_{ab}$ is the projector on the null surface and $l^a$, $k^a$ are null normal and corresponding auxiliary vector of it, respectively), the first one leads to Navier-Stokes like equation. Here we devote our investigation on the other two members. We find that $R_{ab}l^al^b$, which yields the evolution equation for expansion parameter corresponding to $l^a$ along itself, can be interpreted as a thermodynamic relation when integrated on the two dimensional transverse subspace of the null hypersurface along with a virtual displacement in the direction of $l^a$. Moreover for a stationary background the integrated version of it yields the general form of Smarr formula. Although this is more or less known in literature, but a similar argument for the evolution equation of the expansion parameter corresponding to $k^a$ along $l^a$, provided by $R_{ab}l^ak^b$, leads to a more convenient form of thermodynamic relation. In this analysis, contrary to earlier approaches, the identified thermodynamic entities come out to be in covariant forms and also are foliation independent. Hence these can be applied to any coordinate system adapted to the null hypersurface. Moreover, these results are not restricted to any specific parametrisation of $k^a$ and also $k^a$ need not be hypersurface orthogonal. In addition, here any particular dynamical equation for metric is not being explicitly used and therefore we feel that our results are solely based on the properties of the null surface."
"The Coronavirus disease pandemic was first reported in Hubei, China, in December 2019. So far, it has affected about six million people and has led to the death of more than 360,000 people around the world mostly due to severe acute respiratory illness (Ashamalla et al., 2020) . Given the lack of an effective treatment for COVID-19, different countries around the world focused their efforts on reducing the risk of transmission through implementing public health measures, such as social distancing, self-isolation, and regular hand washing. In addition, unprecedented measures, such as controlling borders, contact tracing, and lockdown were taken (Ahorsu et al., 2020a; Alyami et al., 2020) . These measures led to widespread fear so that in some countries people started to stockpile staple foods, toilet paper, and even guns (Bakioglu et al., 2020; Skoda et al., 2020) . As the prevalence of COVID-19 increased, people started to isolate themselves, limit their social interactions, and avoid others for fear of getting the virus (Abuhammad et al., 2020) . Fear is an adaptive response to one's environment and a defense mechanism to increase the chance of one's survival; however, it can be maladaptive when it is not proportionate to the actual threat (Steimer, 2002) . During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Ebola outbreaks, public fear worsened the negative effects of the actual illness; therefore, one of the most important challenges in the face of outbreaks is to control social reactions (García-Reyna et al., 2020) . In order to reduce possible psychological problems, researchers recommend that the level of fear, worry, and helplessness associated with COVID-19 should be examined, because high levels of stress may prevent one from making logical decisions to protect themselves (Ahorsu et al., 2020a) . For example, some patients who need medical care may refuse to go to the hospital due to experiencing illogical levels of fear (WongLaura et al., 2020) . Some patients may postpone their surgical treatment for fear of contracting the virus (Vanni et al., 2020) . In some cases, fear of COVID-19 can lead to hypochondriasis, so that some people may misinterpret their bodily sensations and attribute them to COVID-19 (Coelho et al., 2020) . Some people may also excessively use medications recommended in COVID-19 treatment guidelines, such as hydroxychloroquine (Banerjee, 2020) . On the other hand, fear can act as a motivator of behavioral change in the face of COVID-19 (Harper et al., 2020; Pakpour and Griffiths, 2020) . The experience of fear can increase risk perception and reinforce protective behaviors, such as washing of hands and keeping physical distance (Broche-Pérez et al., 2020) . When people take a threat seriously, they can perform preventive measures more efficiently, and perception of threat as a motivator facilitates the prevention of COVID-19. Harper et al. found that fear of COVID-19 strongly predicted improved social distancing and hand washing and had an important role in adherence to public health measures related to COVID-19 (Harper et al., 2020) . The COVID-19 pandemic has led to fear and negative emotions; however, it has also had positive consequences, such as encouraging people to engage in ethical behavior (Jian et al., 2020) . According to what was explained above, measuring fear of COVID-19 has an important role in understating the implications of the pandemic for mental health and in designing interventions to reduce COVID-19 fear and anxiety. One of the most important instruments available to assess fear of COVID-19 is the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) that has been translated to many languages. Studies form different parts of the world examining fear of COVID-19 have led to different results. Therefore, the goal of the present systematic review and metaanalysis is to estimate the pooled mean of fear of COVID-19 around the world.@story_separate@The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled mean of fear of COVID-19 based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al., 2009 ). Search for articles was conducted in September 20, 2020, in databases of Web of science/ISI, PubMed, and Scopus using the following keywords: Wuhan Coronavirus, Sars-cov-2, 2019 Novel Coronavirus, COVID-19 Virus, Coronavirus Disease 2019 Virus, Wuhan Seafood Market Pneumonia Virus, Fear, and all possible combination to increase search sensitivity. In addition, references of the selected articles were reviewed to access more related articles. All observational studies published in English examining the state of fear of COVID-19 using the FCV-19S were analyzed. This scale developed by Ahorsu et al. assesses fear of COVID-19 using seven items that are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 5 (totally agree) to 1 (totally disagree). Total score on this scale ranges from 7 to 35, and higher scores indicate stronger fear of COVID-19 (Ahorsu et al., 2020a) . The inclusion criteria were as follows: participants aged at least 18 years and reporting the mean and standard deviation of fear of COVID-19 score. Articles with unavailable full texts, preprinted articles, and articles not reporting the fear of COVID-19 score were excluded from the analysis. In the first step, two independent authors screened the articles and selected those having the aforementioned keywords in their titles or abstracts. Then, they extracted the article information and recorded it in a predesigned Excel sheet. This information included first author's name, publication year, mean age of patients, target population, mean and standard deviations of fear of COVID-19 (total score and score by gender). Because all the selected articles had been published in 2020, publication year was not included in the table presenting article information. The two researchers independently evaluated the quality of the articles based on 10 items of Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist (title and abstract, study environment, objectives and hypotheses, sample size, inclusion criteria, statistical methods, descriptive data, interpretation of findings, limitations, and funding). Higher scores indicate better methodological quality. In terms of methodological quality, articles were divided into three categories: poor (4 or below), moderate (4 to 7), and good (over 7) (Vandenbroucke et al., 2007) . Random effects model was used to estimate the pooled raw mean of fear of COVID-19. A forest plot was used to visually depict heterogeneity across studies in which the mean of fear of COVID-19 with a 95% confidence interval and also the pooled raw mean of the selected studies are reported. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using I 2 statistic and Cochran's Q test. I 2 percentages of 25%, 50%, and 75% show low, average, and high heterogeneity, respectively, and in Cochran's Q test, P < 0.1 indicates significant heterogeneity (Higgins et al., 2003) . Source of heterogeneity across studies was examined using subgroup analysis by gender, continent (Asia/America/Europe/Australia/multi-countries), and target population (general population, college students, pregnant women, and medical staff). The association of the mean of fear of COVID-19 with sample size and mean age of participants was assessed using meta-regression analysis. To ensure that the meta-regression results were not affected by one or several articles, leave-one-out sensitivity analysis method was used that involved performing the analysis on the data by leaving out one study at a time. For studies reporting scores by drop out one study at a time and estimate the pooled raw mean of remained studies. In addition, the potential effect of small studies was assessed using a funnel plot based on Egger's regression test (Egger et al., 1997) . It is worthwhile to note that all analyses were performed based on random effects model using R software, version 4.0.3, and that all statistical tests were two-tailed ones. In addition, the significance level for all tests except for examination of heterogeneity across studies was set at P < 0.05. In the primary search, a total of 634 articles were found, of which 320 duplicate articles were excluded, and titles and abstracts of the remaining articles were reviewed. In addition, 270 articles focused on unrelated subjects were removed from the analysis. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of selecting and screening articles based on the PRISMA guidelines. A total of 44 articles with a sample size of 52,462 were included in the final analysis. As shown in Table 1 , among the 44 articles, 33 reported the total score of fear of COVID-19, 8 (Abad et al., 2020; Bakioglu et al., 2020; Broche-Pérez et al., 2020; Haktanir et al., 2020; Hossain et al., 2020; Mertens et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2020a; Sakib et al., 2020) . These studies had been conducted with the general population, college students, pregnant women, and medical staff. Detailed information on selection of articles is provided in Table 1 . In terms of methodological quality, eight studies had medium quality, and the remaining articles had excellent quality. According to the level of heterogeneity across studies, random effects model was used to combine the studies (P < 0.0001; Q = 8243.69, df = 32, P < 0.0001, τ 2 = 7.9730, and I 2 = 99.6%). In the present study, the pooled mean of fear of COVID-19 was found to be 18.57 (95% CI: 17.60-19.54). In addition, the prediction interval for the pooled mean of fear of COVID-19 was found to be 12.72-24.42 (Figure 2) . Among the selected studies, 17 reported the mean of fear of COVID-19 by item; the highest and lowest mean scores were related to items #1 (3.32) and #3 (1.78), respectively. It is worthwhile to note that the mean of fear of COVD-19 for all items was higher in Asian studies compared to those conducted in other continents. The Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org lowest scores on items #1, #3, #5, and #6 were reported by the American studies, the lowest scores on items #4 and #7 were reported by Australian studies, and the lowest scores on item #2 were reported by European studies. In addition, the mean of fear of COVD-19 on all items except for items #1 and #4 was higher in the general population than in college students. The pooled mean of fear of COVD-19 by item is presented in Table 2 ( Supplementary Figures 1-7) . The pooled raw mean of fear of COVID-19 was examined using random effects model. According to the results of subgroup analysis, the highest and lowest pooled means of fear of COVID-19 were reported in the studies conducted in Asia (18.36, and Australia (17.43, ), respectively (Supplementary Figure 8) . In addition, the pooled raw mean of fear of COVID-19 was higher in medical staff than in other groups (Supplementary Figure 9) . According to the results of subgroup difference test reported in Table 3 , there was a significant difference in the mean of fear of COVID-19 in different continents (P = 0.0347), but there was no significant difference between different target populations (P = 0.0773). In addition, eight articles reported the mean of fear of COVID-19 by gender that was lower in men (18.21, ) than in women (20.67, 95% CI: 18.62-22.73) (Supplementary Figures 10, 11) . Moreover, the mean fear of COVID-19 was 17.68 and 19.70 in Asian men and women and 16.15 and 20.39 in American men and women, respectively (Supplementary Figures 12, 13) . The results of meta-regression analysis showed that mean score of fear of COVID-19 increased with mean age, but the relationship was not statistically significant (P = 0.797) (Figure 3 and Table 4) . Results of sensitivity analysis based on random effects model showed that none of the studies alone had a substantial impact on the pooled raw mean of fear of COVID-19 (Supplementary Figure 14) . Results of Egger's regression test also indicated that publication bias was not statistically significant (P = 0.721) (Supplementary Figure 15) . Examination of the pooled mean by continent and target population showed that on all items, it was higher in the studies conducted in Asia compared to those conducted in other continents. In addition, the pooled mean of fear of COVID-19 on all items except for items #1 and #4 was higher in the general population than in college students (Table 5) . Moreover, a significant difference was observed between studies conducted in different continents in terms of scores on item #2 of the scale (P < 0.0001), but there was no significant difference between different continents in terms of scores on other items. In addition, a significant difference was observed between different target populations in scores on items #6 and #7 (P < 0.05). The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled mean of fear of COVID-19. The results showed that the participants in the reviewed studies had obtained 41% of the total score on the the FCV-19s. Fear of COVID-19 leads to stigmatization and social exclusion of patients and their families, and makes them vulnerable to adjustment problems, depression, irritability, anxiety, and anger (Abad et al., 2020; Satici et al., 2020b; Zhang et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is important to pay attention to implications of COVID-19 for psychological health, because pandemics can lead to crisis in psychological, social, and economic domains (Xiang et al., 2020) . Fear is not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic and has been observed in other outbreaks, including those of HIV and SARS (Ho et al., 2005) . The pooled mean of fear of COVID-19 was higher in women than in men. This finding can be attributed to the fact that women are more delicate and vulnerable than men. In addition, Bakioglu et al. (2020) found that it was more acceptable for women to express their fears of illness. On the other hand, it is more acceptable for men to be strong and brave. In addition, because men are less likely than women to become ill, they tend to be less afraid of COVID-19. The results of the present study showed that the highest and lowest fears of COVID-19 scores were in studies conducted in Asia and Australia, respectively. This finding can be attributed to the fact that before spreading to other countries, COVID-19 was reported in China as an Asian country; therefore, people in China and other Asian countries experienced higher levels of fear of the new virus. Overall, different rates of fear of COVID-19 in different countries can be attributed to contextual and cultural factors and different levels of access to medical services. Isolation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased rates of mental problems, such as anxiety, anger, PTSD, confusion, and even suicide (Giordani et al., 2020; Haktanir et al., 2020; Mamun and Griffiths, 2020a) . For example, a Bangladeshi man killed himself because he thought that he had the new virus, but the autopsy showed that he actually did not (Mamun and Griffiths, 2020b) . Therefore, misconceptions about COVID-19 can lead to increased xenophobia and suicide ideation. The same pattern had been observed during the SARS outbreak in Asia (Hong Kong) (Cheung et al., 2008) . The pooled mean of fear of COVID-19 was higher in medical staff than in other target groups. This group became involved in fighting the new virus when health systems were not adequately prepared to respond to the pandemic (1). Longterm exposure to confirmed and also unrecognized COVID-19 patients, insufficient training on prevention and control of infectious diseases, and shortage of protective equipment were factors putting healthcare providers at higher risk of COVID-19 and, as a result, fear of the pandemic (Wang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Nguyen et al. showed that the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was three times higher in healthcare workers than in the general population (Nguyen et al., 2020b) . Fear in healthcare providers is not limited to COVID-19 and has been reported during other outbreaks, including those of HIV (Montgomery and Lewis, 1995) and SARS (Ho et al., 2005) . The highest and lowest pooled means were related to items #1 and #3 of the scale, respectively. This finding can be attributed to what the items assess. Item #1 directly assesses fear of COVID-19, while item #3 asks about symptoms of fear of COVID-19. One of the limitations of this study was the exclusion of preprint studies. Due to the large number of studies, it was not possible to review this type of articles in this meta-analysis and it is suggested that this type of articles be reviewed in future studies.  The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the Corresponding author.

SD: statistical analysis.@story_separate@The excessive fear observed in previous outbreaks, including those of HIV and Ebola, has also been reported in the current COVID-19 pandemic and can be observed in the future. Excessive fear can negatively impact one's life in personal (e.g., mental health problems) and social (panic shopping and xenophobia) domains, while a normal (logical) level of fear can help one pay more attention to government measures aimed at reducing the spread of . The results of the present study showed that a moderate level of fear is required to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 and that fear of COVID-19 can be controlled and prevented from turning into excessive fear through providing effective training programs for different populations.","Background: Due to lack of preparedness of health systems, fast spread of the new virus, high mortality rates, and lack of a definite treatment, the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led to high levels of fear and anxiety in different populations. In addition, isolation, mental disorders, and limitations in social interactions as a result of lockdown and travel ban increased the fear of the new coronavirus. Methods: International databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google scholar, were searched without any time limitation, and all observational studies published in English reporting the mean of fear of COVID-19 based on the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) were included in the analysis. Methodological quality was assessed using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. Random effects model, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression analysis were used to analyze the data. Heterogeneity across studies was examined using Cochran's Q test and I(2) statistic. All the statistical analyses were conducted using R software v4.0.3. Results: A total of 44 articles with a sample size of 52,462 were reviewed. A pooled mean of 18.57 was found for fear of COVID-19. The mean of fear of COVID-19 was higher in women than in men (20.67 vs. 18.21). The highest and lowest means of fear of COVID-19 had been found in Asia (18.36) and Australia (17.43) based on continent, and in hospital staff (19.51) and college students (17.95) based on target population, respectively. In addition, the highest and lowest means of fear of COVID-19 were related to items #1 and #3 of the scale, respectively. According to the results of meta-regression analysis, there was no significant association between the mean of fear of COVID-19 and sample size and participants' age. In addition, publication error was not significant (P = 0.721). Conclusion: The mean of fear of COVID-19 was high around the world; therefore, it seems necessary to pay more attention to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health."
"In December 2019, patients with pneumonia of unknown cause appeared in some medical institutions in Hubei province, China. A new coronavirus, initially named 2019-ncov, was identified as the causative agent of pneumonia. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus ""COVID-19."" At the same time, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that it was calling the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Medical researchers believe that SARS-CoV-2 is probably closely related to the coronavirus carried by the Chinese horseshoe bat, but the intermediate host has not been confirmed. SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV first occurred from November 2002 to June 2003 in Guangdong, China, and spread to many parts of the world. MERS-CoV was found in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Its main outbreak areas were in the Middle East and South Korea, and it occurred occasionally elsewhere. The dynamics of SARS and MERS have made some progress. At present, there are two main mathematical models of epidemiological dynamics: the deterministic model and the stochastic model. Donnelly et al. (2003) measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patients'age and the time from onset to admission. They estimated that the mean incubation period of the disease was 6.4 days, and that the mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic. Lipsitch et al. (2003) estimated that a single infectious case of SARS would infect about three secondary cases in a population that had not yet instituted control measures. Public-health efforts to reduce transmission were expected to have a substantial impact on reducing the size of the epidemic. Riley et al. (2003) analyzed the first 10 weeks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong, and presented that the epidemic was characterized by two large clusters initiated by two separate super-spread events (SSEs) and by ongoing community transmission. Excluding SSEs, they also estimated that 2.7 secondary infections were generated per case on average at the start of the epidemic, with a substantial contribution from hospital transmission. Li et al. (2004) used a logistic deterministic growth model to fit the data of some countries and regions, and some provinces and cities in mainland China, revealing the uneven infectious force of SARS in various regions, along with differences in prevention and control measures. Tan et al. (2003) established the SEIR epidemic model of SARS and a parameter identification system with incubation period and lifelong immunity, and demonstrated the main mathematical properties of the control model and the flow invariance and weak invariance of the system. Li et al. (2013) researched the problem of epidemic spreading dynamics on a multi-relationship network, proposed a kind of dual relationship network model (work-friends network), and studied the effect of multi-relationships on epidemic spread dynamics behavior. They also studied the outbreak threshold of epidemic spreading dynamics on complex networks (Li et al., 2016) , and summarized the similarities and differences of outbreak thresholds between the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) models. Kim and Jung (2018) ) studied the dynamic development https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104306 of MERS in the inter-organizational public health emergency management network, and mapped the communication and response network patterns during the outbreak of MERS. Through retrospective epidemiological analysis, Nishiura et al. (2016) ) studied the determinants of the heterogeneous transmission dynamics of the MERS outbreak in South Korea in 2015. They used the transmission tree to identify the super spenders and estimated the reproduction number of different types of hosts, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single major case, and its changes over time. To identify super spreaders in a complex network, Chen et al. (2019) ) proposed a fusion index, called the degree of extension center, by extracting and synthesizing topology feature information of traditional centrality indices and spreading influence to identify nodes, and conducted simulation experiments on four real networks and node removal to verify the accuracy of the proposed centricity. The classical SIR model describes the transmission of infection. People's response to epidemics affects transmission, thus information transmission is also considered often in the literature. Lu and Liu (2019) ) analyzed how the operation of information transmission affects infected individuals and the transmission conditions of epidemics and proposed a susceptibility-recovery-activity (SIR-A) model that maps infection and information transmission to a two-layer network based on the hypothesis that community size and individual consciousness may have an impact on infection rates. Ning et al. (2020) ) used an evolutionary game model of complex networks to study the process of epidemic transmission. Ning et al. selected strategies by assuming that individuals would compare their own benefits with those of neighboring individuals in the process of disease transmission, updated strategies using four simulation principles, analyzed counterintuitive phenomena, and found that simulation principles will affect the scope and severity of counterintuitive phenomena. Through epidemiological SIS investigation involving independent disseminators, Ding et al. (2019) ) explained that complex systems in which the dynamics of diffusion occur often have many underlying relationships that can facilitate the process of infectious disease transmission. Huang et al. (2019) ) studied the impact of human behavior and contact heterogeneity on the spread of infectious diseases. Based on the consideration of fear levels of individuals with different potential contact times with others, a network-based SIRS epidemic model with a general feedback mechanism was proposed. Zhang et al. (2018) ) proposed a novel susceptible-infected-susceptible-recovered-susceptible virus transmission model based on partial immunity and immune inefficiency in complex networks and studied the epidemic dynamics behavior of this model in unified networks and scale-free networks based on mean field theory. Liu et al. (2018) ) simulated an infection transmission process on multiplex contact networks accounting for the natural history of influenza and found that the classical concept of the basic reproduction number was untenable in realistic populations, and it did not provide any conceptual understanding of the epidemic evolution. Based on the complex network theory, Fan et al. (2020) ) established the SEIR dynamic model of 2019-ncov epidemic with incubation period, and predicted the epidemic inflection point through model parameter simulation.Based on Wuhan migration data, Yang et al. (2020) ) estimated the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan by the number of confirmed people and found that the rate of confirmed patients in 15 cities in Hubei province was lower than that in 35 cities outside the province in terms of the mean and median. Lombardi et al.'s research (Lombardi et al., 2020) showed that isolation of those affected and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were the mainstay to block transmission of this pathogen, which was presumed through respiratory droplets. A 14 days quarantine was applied to subjects coming from endemic areas or who had contact with confirmed cases. Fanelli and Piazza (2020) ) analyze the temporal dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China, Italy and France in the time window 22/ 01-15/03/2020. A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple meanfield models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals. These scholars studied the propagation rules of SARS and MERS from the aspects of deterministic models, stochastic models, and complex network propagation dynamics, but the propagation research of COVID-19 is just beginning. As a new infectious disease, the transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is not yet clear. Although SARS-CoV-2 is a kind of coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, there are still many questions to be studied about its infectious characteristics.@story_separate@We analyze the number of people infected with infectious diseases. The number of infectious cases is a function of time, expressed as N(t) at time t. When a new coronavirus occurs, people lack full understanding of its origin and route of transmission, which may lead to insufficient recognition of its prevention and control. Therefore, at the beginning, the growth rate of infections can be regarded as a constant r 0 . However, when the number of infected cases reaches a certain level, people will gradually devote increased attention to the epidemic disease and take measures such as disinfection and isolation. At this point, the growth rate of infected people decreases with the increase of their number N, i.e., the growth rate can be expressed as a monotonically decreasing function r(N). For simplicity, let us assume the growth rate r(N) is a linear function of the number of infected people N, r(N) = r 0 − sN, where r 0 is a constant indicating the growth rate of people doing nothing and letting the virus spread at will, and s is the infection inhibition constant, which reflects the effect of prevention and control measures taken to suppress infectious diseases. The larger s is, the more effective the prevention and control measures are. Moreover, it is assumed that under the combined effect of viral infectivity and prevention and control measures, the maximum number of infected cases is N max , i.e., when N = N max , the growth rate r(N max ) = 0. At this point, the infection inhibition constant s = r 0 /N max can be obtained. Notations: N(t) or N denotes the number of infectious cases at time t, while N max is the maximum number of N(t), i.e., the limit of N(t). r(N) is the growth rate of infected cases with N, and r 0 is the growth rate at the beginning with no measure taken. s denotes the infection inhibition constant. The multiplication cycle with no measure taken is denoted by T 0 and T denotes the multiplication cycle varied with the number of infected cases N, which has measures taken with N increasing. According to the hypothesis of the model, under the continuous setting, the number of newly infected persons ΔN within the time Δt can be expressed as the product of the growth rate r(N) and N, and the number of infected persons at t 0 is N 0 , so we can obtain the initial value problem of the differential equation of infected persons, (1) The first term, r 0 N, of differential equation (1) expresses the natural epidemic trend of infectious diseases in the absence of any prevention and control measures, while the second term, −r 0 N 2 /N max , shows the effect of prevention and control measures for communicable diseases. At the beginning of an epidemic of an infectious disease, due to the lack of strong prevention and control measures, the evolution of the epidemic law is mainly affected by the spreading characteristics of the virus itself, and the first term plays a leading role. At this moment, one can consider that −r 0 N 2 /N max = 0, and in this setting, the solution of the differential equation is This solution implies that the virus can spread freely without human intervention, and the number of infected people increases exponentially over multiple generations. In the outbreak of an infectious disease, the role of the second term gradually begins to assume a dominant position, the number of new cases gradually decreases and approaches zero, and the disease is finally under control. Eq. (1) is an initial-value problem of variable-separable differential equations, which can be solved by According to differential equation (1), the second derivative of N(t) is From the second derivative (4), it can be known that the change rate of infected persons dN/dt reaches its maximum when N = N max /2, i.e., the period of accelerated growth occurs when the number of infected persons reaches half of the limit value. Therefore, the moment corresponding to N = N max /2 can be called the inflection point of the number of new infections. The time span in which the number of infections increases from N to 2N is called a multiplication cycle. If there is no human intervention, it can be obtained from Eq. (2) that the multiplication cycle is T 0 = ln 2/ r 0 . The multiplication cycle depends only on the rate of infection r 0 without human intervention. With human intervention, such as protective measures, the multiplication cycle will not depend only on r 0 . From Eq. (3), we can obtain Suppose that the number of infections is N at moment t 1 and 2N at moment t 2 . Then, the multiplication cycle can be obtained as T is a function of the number of infected people N, with N max − 2N > 0. This inequality holds because when N approaches N max /2, the multiplication cycle will approach to infinity. The derivative of T is Thus, we know that T is a monotonically increasing function, T → T 0 when N → 0, while T → + ∞ when N → N max /2. This shows that when the inflection point occurs, the doubling of the number of infected people no longer occurs. The data used in this paper are from the WHO (http://www.who. int) and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/). The National Health Commission publishes data of accumulated and newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 from January 20, 2020, from which the data from January 21 to March 18 were selected. The regions selected were Hubei (HB), Guangdong (GD), Zhejiang (ZJ), and Henan (HN). The data of confirmed SARS cases were selected from April 21, 2003, to June 30, 2003. The selected countries or regions were China (excluding Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) (Nat), Guangdong (GD), Beijing (BJ), and Hong Kong (HK). Saudi Arabia's MERS case data were selected for analysis. Fig. 1 shows the number of weekly infections in Saudi Arabia from the 12th week of 2012 to the 24th week of 2019. As can be seen from Fig. 1 , Saudi Arabia experienced four significant MERS outbreaks, from week 7 to week 23 in 2014, week 1 to week 12 in 2015, week 15 to week 26 in 2015, and week 28 to week 39 in 2015. These four outbreak cycles are recorded as C#1, C#2, C#3, and C#4, respectively. We selected these four cycles of MERS cases for analysis. The software 1stOpt and its Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm (Bi and Liang, 2018; Liang and Clay, 2019) were used to fit Eq. (3). The number of cases of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS in each region was fitted using model (3), and the fitting effect was significant. Table 1 shows the results, where the correlation coefficient measures the degree of linear correlation between N and t, and the determination coefficient reflects the reliability of the regression function N(t). The values of the correlation coefficient and the determination coefficient both go from 0 to 1. According to Table 1 , the minimum values of the correlation coefficient and determination coefficient are 0.9822 and 0.9647, respectively. For the number of COVID-19 cases of Hubei, the values of N max are fairly close to the real cases, and the absolute value of the average relative error is less than 3%. The true number of confirmed COVID-19 cases on March 18, 2020, is 67,800, close to its simulation value 67,680.39 (Table 1) . To fit the model for COVID-19, we selected four provinces with severe epidemics: Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Henan. The statistical profile changed on February 13 when the method of establishing confirmed cases was changed from diagnosis of COVID-19 by nucleic  Infection, Genetics and Evolution 82 (2020) 104306 acid test to clinical diagnosis, which resulted in a jump in the number of confirmed cases. A total of 14,840 new cases were confirmed in Hubei on February 13. Therefore, Fig. 2 shows a jump in the cumulative number of cases on February 13. In general, the model fitting effect of the four provinces is significant. The incidence of SARS cases in China is different from that of COVID-19. By March 18, 2020, a total of 80,894 cases of COVID-19 had occurred in China (data exclude Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), including 67,800 cases in Hubei, whose cumulative cases account for the majority of those in China. In 2003, SARS occurred in China, and there was no significant difference in the number of cases among the most severely affected provinces. Therefore, on a regional basis, we selected the number of cases in China (national data), Guangdong, Beijing, and Hong Kong. The fitting results are shown in Fig. 3 , and the fitting effect is also significant. Saudi Arabia experienced four distinct cycles of MERS outbreaks. The model fitting of MERS cases in these four cycles is shown in Fig. 4 . The largest average relative error of the four cycles is in the second cycle (3.07%), and the overall fitting effect is reasonable. The growth rate r 0 mainly reflects the natural transmission of an infectious disease, which is affected by a number of factors, including the infectivity of the virus itself, population flow, and public health quality. Although population density can also affect the spread of infectious diseases, its influence is not very obvious. For the growth rate r 0 of COVID-19, it can be seen from the first graph of Fig. 5 that the growth rates of Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Henan are between 0.2 and 0.32, with an average of 0.281. The differences among them are not very obvious. In the case of SARS, the second graph of Fig. 5 shows that the growth rate of Beijing is about twice that of Hong Kong. The growth rates of the MERS virus in the four cycles in Saudi Arabia were not significantly different, with an average of 0.106, as shown in the third graph of Fig. 5 . The fourth graph of Fig. 5 compares the transmissibility of the three coronaviruses. The growth rate of COVID-19 is significantly higher than those of SARS and MERS, and is about twice that of SARS, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. That is why the COVID-19 outbreak is growing much faster than the SARS and MERS outbreaks. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the multiplication cycles of SARS and MERS are similar, ranging from 5 to 10 days. For SARS, this is 95, 36.94, 110.97, 135.22, and F-Statistics are 14525.04, 54763.65, 15502.61, 69710.64, respectively. consistent with a culture cycle of 2 to 7 days for the SARS. The multiplication cycle of COVID-19 is only two to three days, and the number of cases of COVID-19 will increase rapidly under the effect of exponential growth. The infection inhibition constant s is related to some human intervention factors, mainly including the isolation of infected people, the isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, the public's attention to infectious diseases, and the cleaning and disinfection of epidemic areas. These human intervention measures are closely related to the measures taken by local governments and medical institutions after the outbreak, and they reflect the emergency management capabilities of government departments and medical and health departments. In principle, vaccines are part of the human intervention, but there is no vaccine for any of the three coronaviruses. The larger the infection suppression constant s, the timelier and more effective are human intervention measures, and the easier it is to control the outbreak in a short time. Otherwise, the outbreak is more likely to get out of control. The three pneumonias, COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, show significant differences in infection inhibition constants (Fig. 7) . For SARS, the differences of the infection inhibition constants among the Chinese mainland, Guangdong, Beijing, and Hong Kong are not significant, and their infection inhibition constants are all on the order of 10 −5 . The constants of Guangdong and Beijing are almost the same, about twice that of mainland China. The infectious inhibition constant of MERS is an order of magnitude higher than that of SARS, at 10 −4 , and the constants for the first to fourth cycle are almost gradually increasing, indicating that Saudi Arabia took stronger emergency intervention measures in subsequent outbreak cycles to stop the transmission of the MERS virus. In Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Henan, the infection inhibition constants of COVID-19 have the same order of magnitude as those of MERS. In Hubei, however, the infection inhibition constant of COVID-19 is 3.58 × 10 −6 , two orders of magnitude lower than in Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Henan. That is why COVID-19 grew out of control in Hubei in the early stage. Of course, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Henan have much higher infection inhibition constants than Hubei, thanks to the strong closure measures taken by Hubei. At the beginning of 2020, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Henan launched a first-level response to public health emergencies, causing government authorities, health authorities, and the public to take more active measures. The vast majority of Chinese provinces and cities finally started the firstlevel response to public health emergencies, requiring people to stay in quarantine at home, to wear masks outside, and to improve personal hygiene. As for Hubei province, due to the large number of patients in the early stage, medical institutions could not cope with the shortage of hospital beds, equipment, medicine, masks, protective clothing, and other materials, resulting in the inability to effectively isolate patients, which led to a significantly higher infection inhibition constant in Hubei province. Later, Hubei province adopted more stringent control measures, such as that two AD hoc hospitals were established for the treatment of COVID-19, several cabin hospitals were established for the treatment of mild or asymptomatic patients, and communities were closed. Infection, Genetics and Evolution 82 (2020) 104306 characteristics of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS. The growth rate of infectious diseases determines their prevalence in the early stage, and the infection inhibition constant depends on the prevention and control measures adopted by different regions. The parameter analysis of the three coronavirus dynamics models reasonably explains the characteristics of their transmission and the measures taken in different places during the outbreak. The growth rate of COVID-19 is much higher than that of SARS and MERS, with a doubling period about half of theirs. The infection inhibition constant of COVID-19 in Hubei is two orders of magnitude lower than in other regions, making the outbreak situation of Hubei much more severe. All the contributions of this manuscript, including conceptualization, modelling, software, data analysis, figure drawing, writing, editing, are finished by Kaihao Liang. The authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.@story_separate@In this paper, a dynamic mathematical model of infectious diseases was established, and the model was used to analyze the epidemic","The purpose of this paper is to reveal the spread rules of the three pneumonia: COVID-19, SARS and MERS. We compare the new spread characteristics of COVID-19 with those of SARS and MERS. By considering the growth rate and inhibition constant of infectious diseases, their propagation growth model is established. The parameters of the three coronavirus transmission growth models are obtained by nonlinear fitting. Parametric analysis shows that the growth rate of COVID-19 is about twice that of the SARS and MERS, and the COVID-19 doubling cycle is two to three days, suggesting that the number of COVID-19 patients would double in two to three days without human intervention. The infection inhibition constant in Hubei is two orders of magnitude lower than in other regions, which reasonably explains the situation of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei."
"As a great threat to human life and health (Ali et al., 2020; Wu and McGoogan, 2020) , the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide has transmitted rapidly, killing a high number of elderly persons and adults with existing health problems (Gates, 2020) . Obviously, global health systems were underprepared for any significant outbreaks despite considerable progress (Bedford et al., 2019) . The global prevention and control of COVID-19 has consumed extensive medical resources, leading to a serious shortage of health capital (Quigley et al., 2020) . Fortunately, several countries have quickly responded to this dilemma with smart measures. For example, New York University School of Medicine and Columbia University encouraged their medical students to graduate ahead of time to participate in the prevention and control of the epidemic 1 . In fact, a large number of medical students have contributed to the overall process of social prevention and control by participating in various efforts and actions such as case data visualization (Dong et al., 2020) , psychological counseling (Jun et al., 2020) , translating the latest articles, and compiling epidemiological survey records 2 . As a result, the value of medical students who provide voluntary services during public health emergencies has been recognized for the first time in the field of medical education. Indeed, there is a lack of attention focusing on training aspects of students' volunteer service ability in traditional medical education. In particular, there is a lack of platforms and channels to support medical students in providing volunteer services. Under the background of public health emergencies, health service workers faced overload work, the challenge of health resources serious scarce, more social participation and support is required (Li et al., 2020) , this study focused on the medical students to participate in volunteer service real attitude, motivation and incentive mechanism research, the academic research helps to improve college students volunteer service incentive mechanism. As a type of long-term free assistance, volunteer behavior (VB) refers to individuals voluntarily responding to those who actively seek help, after careful consideration under special circumstances (Snyder and Omoto, 2010) . Although there are many different discussions regarding the definition of VB among scholars, the main characteristics of voluntary service include being voluntary, free, related to public welfare, and altruistic. As a valuable group due to their high professionalization, medical students can play a beneficial role in the field of voluntary service, especially in the area of health promotion (Yan et al., 2014) . Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to encourage medical students to provide volunteer services. Of course, research on medical students' VB as well as its antecedent factors and functional mechanisms is also necessary. Numerous empirical studies showed that females, junior students, students with a positive attitude, and students with relevant volunteer service experience are more willing to participate in volunteer service activities (Ueda, 2011) . However, in the medical field, we need to break the stereotype of female students and explore the real motivation behind the VB of female medical students, which is also conducive to supplement the theoretical knowledge of voluntary service. More specifically, on a theoretical level, based on a functional perspective of ""needs-motivation-behavior"" (Omoto and Snyder, 1995) , VB has the function of realizing a person's specific motivation, which explains why individuals tend to participate in volunteer service activities. As an internal force, prosocial motivation (PM) refers to an individual's desire for action based on the consideration of helping and contributing to others (Grant, 2007) , which leads to VB. PM mainly involves a willingness to care for others, build good interpersonal communication, and help others in a crisis (Grant and Sumanth, 2009 ). In the COVID-19 epidemic, many medical students have actively engaged in voluntary activities, such as providing online consultations, prescreening and triage, and spreading health knowledge. Thus, we suppose that these initiatives implemented by volunteer medical students may have been inspired by their high PM. In particular, the professional nature of medical students is to cure the disease and save people. The public welfare and dedication are deeply rooted in the learning career of medical students (Kenyon and Brown, 2007) . Therefore, we proposed Hypothesis 1 (H1): the PM of medical students has a positive impact on VB. By integrating various theories, Matsuba et al. (2007) established a multi-factor model in which VB is the result of multiple factors. In their model, influencing factors of VB are divided into persistent and regulatory factors. Persistent factors comprise a series of stable traits including personality, socio-economic and cultural characteristics, and those factors that indirectly affect individual VB. On the contrary, regulatory factors include moral cognition, identity, and opportunity among others. Moral cognition and identity, as individual internal selfcognition factors, can urge volunteer service directly (Cornelis et al., 2013) . Calling and vocation (CV) is a common internal stable trait of medical students that refers to a series of subjective perceptions related to their career role or career expectations, including personal core value, sense of meaning and goal, selfexpression, and social contribution (Behavior, 2010) . Especially under the guidance of the core idea of ""benevolence"" in Chinese traditional Confucian culture, medical students with higher CV tend to exhibit a stronger emotional attachment to society by offering medical services (Zhou and Reisach, 2020) . When medical staff faces the dilemma of shortage caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, medical students are prone to experience volunteer motivation under the high-powered incentive of CV (Liu shan, 2005) . As a consequence, we guess that medical students with high-level CV are more likely to actively assist medical workers to carry out activities of prevention and control of COVID-19. Calling and vocation has been conceptualized as a guiding force that can boost a series of aspiring career behaviors. Zhang et al. (2015) pointed out that this guiding force includes five elements: sense of responsibility, vision, common expectation, belief, and following destiny. Vision and following destiny both can be seen as external inspiration, while sense of responsibility, belief, and common expectation together emphasize internal drive. As a positive predictor of altruistic behavior (Huang, 2016) , sense of responsibility refers to a relatively stable psychological quality by which individuals actively devote themselves to social public service or helping others. Related research indicated that specific social situations can trigger VB (Gebauer et al., 2008) , including social context, economy, culture, and other factors. In Eastern cultures, VB is often encouraged by a sense of community, while in countries with individualistic cultures, it is impelled by individuals' sense of social responsibility (SR) (Snyder and Omoto, 2010) . China's social ethos collide and blend with each other and form tension between each other, which has unprecedentedly aroused public attention and thinking on topics such as democracy and the rule of law, rumors and truth, freedom and equality, individual values and public interests (Jia lizheng and Yanzhuo, 2020). It is possible that higher CV and SR among medical students may have a positive effect on VB during the COVID-19 outbreak. In view of the above, the current study aimed to investigate the functional mechanism between prosocial behavior of medical students and their VB. Therefore, we proposed Hypothesis 2 (H2): medical students' CV and SR together play a chain-mediating role in the influence of PM on VB.@story_separate@Study I: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an anonymous online questionnaire with medical students across 10 Chinese provinces (Henan, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hebei, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, etc.). A total of 3,741 participants were recruited. Finally, 2,454 valid questionnaires were used for analysis, yielding an effective response rate of 65.60%. The inclusion criteria for this study included being a full-time college medical student and providing informed consent for voluntary participation. Exclusion criteria included voluntarily choosing not to participate in our study, having an online answering time <4 min, and returning questionnaires with missing items or obvious errors. Study II: In this study, 28 interviewees were selected in medical colleges, including 23 Medical Students and 5 teachers. There were 12 males and 16 females. The average age was 25.5 years. All respondents have organized or participated in volunteer service. There were 18 students who participated in the volunteer service of the COVID-19 epidemic situation. The specific voluntary service mainly included health knowledge publicity, psychological counseling, community residents registration, and nucleic acid detection. Study I: The anonymous online questionnaire was completed by Chinese medical students throughout the country from April 1 to 19, 2020. With the use of a multistage stratified sampling method was employed, using an open online questionnaire for students from different medical schools (10 medical colleges in China's central, Eastern and Western Regions). A web page link to our questionnaire survey 3 was sent via mobile phone to the participants. Students who saw it and were willing to participate could fill it out via mobile phone or computer during their free time. The registered users of the questionnaire (researchers) monitored the collected questionnaires in real time and effectively managed the data using this platform. In the past, our team has successfully used this survey method to complete a series of studies (Zhang et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018a,b) . Study II: This study constructs the category and significance of voluntary service motivation according to the research method of root theory (Charmaz, 2000) . Semi structured interviews were conducted from October 15 to November 5 to collect data, and collected data in the form of recording and written question and answer questions after obtaining the consent of the interviewee. The core questions of the interview included ""How did you participate in volunteer service activities?"" ""What are the reasons why you participated in the volunteer service for this new outbreak?"" In order to find out the interviewees' experience of participating in volunteer activities, we continued to ask the interviewees' answers. In the qualitative interview, questions such as ""evaluation of the VB"" were set up to supplement the purpose of participating in volunteer service and the benefits to be obtained in the end from the perspective of harvest. We converted the recording manuscript into a written manuscript word by word after the interview. The study was conducted in compliance with the ethical guidelines of the Ethics Committee of the College of Public Health, Harbin Medical University (HMUIRB20200315), and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Harbin Medical University. It was not possible to seek written informed consent from the participants because of the anonymous survey approach. However, on the front page of the questionnaire, we clearly clarified that the survey was anonymous. Hence, once a questionnaire was completed and submitted successfully, we assumed the consent of the medical student to participate in our investigation. The survey was divided into two parts: the first part included demographic information for medical students (gender, age, education level, major type, grade, the experience of leadership cadres, registered residence, and family monthly income). The second part includes PM scale, brief calling scale (BCS), student personal responsibility scale, and voluntary behavior scale. To measure prosocial work motivation, five items developed by Grant (2008) were utilized in the present study. We revised the items' wording according to the COVID-19 epidemic situation. Participants were instructed to rate the extent to which each of five statements (e.g., During the period of fighting against the epidemic, I prefer to do some work to increasing the positive influence on others) was true of them, using a seven-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). The total score was computed to quantify the respondent's overall level of PM. The higher the total score, the higher the PM level of medical students. Cronbach's alpha for this scale was 0.915. Calling and vocation was evaluated with the BCS, which consists of four items (Dik et al., 2012) : ""I still regard my career in medicine and the health industry as a strong pursuit to achieve my life goals even if I know the danger of the epidemic""; ""I have a good understanding of my calling as it applies to my career""; ""In the wake of this outbreak, I begin to try to figure out what my mission would be in my future medical career""; and ""I know the responsibilities of medical workers. In my future career, I will go to the front without hesitation if I face the epidemic again."" Items were scored on a five-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 to 5 (1 = not at all true of me, 2 = mildly true of me, 3 = moderately true of me, 4 = mostly true of me, 5 = totally true of me). Thus, higher scores indicated higher CV. Cronbach's alpha for this scale was 0.898. In this study, a SR scale for medical students was developed by referring to the Student Personal Responsibility Scale (SPRS-10) by Singg and Ader (2001) . Partial items such as ""If my teacher gives me a volunteer task during the epidemic prevention and control period, I will start to complete it immediately, "" ""During the epidemic, I could think independently and help my family and friends learn scientific knowledge of epidemic prevention to avoid being misled by rumors"" and ""I believe that COVID-19 prevention and control is the task of countries, health care workers and others."" Participants were requested to rate their SR on a five-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree), with higher scores indicating higher SR. Cronbach's alpha for this scale was 0.789. Voluntary behavior was evaluated with four items compiled by Carlo (Carlo et al., 2005) . ""In the past, have you participated in voluntary activities?"" ""Are you currently participating in volunteer activities?"" and ""Are you going to take part in voluntary activities in the future?"" were answered as no = 1 or yes = 2; ""In the next year, how likely are you to take part in voluntary activities?"" was answered as a number from 0 to 7, which represented the size of the possibility of volunteering. The higher the total score of these items, the higher the likelihood of voluntary behavior. Erez's research verified the validity of this questionnaire (Erez et al., 2008) . Descriptive statistics were used to inspect the demographic characteristics of participants. The correlations between variables (PM, CV, SR, and VB) were examined using Pearson's correlation coefficient. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp, BM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY, United States). Statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed P-value < 0.05. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to test the chain-mediation effects. The chain intermediary mechanism was investigated with the SPSS macro PROCESS provided by Preacher and Hayes (Hayes, 2013a) , and Model 6 was executed. The chain intermediary analyses were based on bootstrapping (5,000 bootstrap samples) using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The macro PROCESS was used for calculating and testing the direct and indirect effects. The mediation mechanism is significant when the 95% CI does not include 0. Gender, age, education level, grade, major type, family monthly income, and experience of leadership cadre among medical students were included as control variables (Singg and Ader, 2001; Matsuba et al., 2007) . Step 1: we encode all the text materials with words as the basic unit. That is to say, taking words as the basic unit, not omitting any important information, using the original words and sentences of interviewees as the basis of concept classification as far as possible, and comparing the open codes repeatedly until they are saturated. Step 2: we discover and establish various generic relationships among conceptual genera in the process of relational coding login. While analyzing the relevance of conceptual categories and exploring the relationship between them, we also explore the volunteer intention and motivation of the interviewees, and put their words into the context of the time and their social and cultural background. Step 3: We analyzed the correlation coding in the previous step and carried out the generic analysis. The core code occupies the central position of all genera and becomes the core of the data. It is easy to connect with other genera and is easy to be summarized as theory. This method of analyzing qualitative data has been widely used in numerous studies (Howell, 2009; Mulholland et al., 2019) . Table 1 . The majority of the sample was female (74.8%). Participants aged 20-21 accounted for half of the sample (55.22%). Almost all participants were undergraduates (91.93%), with a clinical medicine major (21.1%). Third-year undergraduate students were the most numerous (31.8%), compared with other grades. Participants who had experience of leadership cadre among medical students (51.5%) were slightly more numerous than those with no experience (48.5%). Furthermore, the number of participants was basically the same for urban areas (45.8%) and rural areas (54.2%). Moreover, 38.4% had a family monthly income within 2,001-5,000 RMB. Score means and SDs, and internal consistencies for all the measures were computed. Pearson's correlation coefficients for continuous variables are shown in Table 2 . All variables were significantly correlated with each other. PM was positively correlated with CV (r = 0.589, P < 0.01), SR (r = 0.591, P < 0.01), and VB (r = 0.445, P < 0.01). Moreover, CV was positively correlated with SR (r = 0.553, P < 0.01) and VB (r = 0.430, P < 0.01). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between SR and VB (r = 0.389, P < 0.01). The results of the chain-mediation analysis are summarized in Table 3 . Model 6 in the model library developed by Hayes (2013b) was executed with the SPSS macro PROCESS. First, in this analysis, gender, age, education level, grade, major type, family monthly income, and experience of leadership cadre were treated as control variables in the regression equations. A model was constructed with CV (M1) as a mediator and SR (M2) as another mediator. In this model, PM was set as the predictor (X) and VB as the outcome (Y). We used 5,000 bootstrap samples and determined the mediating effect using 95% CIs. The results showed that X had a significant positive predictive effect on Y (β = 0.098, P < 0.001), and H1 was thus supported. Moreover, the indirect effect of X on Y was significant (lower limit CI = 0.069, upper limit CI = 0.099). Therefore, CV and SR played a chainmediating role in the relationship between PM (X) and VB intention (Y) among medical students; H2 was thus supported. The chain-mediation model is shown in Figure 1 . According to the three-level coding analysis (Table 4 ), this study found that the generation of volunteer service behavior is affected by many factors. It mainly includes the motivation of volunteers and volunteer network. The motivation mainly includes altruistic motivation, PM, self-moral cognition and incentive factors. The voluntary network mainly includes school, social and network channels. The 18 students who participated in the prevention and control of COVID-19 volunteers had different experiences, including positive volunteer service experience and negative volunteer service experience, as well as the negative impact of these experiences on medical students. We found that medical students with high PM engaged in more frequent VB during the COVID-19 outbreak, which is similar to the results of a previous study conducted among college students in the United States (Carlo et al., 2005) . A survey on volunteers with a long-term follow-up by Snyder also supported the same viewpoint that individual motivation directly affects VB (Gebauer et al., 2008) , most of the students with high PM will continue to participate in volunteer activities in the future, even if the previous volunteer service experience is not perfect, the results of this qualitative interview are consistent with the above research. All respondents said that they will still participate in different types of volunteer services in the future, once there is a suitable time and opportunity. Meanwhile, Grant argued that individual PM regarded as a kind of current psychological state is usually aroused by the desire to help others, thereby leading individuals to focus on their internal motivation to protect and improve the welfare of others (Grant, 2008) . Because individual PM can be stimulated in a disaster scenario, medical students will consider how they can contribute to fighting against the epidemic. For example, Some college students in China have volunteered to serve as tutors for the children of medical workers in order to help medical workers relieve part of their family burden. Although these students do not contribute directly to the medical field, they also indirectly help health care workers to have more energy to fight the COVID-19 epidemic. In the qualitative interview, we found that female students are more likely to expand their interpersonal network and practice ability by participating in volunteer service, so as to make their future career more smooth. Previous studies have divided PM of employees into three levels based on the basic framework of psychological motivation research (Clary et al., 1998; Grant and Berry, 2011; Hu et al., 2013) . First, global PM, as a relatively stable personality tendency, refers to employees with high-degree intrinsically prosocial values who tend to attach importance to protecting and There is a big gap between the actual work and the expected work, Policy coordination Negative influence increasing the overall welfare of others. Second, contextual PM refers to employees who want to help specific groups in a unique situation (natural disasters, infectious diseases, etc.). For instance, employees resort to their professional roles to help others during work. In the stage of fighting COVID-19, Chinese virtues such as fearless sacrifice, courage to take responsibility, selfless dedication, solidarity and mutual assistance have been fully demonstrated and carried forward, reflecting that the spiritual quality of the whole nation has risen to a new level (Anlong, 2020) . Third, situational PM represents a more specific and dynamic trait (Berg and Grant, 2012) ; For example, doctors and nurses perform duties during major public health emergencies. To sum up, we can assume that both contextual and situational PM lead medical students to engage in prosocial behavior after considering the containment practices for the COVID-19 epidemic. Considering the suggestion that volunteer experiences are prone to trigger further realization of individuals' initial motivation (Hu et al., 2013) , medical students with satisfactory volunteer experiences will be significantly more likely to engage in VB in the future (Clary et al., 1998) . Therefore, educators in medical colleges need to pay attention to the management of students' volunteer service by building a continuous volunteer service system, so as to provide a platform for further promoting medical students' PM. The current study verified a chain-mediating effect of the CV and SR of medical students on the relationship between PM and VB, consistent with previous scholars' conclusions (Matsuba et al., 2007) . Of course, a series of antecedents as essential conditions for triggering individual VB are inevitable, while the process variables determine their trend of occurrence and development (Jaffe et al., 2010; Liu and Zhao, 2016; Shi et al., 2017) . Matsuba suggested that the intermediary factors in the relationship between antecedents and VB mainly included individual moral cognition, self-identity, and opportunity (Matsuba et al., 2007) . Snyder posed that volunteering is not only a behavior but also a part of identity that reflects the goals and significance of many people's lives (Snyder, 2001) . The results of qualitative interviews supplement this view, the identity of medical students makes medical students have empathy for the working state of medical staff. They are more willing to help medical staff and society to contribute their ""strength."" Whether it is medical related work or other public services, their inner PM and SR drive them to actively participate in volunteer service. According to the role identity model, Grube (2000) suggested that individual role identity was a determinant factor in the process of VB; in particular, the factors of self-recognition and identity in volunteer activities were described as important components of self-identity. More specifically, if individuals realize the value of their volunteer work, they tend to be satisfied with the experience or regard ""volunteering"" as a part of their identity, which leads to them becoming highly integrated with volunteer service organizations (Penner et al., 2005) . In addition, respondents also proposed medical students' CV for a career in medicine increases their sense of identity as health care providers after undergoing their training for professional knowledge and practice skills. When the whole society urgently needs medical workers to participate in containing the epidemic, as a motivator, this situation is likely to arouse medical students' sense of SR, PM, and altruism by increasing their CV to maintain the safety and health of the population. It is worth mentioning that the written proof of voluntary service and interpersonal network are also the incentive factors to encourage medical students to participate in voluntary service. The Hippocratic oath (Sher, 1996) , as the value driver for medical students, often inspires them to engage in voluntary service and help people to avoid the COVID-19 threat. For instance, the College Student Volunteer and Medical Staff Family Pairing Program initiated by Chinese college students established a service team during the epidemic to help the offspring of medical staff with coaching lessons. The interviewed medical students and teachers also said that participating in volunteer activities is conducive to improving medical students' self-identity and quality education in schools. Moreover, medical students in different regions contribute to various kinds of services, such as interpretation of national epidemic prevention policies, helping the poor, providing psychological counseling, and organizing donations. These voluntary behaviors not only exhibit the expertise of medical students but also cultivate their practical ability to serve society. Therefore, educators in medical colleges need to attach importance to fostering the enthusiasm of medical students' for volunteering. Meanwhile, policymakers in the government and public organizations need to positively create various platforms for providing more job opportunities to motivate medical students' volunteer services. This study explained the functional mechanism between PM in medical students and their VB, specifically indicating that CV and SR play a mediating role in this link. Findings from research on the chain-mediating effect also highlighted the process of generation and reinforcement of VB of medical students (liang, 2013), further clarifying the role of PM in the mechanism of voluntary service. In sum, our findings highlight that medical education organizations should pay attention to cultivating students' sense of SR and offer more job opportunities for medical students to contribute to volunteer services during their study period. Besides, volunteering in the medical service industry must be paid enough attention at both academic and practical levels in the future. Although the present study yielded significant results, several limitations must be mentioned. First, the non-random sampling network survey method potentially causes sample bias, which can affect the study results. The questionnaire distribution method used in this study may also lead to potential but incalculable sample size bias. Second, the cross-sectional nature prevented the establishment of a causal relationship between the variables. Therefore, one important suggestion is that longitudinal studies should be conducted in the future. Third, data were self-reported, which may lead to potential errors caused by memory bias. What's more, this study uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative research to minimize the bias of the research results, but some subtle issues such as social approval still have certain limitations on the research results. There are also issues of political correctness and need of acceptance in the medical field. These limitations need to be addressed in future research. The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. The study was conducted in compliance with the ethical guidelines of the Ethics Committee of the College of Public Health, Harbin Medical University (HMUIRB20200315), and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Harbin Medical University. It was not possible to seek written informed consent from the participants because of the anonymous survey approach. However, on the front page of the questionnaire, we clearly clarified that the survey was anonymous. Hence, once a questionnaire was completed and submitted successfully, we assumed the consent of the medical student to participate in our investigation. YS conceptualized and designed the study with assistance from LH F and TS. YS and S-E Z performed the quantitative analysis. YS wrote the manuscript, recruited the survey respondents. All authors have reviewed and approved the manuscript prior to submission. Funding was provided by the Harbin Medical University Graduate Innovation Fund and Special subject of ""epidemic situation and education"" of Education Science Planning of Zhejiang Province, 2020yqjy88.@story_separate@In order to avoid the risk of infection involved in face-to-face surveys, a total of 2,454 medical students were surveyed using an online questionnaire. Data on PM, CV, SR, and VB were collected through self-report. Qualitative interviews were also carried out after the opening of Chinese schools. A total of 28 teachers and students participated. The results indicated that greater PM in medical students can positively predict more frequent VB. Moreover, CV and SR played a chain-mediating role in the relationship between PM and VB. In other words, medical students with high PM will have greater SR by increasing their CV, which further triggers subsequent VB. The results of the qualitative interview further enriched the research content of the questionnaire, and explored the deeper motivation and feelings of medical students to participate in volunteer activities. Finally, we propose that governments, non-profit organizations, public welfare organizations, and medical colleges need to pay more attention to foster students' CV and SR. All-level organizations should contribute to jointly provide rich job opportunities and platforms for generating volunteer services for medical students, and need to build a sustainable incentive system to encourage medical students to engage in VBs to serve society.","After the COVID-19 outbreak, the health status of the general population has suffered a huge threat, and the health system has also encountered great challenges. As critical members of human capital in the health sector, medical students with specialized knowledge and skills have positively fought against the epidemic by providing volunteer services that boosted the resilience of the health system. Although volunteer behavior (VB) is associated with individual internal motivation, there is sparse evidence on this relationship among medical students, especially regarding potential mechanisms. Therefore, this study had two main objectives: (1) to examine the influence of prosocial motivation (PM) of medical students on their VB; and (2) to verify the chain-mediating role of calling and vocation (CV) as well as social responsibility (SR) in the relationship between PM and VB. Study I: a total of 2454 Chinese full-time medical students were invited to complete an online survey. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression analysis. The results demonstrated that PM significantly affected VB in medical students (β = 0.098, P < 0.001); CV as well as SR chain-mediated the relationship between PM and VB (β = 0.084, P < 0.001). PM promoted the formation of SR by positively evoking CV of medical students, further resulting in increased VB. Study II: A 28 person qualitative interview was conducted. Qualitative data are added to reduce the limitations of online questionnaires. At the same time, we can also critically study the VB of Chinese medical students during COVID-19. The results showed that there were various reasons for medical students to volunteer in the process of fighting against COVID-19, and the experience of volunteer service and the impact on their future life were different. Lastly, the current findings suggest that fostering volunteerism among medical students requires the joint effort of the government, non-profit organizations, and medical colleges."
"In this modern age, pandemics are not a rare phenomenon. As in the last decade, we have seen several pandemics such as H1N1, SARS, EBOLA, and presently in 2020 humanity is facing its biggest crisis due to COVID-19. The severity of these pandemics can be understood by the death toll claimed by them. According to WHO, the pandemic H1N1/09 virus resulted in 18,036 deaths [1] . On the other hand, the CDC estimate between 151,700 to 575,400 deaths due to the pandemic H1N1/09 virus [2] . Currently, the coronavirus (COVID- 19) pandemic, which started in December 2019 from Wuhan, China has infected 2,404,249 individuals and claimed 165,229 (as of 20 th April 2020) deaths worldwide [3] [4] . Pandemics are different from epidemics in terms of their geographic spread. An epidemic affects many people at the same time. It spreads from person to person and remains local to a specific region. In comparison, when an epidemic engulfs an entire country, continent, or the whole world, it is termed as pandemic. In the past, various models have been proposed for understanding the epidemic spreads. These models can be broadly classified into two categories, that is agent-based modeling [5] [6] [7] and compartmental models [8] [9] [10] . The agent-based modeling is used for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents as a whole [11] . These agents can be both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups. In contrast, differential equations are used in compartmental models, where the population is divided into different compartments such as suspected (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) [8] . Several other variants of these models have also been proposed such as SI [12] , SIS [13] , SIR [8] , SIRS [14] , etc. Compartmental models are often being criticized by the agent-based model researchers because they struggle to capture the connectivity between different regions of the globe, and different real-world population characteristic, such as worldwide population distribution [15] [16] . In this study, we proposed a mobility-based model, an extension to the classical SIR based epidemic model, which considers the realworld population distribution across different regions of the world. Most importantly, the model also takes into account the connectivity factor among various regions of the world, which is the key cause in accelerating the process of transforming epidemics into pandemics. We model the regions in a 2dimensional lattice, where each cell represents the mobility parameter (or direct connectivity) from one region to another. Along with presenting the mathematical proof of our model, we have performed extensive simulations on synthetic data and forecast the COVID-19 cases in Estonia 1 by inferring the interaction among individuals through call data records between Estonian counties to demonstrate the model's ability to generalize on different types of data. The proposed model is composed of (local) transmission rate of the infection β and to cover the mobility aspect, we introduce parameters: 1) 'α' which is a social connectivity parameter that signifies how well individuals are socially linked with each others, and 2) 'c (i,j) ' that represents individuals mobility from some region j to another region i. Thus, the infection can transfer within the region with the transmission rate β and can also be introduced from other regions through global transmission rate which depends upon α, c (i,j) , I j (fraction of infected at region j) and β. With the help of Figure  1 , we illustrate our proposed model for better understanding. We applied our model on synthetic network as well as on a real network of Estonia considering the population density and the connectivity among counties, which is created using call data records (CDR) to investigate the following questions: • How social connectivity parameter 'α' affects the fraction of individuals in different compartments (susceptible, infected and recovered) during a pandemic? We address this question by carefully examining the effect of α while keeping all the other parameters constant (Section IV-B). • What are the outcomes of restricting mobility from the top-X percentile of strongly connected regions? We explore the outcomes of mobility restriction with the model and found that restricting the mobility of top-10 percentile of connected regions can reduce the number of infected individuals between 18% to 27% (Section IV-B). • What is the relationship between social connectivity parameter 'α' and mobility restriction (of top-X percentile) of strongly connected regions? To address this question, we performed numerical simulation on the proposed mean-field equations (Section IV-B, Figure 4 ). • How efficiently this model can perform in real scenarios? We answer this question by projecting the expected COVID-19 cases in Estonia using the model and compared the results with the real cases (Section IV-B3). The limitation of classical compartmental epidemiological models is that they do not take into account the importance of reducing social connectivity (or isolation) and the significance of mobility restriction during the spreading of a pandemic such as COVID-19. This limitation is overcome in the proposed model. We found that the reproduction number R 0 for a pandemic depends upon the social connectivity and mobility parameter. We also discovered that during a pandemic, restricting mobility reduces the fraction of individuals in an infected compartment and reducing the social connectivity (or isolation) delays the peak and also reduces the number of infected individuals from the pandemic. We believe that this model can help to adopt a balanced strategy to address a pandemic crisis. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Next, we discuss related works with respect to epidemic modeling. We then describe the model preliminaries and derivations in Section III. Section IV presents the evaluation results of our model and we conclude with a discussion of future directions in Section V.@story_separate@In this section, we discuss relevant literature with respect to epidemic modeling which involves two different lines of work. First involving agent-based modeling and the second using compartmental based modeling. In the agent-based modeling, authors model epidemics by simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view of assessing their effects on the system as a whole [11] by using transportation systems such as road networks [16] , airways [15] etc. These models have been used for understanding various epidemics such as smallpox [17] , influenza [18] , cholera [19] , and very recently about COVID-19 [15] . In contrast to agent-based modeling, a differential equation based compartmental models have also been used for understanding epidemics, which is the basis of this work. This line of literature is mainly based on the classical SIR model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick [8] followed by [20] [21] . In [20] , the authors considered the host population as a dynamic variable rather than constant, as conventionally assumed, which provides a broader understanding of the population behavior during infectious disease. In their work in [21] , authors discuss the idea of the basic reproductive rate, threshold about host densities, and modes of transmission. Different variations of SIR model have also been proposed to capture various real-world scenarios. For example, introducing a delay in the model to capture the incubation period during the spreading [22] - [25] or the introduction of interventions such as antiviral drugs [26] . In a different work to represent non-linear nature of epidemic spread, a SIR rumor spreading model was proposed in which tie strengths were dependent on nodes' degree [27] . Apart from SIR based models, there exist different flavors of compartmental models, which represent different scenarios such as SIS [13] , where individuals do not recover and can become susceptible again. This model has also been studied using varying types of underlying topologies [28] . A set of works has also focused on exhibiting the epidemic spreading by using varying types of underlying network structures. For example, authors in [29] , [30] and [31] used a scale-free network and in [32] a small-world evolving networks for evaluating their epidemiological framework. In their work in [33] , authors combine a discrete, stochastic SEIR (E stands for exposed) model with a three-scale community network model to demonstrate that the different regional trends may be explained by different community mixing rates. A detailed study with respect to various epidemic models on varying topologies has been done in [34] . In another line of work, authors proposed models to understand epidemics based on the speed of growth. For example, in [35] , authors applied their generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an outbreak on 20 different epidemics. Their findings revealed that sub-exponential growth is a common phenomenon, especially for pathogens that are not airborne. In another work [36] , researchers explain the rapid spread of H1N1 in 2009 around the world by using a flexible Bayesian, space-time, Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) modeling approach. [37] developed a simulation model of a pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak in a structured population using demographic data from a medium-sized city in Ontario and epidemiologic influenza pandemic data. In comparison to previous works, the proposed model introduces mobility and social connectivity parameters, the key characteristics for turning epidemics into pandemics.  In this section, we first explain the classical SIR model and then discuss its limitations with respect to the absence of mobility and social connectivity parameters. Next, we describe our proposed model to understand the spreading of an infection during a pandemic. In 1926, Kermack and McKendrick [8] proposed the clas-sical SIR model as follows: where, s(t), i(t), r(t) is the fraction of susceptible, infected and recovered population at time t. However, the classical SIR epidemic model does not consider the heterogeneity and topology of the real-world network. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the mobility and social connectivity parameters in our proposed model. Let, 'l' represents the total number of locations and 'c' denotes the connection (or individuals' mobility) between locations. The propagation of infection at each location is explained as: Each healthy individual can get the infection either from an infected individual located in the same location (local transmission) or from an individual visiting from other connected locations (global transmission). The local transmission rate of infection is represented by β and the recovery rate as µ and, β and µ ∈ [0,1]. In the next section, we discuss the local transmission of infection and then the global transmission is discussed in detail in the Section III-B.  Let, j (j ⊂ l) represents a set of locations, which are connected to location i. Therefore, j N j is the maximum possible number of individuals connected to location i, from all the locations j. The parameter c i,j reflects the mobility of individuals from locations j to location i. Global transmission depends upon this mobility parameter of individuals from one location to another. Similar to local transmission, I j is the number of individuals in infected compartment in all the locations j. Hence, total mobility of infected individuals from all the other connected locations to location i is j c i,j Ij Nj . Considering the above description, the chances of transmission of infection from all the connected locations to location i is j c i,j Ij Nj β. This transmission further depends upon the social connectivity (α) of individuals at location i. Therefore, the proportion of healthy individuals at location i which can get infected from infected individuals from location j is α j ci,j I j N j β Ni+ j ci,j . Thus, the mean-field equations for the dynamics of the pandemic, based on the above discussed interactions: Where, Eq. 4 describes the rate of change of susceptible individuals at location i, and Eq. 5 refers to rate of change of infected individuals, and Eq. 6 explains the rate of change of recovered individuals at location i. Please refer Table I for notations and their meaning. Eq. (4-6) represents nonlinear dynamical system of pandemic spreading, where at any time t, In order to solve mean-field Eq. (4-6), following assumptions are made (Please note that these assumptions are not considered during our experiments): 1) Initially, the population at all locations is equal to N(t) at time t. 2) Individuals in infected compartments are equal to I(t) at all locations at time t and j I j = |j|.I j = kI j , where, k is the number of locations connected to location i, that is, k = |j|. location is a fraction of total population N . Let, the sum of fraction of population mobility from |k| locations is n. Then, the total individuals mobility from set of locations j to i is n * N . Therefore, j c i,j = nN . By considering the above assumptions, Eq. 4 and 6 can be written as From Eq. 8 and 9 For simplicity, Eq. 12 can be written as: Eq. 13 can be rewritten as Solving the Eq. 15, we get As pandemic arrives at steady state when t −→ ∞ hence dR dt = 0 and R ∞ = constant Let initial conditions are R(0) = 0, I(0) = I and S(0) = N − I ≈ N . Therefore, Eq. 17 can be written as Normalizing the Eq. 18 Therefore, the reproduction number R 0 is In case there is no social connectivity to other locations (α = 0 or k = 0 or n = 0) then the mobility SIR model will become the standard SIR model and the reproduction number is R 0 = β µ . Therefore, the reproduction number is directly proportional to social connectivity parameter α, number of connected locations k and depends upon individuals' mobility during a pandemic. In this section, we first explain our experimental setup and next, we discuss the results of our simulation conducted using the proposed model on synthetic networks. In addition, we also applied our model for predicting the real-time Estonian COVID-19 cases. For the analysis, we created an aggregated flow matrix of individuals per day from Origin to Destination (OD), which follows random distribution. Furthermore, three different techniques are considered for selecting the seed infection location: 1) Pandemics origin from a random location: In this, a random location is selected as seed infection location and a small fraction of individuals were infected at that location. 2) Pandemics origin from a weakly connected location: Here, seed location is selected strategically, which is weakly connected to other locations. That implies least mobility of individuals from this location to other locations. 3) Pandemics origin from a strongly connected location: In this also, seed location is selected strategically, which is strongly connected to other locations. This signifies that, highest mobility of individuals from this location to other locations. Our simulation is oriented towards addressing the following questions: • How social connectivity parameter 'α' affects the fraction of individuals in different compartments (susceptible, infected and recovered) during a pandemic? • What are the outcomes of restricting the mobility (for top-X percentile) of strongly connected locations? • What is the relationship between social connectivity parameter 'α' and the mobility restriction (top-X percentile of strongly connected locations? • How efficiently this model can perform in real scenarios? We answer this question by projecting the expected COVID-19 cases in Estonia. We perform various simulation experiments to explain the proposed model on OD network by using previously discussed techniques for selecting the seed infection location. It is to be noted that, if α = 0, then the model will behave as a standard SIR model. Also, if the mobility is reduced to 100 percentile (that is no mobility allowed) from strongly connected locations, then also model will act as a standard SIR model. the α decreases, and it also takes longer to reach its peak. This indicates that there is a positive impact of lock-down in controlling a pandemic. The effect of restricting the mobility from the top-X percentile of highly connected locations with other locations is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a to 3d displays the pandemic dynamics with different percentile of mobility restrictions of highly connected locations starting with 0% to 30% (keeping α = 0.5). We observe that in case of pandemic, restricting the mobility from the top-10 percentile of highly connected locations can reduce the number of individuals who can get infected to 27%. Therefore, quarantine plays a vital role during pandemics. In order to understand the relationship between α and mobility restriction from strongly connected locations, we performed the numerical simulation of the proposed mean-field equations (see Figure 4) . We can infer that social connectivity parameter 'α' and mobility both plays an important role during pandemics. Therefore, it is advisable to follow a dual strategy approach during a pandemic outbreak as controlling mobility reduces the fraction of infected individuals and α delays the peak. Furthermore, we analysed the number of days required to reach the point where highest fraction of individuals get infected (see Figure 5 ). This indicates that mobility restrictions and minimal social contact will postpone the pandemic's peak and will give sufficient time for the preparations especially for the health sector. 2) Pandemics Origin From a Weakly and Strongly Connected Locations: Fig. 6 displays the influence of the social communication parameter 'α' while keeping the other parameters constant for both weakly and strongly connected locations. Fig. 6a to 6l shows the pandemic dynamics with different values of α starting with α = 1 to α = 0.1. It can be noted that when a pandemic originates from a weakly connected location, it takes longer to reach its peak compared to when it starts from a strongly connected location. This shows that location of origin also plays an important role during pandemic. Similar to random location, reducing mobility from the highly connected locations by 10 percentile can reduce the number of infected individuals between 18% to 27% for weakly and strongly connected locations. To demonstrate the usability of the model, we applied it on a real-time data of Estonia's to fit COVID-19 cases. Fig. 7 shows the actual number of cases and the cases forecast by the model using different values for α and mobility percentile. For example, when alpha = 0.95, this indicates that social connectivity of individuals are reduced by 5% and also top-5% of strongly connected locations are restricted from mobility. Similarly, α = 0.7, implies that social connectivity of individuals are reduced by 30% and also the top-30% of strongly connected locations have introduced restricted mobility. For simulation, we created the OD matrix between counties of Estonia using call data records [38] . Furthermore, these call interactions are converted into population mobility between counties using Estonian population data [39] . For the local transmission of the virus (within the county), we consider the reproduction number R 0 = 2.5 [40] . Cases reported until 11 th March, 2020 are considered as initial condition for the model. The reason behind selecting 11 th March, 2020 as initial condition is that, till this date no local transmission of the virus was reported 2 . Till the day of initial condition, the Estonian Health Board confirmed 13 cases in Harju and two cases in Tartumaa and Saaremaa each 3 . During the simulation, the number of cases in all other counties are initialized to zero. The infection rate β and recovery rate µ are adjusted according to the value of R 0 for COVID-19. By 10 th April 2020, reported cases in Estonia and forecast cases using the model are shown in Fig. 7 . It can be noticed that the model predicted much higher cases of COVID-19 if no restrictions are introduced (α = 1). However, as the restrictions were introduced by the Government 4 the number of cases got damped (Actual). Thus, the applicability of this model is to forecast a range of predicted number of cases which can help the governmental and health agencies to understand the impact and introduce proportional interventions to restrict the spread of the epidemic.@story_separate@Classical compartmental epidemic models are unable to describe the spreading pattern of pandemics such as COVID-19 as they do not take into account the effect of social connectivity and mobility in spreading of the virus. Our proposed mobility based SIR model shows the significance of social connectivity and mobility during pandemics by taking into consideration the local and the global transmission rate of the infection. We have simulated the proposed model considering three different origins of the infection, namely random location, weakly connected location and strongly connected location. Our simulation shows that limiting the social connectivity reduces and delays the peak of the infected compartment. Our analysis also shows that restricting the mobility from the top-10 percentile of connected locations can reduce the number of infected individuals between 18% to 27%. From the mathematical proof for our proposed model, we obtained that the reproduction number R 0 directly depends upon social connectivity of individuals, number of connected locations and individuals mobility between locations which is in line with our simulations' results. This indicates that introducing isolation and quarantine is effective in fighting a pandemic crisis. Using the proposed model, we also simulated the real world scenario by considering the COVID-19 cases in Estonia. Simulation reveals that the mobility based SIR model can be helpful to forecast the expected number of cases after some proportion of isolation and quarantine is introduced in the society. We plan to include various future directions for this work such as by simulating the model using additional dynamic networks. Another direction would be to use additional mobility data such as transportation network for better understanding the pandemic behavior. Importantly, we plan to introduce infection delay and recovery delay simultaneously in our future studies.","In the last decade, humanity has faced many different pandemics such as SARS, H1N1, and presently novel coronavirus (COVID-19). On one side, scientists are focusing on vaccinations, and on the other side, there is a need to propose models that can help us in understanding the spread of these pandemics as it can help governmental and other concerned agencies to be well prepared, especially from pandemics, which spreads faster like COVID-19. The main reason for some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different regions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographical area, often worldwide. In addition, the population distribution and social coherence in the different regions of the world is non-uniform. Thus, once the epidemic enters a region, then the local population distribution plays an important role. Inspired by these ideas, we proposed a mobility-based SIR model for epidemics, which especially takes into account pandemic situations. To the best of our knowledge, this model is first of its kind, which takes into account the population distribution and connectivity of different geographic locations across the globe. In addition to presenting the mathematical proof of our model, we have performed extensive simulations using synthetic data to demonstrate our model's generalizability. To demonstrate the wider scope of our model, we used our model to forecast the COVID-19 cases for Estonia."
"Esophageal cancer is one of the most common human malignant tumors worldwide. The World Health Report 2004 ranked esophageal cancer as the highest cause of cancer mortality in China. Among the 446,000 cases of death caused by esophageal cancer worldwide, more than half occurred in China, i.e. 228 thousand (WHO, 2004) . A national sample survey of malignant tumor mortality conducted between 2003 and 2006 showed the esophageal cancer mortality rate ranked fourth in China, following gastric, liver, and lung cancers. In recent years, the rapid economic growth in China has amplified the increasingly polluted waters in several main rivers and lakes, resulting in substantial threats to the health of residents living adjacent to these ecosystems (Van Grinsven et al., 2006; Kenneth et al., 1987; Wang and Liu, 2006; Chang, 2006; Hu et al., 2009; Song et al., 2008; Zhen et al., 2008) . To date, it has not been definitively established if pollution is a major risk factor for esophageal cancer on a national scale. Consequently, specific measures at the national level to counter the effects of water pollution, and reduce/prevent esophageal cancer rates have not been implemented. Therefore, medical geography research (Yang et al., 2010) , which identifies the degree of health effects and associated geographic patterns, will serve to examine water pollution in major rivers and lakes of China, the relationship with increased rates of esophageal cancer, and establish any significant correlation between increased pollution and disease. Disease prevention is of primary importance to elucidate pathogenesis, and formulate strategies and countermeasures to prevent and treat esophageal cancer in China. Research on cancer risk factors remains the foundation and focus of cancer prevention and treatment investigations (Zhang and Wang, 2009; James, 1999; Brownstein et al., 2002; Gatton et al., 2005; David et al., 2012) . Presently, risk factor research is focused on poor eating habits (Lei et al., 2006) , smoking and other unhealthy lifestyles , stress and other mental health and illness factors (Pan, 2006) , the absence of trace elements in diets (Yang, 2009; Huang et al., 2002) , upper gastrointestinal disease history (Yang et al., 2008) , genetic predisposition for various cancers (Luan et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2008) , economic conditions (Tong et al., 2007) , and food contamination and carcinogens in the local environment, including water (Farhad et al., 2009; Nobuaki et al. 1996; . Most studies on the relationship between esophageal cancer and water pollution reflect the individual case specifics in a distinct geographic region (Han et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2010; Shen et al., 2002; Wei et al., 1999; Soliman et al., 2006) . Some studies have conducted spatial-temporal analyses of esophageal cancer (Jacob et al., 2008; Nuria et al., 2007; Mohammadreza et al., 2011) , particularly the relationship between high localized incidence of esophageal cancer and environmental degradation of major drainage systems at the national scale. Previous research on environment and malignant tumor-related issues primarily adopted traditional approaches, including epidemiological investigations (Baudouin et al., 2002) , statistical analyses of risk factors in specific medical populations (James, 2004; Manami et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2006) , and laboratory testing (Peng et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008) , among other methods. Two major differences have been identified between these two approaches. One method emphasizes statistical parameters to explain a relationship (Liao et al., 2012; Kulldorff, 2005) between risk factors and malignant cancers. This methodology serves an important role in determining the mechanisms that influence cancer and the spatial threshold range of cancer and its risk factors (Liu et al., 2003; . Unfortunately, policy dictates that some studies must apply administrative divisions as research units, which prevent the effects of rivers, lakes, and other natural topographical units as risk factors in cancer research (Jiang et al., 2009; Li and Wang, 2005) . In recent years, a combination of traditional statistical methods and spatial analyses has facilitated enhanced understanding of the relationship between disease and the environment (Kate et al., 2008; Rogers and Randolph, 2003; Melissa et al., 2011; Hubbard et al., 2002; . The present study served to establish spatial associations between water degradation and pollution, and esophageal cancer mortality rates on a national scale in China by combining medical statistics with spatial analyses. The spatial threshold included water polluted major rivers and lakes, and the surrounding waterways to assess the impacts on human esophageal cancer mortality rates.@story_separate@Esophageal cancer mortality data were obtained from the China Ministry of Health. The National Sample Survey Dataset from 2003-2006 indicated 213 counties (municipalities and districts), including 116 urban sampling sites, and 97 rural sampling sites were selected in the study. Figure 1 provides the sample spatial distribution, including urban and rural sample esophageal mortality rates distributed throughout China, and the water quality grade in regional water sources. The Haihe and Huaihe river drainage basins exhibited high esophageal cancer mortality rates. Many regions showed high esophageal cancer mortality, including Cixian, Huixian, Junxian, and Yancheng counties, and Linzhou, Huaian, Taixing, Yangzhong, and Feicheng cities. Data indicated populations distributed adjacent to various river and lake drainage basins in southwest China had lower average esophageal cancer mortality. The China Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) provided water quality data. The earliest published national water quality data was in 2007, which is one year later than the national esophageal cancer investigation period 2003-2006. Consequently, we recognized limitations existed in examining a relationship between the two datasets. MEP and the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) delimited five water quality grade levels in China on a scale from I to V; where grades I-III indicate water safe for human consumption following treatment, grades IV-V are safe for industrial and irrigation use, and grade V+ refers to water that is unsafe for any purpose, and in some cases, the water may be unsafe to touch. The primary water pollution indicators in rivers and lakes are total nitrogen and phosphorus. The general water quality conditions in rivers and lakes in China are presented in Figure 1 . Seven major river systems are moderately polluted in China. Water quality data sampled from 407 sections that pertained to a network of 197 rivers, and found 49.9% and 51.1% were respectively classified in grades I to III and grades IV and V+. The Yangtze River is generally considered to maintain good water quality, however the Songhua River shows slight pollution, Yellow and Huaihe rivers are moderately polluted, and Liaohe and Haihe rivers suffer from heavy pollution. The 28 key state-controlled lakes and reservoirs exhibited 7.1% at Grade II; 21.4% at Grade III; 14.3% at Grade IV, including Jingpo, Dongting, Poyang and Xingkai lakes; and 57.2% at Grade V, including Chaohu, Nansi, Taihu, Dianchi, Baiyangdian, Dalai, Hongze, West, East, Xuanwu, and Daming lakes, and Laoshan Mountain, Dahuofang, and Yuqiao reservoirs. We established the following basic hypotheses to examine the effects of water pollution on esophageal cancer mortality at the 116 urban, and 97 rural sampling sites described in section 2.1. We assumed people used untreated river and/or lake water, or untreated groundwater as the primary source of drinking water. Due to distance cost, the number of people fetching water from a river reach is inversely proportional to the distance from the reach, i.e. the closer a population is to a river, the greater the probability water will be fetched from that water source. Alternatively, as the distance from a river and population increases, a concomitant decrease occurs in the probability a population will fetch water from that river. People will choose alternative sources of water if rivers and lakes are not close geographically. Furthermore, the impacts of infiltration resistance result in the contamination of groundwater from adjacent polluted rivers and lakes, which is also inversely proportional to the distance from rivers and lakes. Beyond a certain distance, water contamination exhibits no effect on groundwater quality. Therefore, it is necessary to determine a distance threshold. If lake and river pollution do in fact affect esophageal cancer mortality rates within this threshold among people fetching drinking water from river or groundwater, then we propose the following hypotheses: (1) Water pollution has increased the effects on esophageal cancer mortality rates in populations living adjacent to polluted river or lake sources; while populations residing further away from polluted water sources are at less risk of increased mortality rates due to eso-esophageal cancer. (2) Mortality rates due to esophageal cancer are higher among people that ingest and have exposure to highly polluted river and/or lake water; and mortality rates due to esophageal cancer are lower among people that ingest and have exposure to cleaner river and/or lake water. We can test the above hypotheses by spatially modeling the sampling site environmental differences and esophageal cancer mortality rates among sites, i.e. levels of MEP/SEPA classified water pollution data, and mortality rates derived from the Ministry of Health surveys. Based on the distance from river and lake water infiltrating into the groundwater, we also needed to investigate differences between mortality rates from sampling sites at various distances from rivers and lakes, and differences among sampling sites with a range of water pollution grades (I-V+). We applied ArcGIS 10 and spatial analyses (Wang et al., 2000; Leung and Kwong, 1993) , designed two different grouping models: 2.4.1 Grouping according to the buffer distance from rivers and lakes The practical distance for fetching water from various river and lake channels was 20 km, which was therefore set as a distance threshold. A total of 10 buffer zones were established for each river and lake, with each buffer zone arranged at a 2 km interval. Grouping based on esophageal cancer mortality and buffer distance from rivers and lakes was expressed as: where p represents the esophageal cancer mortality survey sampling site; and d p is the grouping according to the buffer distance from the sampling site to the river or lake. Subsequently, the sampling sites for the esophageal cancer mortality survey were assigned to 10 buffer zones with different distances from the rivers and lakes. Grouping according to the water quality grade SEPA water quality grades I through V were used as a reference. Near function was applied in the spatial analysis approach to assign the esophageal cancer mortality survey sampling site to the nearest water quality grade group, which was expressed as: where p represents the esophageal cancer mortality survey sampling site; and c p is the grouping according to the water quality grade. Subsequently, the esophageal cancer mortality survey sampling sites were assigned to one of the five water quality grades. Based on the different water quality grades and buffer distances, the Haihe River Basin was chosen as a model in this study. SS of the spatial analysis is presented in Figure 2 . There are 10 buffer zones marked by light green to deep green, at 2 km intervals. Due to serious water pollution, Grade I was not reported in the Haihe River Basin. Spatial computation was used to establish ten buffer zones for major rivers and lakes in China using the grouping method based on buffer distance from rivers and lakes at 2 km intervals for each buffer zone; 119 of 213 sampling sites satisfied the grouping conditions. The remaining 94 Sampling sites with distance to rivers and lakes exceeding 20 km were excluded from the analysis. Results indicated differences between urban and rural drinking water sources. Urban residents primarily used treated drinking water, while rural residents used untreated water as the primary source of drinking water. A 2006 survey showed people drinking untreated water represented 83.92% of the rural residents. Among the 119 sampling sites selected within the buffer zones, 72 urban sampling sites did not meet the requirement that individuals residing in the sampling sites used untreated river water or groundwater as their drinking water. Therefore, these 72 sampling sites were excluded. A total of 47 rural sampling sites met the requirements (Figure 3 ). These 47 sampling sites represented 22.07% of the total, however, this region represented 32.26% of the total esophageal cancer deaths nationwide. The mean esophageal cancer mortality rate for the 47 sampling sites was 12.72 in 1/10 million deaths, much higher than the national average (8.70 in 1/10 million deaths) calculated for all sampling sites. We spatially located esophageal cancer mortality sampling sites in 10 buffer zones (Figure 3) . The increased distance from rivers showed a mean decline in the esophageal cancer mortality rate (Figure 4) . The X coordinate represents the buffer distance from rivers and lakes, while Y represents the mean value of esophageal cancer mortality (in 1/10 million deaths) in each group. Results showed the increase in buffer distance resulted in a decreased trend in esophageal cancer mortality. A total of 80.4% of the esophageal cancer deaths among the 47 sampling sites were distributed in the five buffer zones close to rivers and lakes, while 19.6% were in the five buffer zones further away from rivers and lakes. We used Spearman's and Kendall τ rank correlation analyses to determine if a significant correlation in esophageal cancer mortality and distance from rivers and lakes could be detected throughout the sample sites. The results showed a significant negative correlation between esophageal cancer mortality and distance from rivers and lakes (Spearman's r = -0.721, P < 0.05; Kendall τ = -0.600, P < 0.05) ( Table 1 ). The results indicated that when infiltration resistance and distance costs were assumed, the first hypothesis was supported. The shorter the distance of sampling sites was from polluted rivers and lakes, the higher the number of esophageal cancer deaths, and vice versa. The nearest neighbor function was used to assign the 47 esophageal cancer mortality sampling sites to the nearest river or lake. We subsequently obtained five sets of river and lake water quality grades (I-V), and esophageal cancer mortality (in 1/10 million deaths) data groups. Results showed increased water pollution in rivers and lakes resulted in a rise in mean esophageal cancer mortality cases, from 9.47 at Grade I to 15.76 at Grade V ( Figure 5 ). Correlation coefficients between esophageal cancer mortality (Y-axis) and water quality class in rivers and lakes (X-axis) The X coordinate shows water quality grades of rivers and lakes, and the Y coordinate indicates mean esophageal cancer mortality values from sampling sites ( Figure 5 ). Deteriora-tion of river and lake water quality demonstrated an increasing esophageal cancer mortality rate trend. Grade V water quality areas, where water pollution was most serious, exhibited the highest esophageal cancer mortality, and represented 42.17% of the total esophageal cancer deaths among the 47 sampling sites. Results showed a significant positive correlation between esophageal cancer mortality and water quality grades (Spearman's r = 1.000, P < 0.001; Kendall τ = 1.000, P < 0.05) ( Table 2 ). Our results also supported our second hypothesis. River and lake water quality grades (I-V), i.e. indicative of pollution levels, suggested a significant effect on esophageal cancer mortality. The results of correlation analyses based on the two grouping approaches verified the hypotheses proposed in this paper. A significant positive correlation between esophageal cancer mortality and water quality grades, and a significant negative correlation between esophageal cancer mortality, and distance from rivers and lakes were supported. The correlation coefficient values indicated a higher correlation between esophageal cancer mortality and water quality grade, than with buffer distance from rivers and lakes. Therefore, the results of our study provided compelling evidence that river and lake water pollution plays a leading role in esophageal cancer mortality. Previous studies on the relationship between esophageal cancer and the environment reported that water pollution was associated with esophageal cancer mortality (Dissanayake and Rohana, 2009; Meri et al., 1997; Han et al., 1997; Zhao et al., 2005) , congruent with the results of the present study. However, these studies were scattered in different parts of the region with a high incidence of esophageal cancer. Moreover, the environmental contaminant indicators selected for the studies were varied, such as pollution index and nitrosamines (Sabo-Attwood et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2010) . Research methods also differed, including laboratory analyses that examined the influence of carcinogenic substances on the human body's internal environment, epidemiological investigations, and comparative analyses of case studies, among other approaches. We adopted SEPA/MEP standard water quality grades for China's major rivers and lakes, and used the distance from rivers and lakes as a unified and comparable indicator to explore the relationship between water pollution and esophageal cancer at a national scale. By combining statistical and spatial analyses, the influence of water pollution on esophageal cancer mortality was objectively analyzed. We defined two basic artificial research units as a result of this study. Rivers, lakes, water systems, drainage basins, and other natural geographic units were basic water pollution en-vironmental research units; whereas surveys and statistical sampling that estimated esophageal cancer mortality rates delimited an administrative region, which determined basic administrative research units. In most cases, these unit types did not correspond. Neighborhood function, buffer zone, and other spatial analyses were employed to achieve enhanced correspondence between geographic and administrative units, with increased mastery of the spatial relationship between water pollution and esophageal cancer mortality. Delimiting a geographic research unit served to overcome the limitations of only addressing risk factors for malignant tumors using a basic administrative research branch. We established buffer zones to determine the presence of a pollutant dispersion distance threshold between sampling sites, and rivers and lakes. We found esophageal cancer mortality at sampling sites in five buffer zones closer and five buffer zones further away from rivers and lakes showed a respective 80.4% and 19.6% of the total among the 47 sampling sites. A distance threshold clearly existed in the approximate 10 km. The primary purpose of this paper was the discussion of research methods, and not water quality indicators as a means to identify and prevent disease. We provided two general hypotheses to test the influence and distance threshold of groundwater pollution by rivers and lakes in this study. Quantization groundwater quality, river/lake pollution, and distance threshold still require in-depth discussions.@story_separate@The main results and conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) A significant negative correlation was detected between esophageal cancer mortality and buffer distance from rivers and lakes at the sampling sites within the 20 km distance threshold, which was an analytical result of grouping according to buffer distance. Spearman's and Kendall τ rank correlation coefficients were r = -0.721 and r = -0.600, respectively, P < 0.05. The esophageal cancer mortality at sampling sites in five buffer zones closer and five buffer zones further away from rivers and lakes showed a respective 80.4% and 19.6% of the total among the 47 sampling sites. Therefore, within the distance threshold (20 km), the resident distance from the polluted water sources indicated an effect on esophageal cancer mortality among residents. Due to infiltration resistance limitations, and distance costs for people fetching drinking water from water sources, the closer the water source (lower buffer distance), the higher esophageal cancer deaths; alternatively, the greater the distance to water sources (greater buffer distance), the lower the number of esophageal cancer deaths. (2) A significant positive correlation was determined between esophageal cancer mortality and water quality grades at the 47 sampling sites that satisfied the study criteria. Spearman's and Kendall τ rank correlation coefficients both exhibited r = 1.000 with respective P < 0.001 and P < 0.0.05. In the areas with water quality grades I to V, esophageal cancer mortality in Grade V water sampling sites alone was responsible for 42.17% of the total esophageal cancer deaths. Results showed areas with water pollution Grade V were also areas with the highest esophageal cancer mortality. Therefore, our study clearly indicated water pollution levels affected esophageal cancer mortality. (3) Correlation coefficient value comparisons demonstrated that esophageal cancer mor-tality rates exhibited higher correlations with water quality grades than with distance from rivers and lakes. The effect of water quality grades on esophageal cancer mortality was greater than distance from rivers and lakes. However, water quality grades, i.e. water pollution and river/lake distance were two leading factors in affecting esophageal cancer mortality. We identified significant correlations affecting esophageal cancer mortality in China: (i) esophageal cancer mortality and buffer distance from rivers and lakes; and (ii) esophageal cancer mortality and water quality grade values. The results clearly indicated that water pollution is a risk factor for esophageal cancer mortality in China. Environmental management must review water pollution, and integrate these health risk data into management plans to improve and sustain environmental and human health. Water quality must be elevated to acceptable levels in contaminated areas, and subsequently maintained at suitable standards to ensure the health of residents living in these areas will not be threatened in the future.","Esophageal cancer exhibits one of the highest incidence and mortality rates in China. Malignant tumors caused by esophageal cancer, and the relationship to environmental factors has been the focus of many public health studies. This study applied spatial analysis to ascertain the relationship between water pollution and esophageal cancer mortality rates nationwide. We employed two datasets, including a national investigation of esophageal cancer rates and distribution, and national water quality grades in China’s primary rivers and lakes. Esophageal cancer data were grouped based on different water quality grades, which included a scaled buffer distance from rivers and lakes. Non-parametric correlation analyses were performed to examine the presence or absence of the following correlations: (i) esophageal cancer mortality and buffer distance from rivers and lakes; and (ii) esophageal cancer mortality and water quality grade values. The present study revealed a significant positive correlation between widespread water pollution and esophageal cancer mortality nationwide; and a significant negative correlation between esophageal cancer mortality, and buffer distance from rivers and lakes."
"The lungs constitute the largest tissue interface between the human body and its environment. Exposed to an average of seven liters of inhaled air per minute, lungs are in direct contact with countless noxious particles, viral or bacterial pathogens, hazardous chemicals or toxic gases. As formulated by Green et al., ""Each day a surface as large as a tennis court is exposed to a volume of air and contaminants that would fill a swimming pool"" [1] . Not surprisingly the lungs are susceptible to numerous deadly acute and chronic conditions that constitute an immense global health burden. Indeed, respiratory diseases are directly responsible for one in six deaths worldwide [2] , and chronic respiratory conditions affect more than one billion people worldwide [3] . In Europe alone, the total cost of respiratory disease amounts to more than €380 billion annually [4] . Among all respiratory diseases, five account for the majority of morbidity and mortality worldwide: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, acute respiratory infections, tuberculosis, and lung cancer [5] . Recent reports suggest that onset or aggravation of respiratory disease caused by in-and outdoor air pollution, is responsible for 6.5 million deaths annually, a number likely to increase even further in the future [6] . It is therefore imperative to develop new therapeutic strategies for lung diseases, but this requires new tools to better study respiratory diseases and understand the underlying mechanisms. Studying lung disease pathogenesis and drug efficacy, as well as inhalation toxicology, necessitate physiologically relevant models of human lung tissue. While animals, especially rodents, have provided seminal insight into lung physiology and pathophysiology, they are limited in recapitulating the development, structure, disease symptoms, and responses of the human respiratory system, providing a strong rationale for developing and investigating human in vitro lung models for disease modeling, drug discovery, and drug testing [7, 8] . For instance, the timing of lung developmental events differs markedly between mice and humans. The prenatal saccular stage, in which alveolar sacs with distinguishable alveolar cell types form and surfactant secretion begins, takes place relatively earlier, and postnatal differentiation of immature saccules continues for a relatively longer time in humans compared to mice. This different pace of lung development results in a greater degree of branching and complexity of human distal lung structures including respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and associated alveoli [9] . Cellular composition also differs between mouse and human lung. For example, in the mouse airways, mucus-producing goblet cells are rare and secretory club cells (formerly known as Clara cells) are abundant, whereas the opposite applies to human airways [10] . Further, many gene mutations induce different, if any, respiratory symptoms in mice compared to humans [11] . While rodents remain the main animal model for pre-clinical studies, other non-rodent species such as guinea pigs, dogs, sheep, pigs and non-human primates which more closely mimic human lung physiology, are also used in preclinical studies. However, ethical and financial issues as well as non-availability of species-specific reagents often preclude their use for routine experimentation. Taken together, these limitations demonstrate that animals are imperfect models for a range of human lung diseases and their drug treatment, necessitating the need for human-specific preclinical models of the lung. Standard 2D culture of cancer or immortalized cell lines still represents the most common alternative to animal models for the study of tissue pathophysiology and response to pharmacological agents. The great advantage of such cell lines, the ease of use for highthroughput experiments, is clouded by their limited physiological relevance and clinical predictivity. In the past 10 years, advances in tissue engineering and soft lithography techniques have converged to give rise to Organs-on-Chips, miniaturized microengineered cell culture systems that recreate key functional and microenvironmental features of human organs in vitro [12] . Importantly, the idea is not to rebuild an entire human lung with its intricate architecture as so far this remains technically not feasible and would also greatly complicate the experimental manipulation, analysis, and interpretation of the engineered system. Rather, the promise and great benefit of Organs-on-Chips lies in their ability to recreate well-defined functional units of the lung, such as the alveolar epithelium-blood capillary interface, or the mucociliary barrier of the airways. Each specific Lung-on-Chip model can then be used to isolate, amplify, and systematically combine specific cellular and acellular components of the tissue and dissect their interaction as well as individual roles in health and disease processes. Concurrent with the advances in Organs-on-Chips technology, the field of developmental biology has made tremendous progress towards efficient culture and differentiation of stem cell-derived human lung tissue in the form of static 2D cultures or 3D organoids [7, 13] . While stem cell technology enables precise modeling of virtually any human tissue, and long-term cultures of patient-derived cells, Organs-on-Chips provide the cell microenvironment, biomechanical forces, vascular perfusion and circulation of immune cells, tissue relevant cyto-architecture, and sampling capabilities that organoids lack. It is therefore possible that combining both technologies will help to study human lung development and pathophysiology, responses to inhaled toxicants, evaluate drugs pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics (PK/PD), and discover new diagnostics and therapeutics. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive survey of existing state-of-the-art Organs-on-Chip systems that model human lung tissue and envision how this innovative technology can converge with the field of lung stem cells to establish highly relevant models of lung development, respiratory diseases and drug PK/PD.@story_separate@The difficulty of in vitro tissue modeling lies in the challenge to identify and then faithfully recapitulate the essential structural and functional elements of human tissue that govern healthy and pathological organ responses. Especially in the case of complex organs such as the human lungs, the challenge is increased by the incomplete understanding of the organ's morphology and physiology as exemplified by the unclear role that several of the 40 different resident cells play in lung homeostasis [14] . While the lungs exert an essential but seemingly simple vital function by providing a constant supply of oxygen and removal of CO 2 through gas exchange between the inhaled air and circulating blood, lung morphology is complex and consists of distinct units with specific physiological roles. These units include regional sections that can be defined by their respective cellular composition and function, such as the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles or small airways, alveoli or air sacs, stromal connective tissue, blood vessels, and hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue, and functional units such as the epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit (EMTU) [15] or the alveolar-capillary interface (Fig. 1) . Together, these units build the organ's architecture and enable the process of gas exchange. Specifically, inhaled air enters the respiratory tract through the nasal and oral passages and flows through the conducting airways until it reaches the distal airways and alveoli. The conducting airways are composed of the trachea that divides into bronchi and bronchioles. The bronchioles lead to the alveoli that constitute most of the lung surface area and enable gas exchange with the circulating blood. The conducting airways are lined with highly specialized cells including ciliated cells, mucus producing cells called goblet cells, and club cells, while underlying basal cells act as progenitors. The relative proportion of these cells depends on their location in the respiratory tract [14, 16] . For instance, while club cells are almost nonexistent in the upper airways lining, they constitute a large part of the terminal and respiratory bronchioles cell population [16] . Similarly, goblet cells account for 10 to 15% of epithelial cells in large airways but are almost absent from terminal and respiratory bronchioles [16] . This characteristic cell distribution can be altered during chronic diseases. For example, increased goblet cells number in the airway lining has been observed in patients with obstructive respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD [17, 18] . The distal, respiratory part of the lungs contains an average of 450 million pulmonary alveoli constituted by thin, flat, non-dividing alveolar type 1 (ATI) cells that enable gas exchange, and small, cuboidal alveolar type 2 (ATII) cells that secrete pulmonary surfactant and can divide and differentiate to replace damaged alveolar cells [19] . In addition, the human lungs are home to numerous resident and circulating immune cells including macrophages, innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils that contribute to the protection from pathogens and noxious particles continuously entering the lungs Fig. 1 . Cell population diversity and location in human lungs and corresponding on-chip models. For each on-chip model, cell origin is indicated (L = human cell line; P = human-derived primary cells). [20] . Further, the submucosa surrounding the conducting and respiratory airway epithelium includes airway smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and neural cells that play major roles in health and disease [21, 22] . Sub-mucosal cells also play critical roles in many respiratory diseases. For instance, secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and hyper-responsiveness to external stimuli by airway smooth muscle cells contribute to tissue inflammation and lead to bronchoconstriction and airflow obstruction in asthma [23] . Similarly, uncontrolled activation of lung fibroblasts plays a central role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis [24] . The submucosa also harbors a network of blood and lymphatic vessels comprised of endothelial cells and pericytes that help recruit circulating immune cells during the inflammatory response. Hence, the human lung is a complex tissue comprised of numerous populations of cells that interact and depend on each other to grow and function properly [25] . The high diversity in cell types, numbers, function and tissue morphology among the different lung regions and disease states is an essential parameter to consider when designing an in vitro model of the human lungs and precludes a one-model-fits-all approach. Instead, the appropriate model will depend on the experimental questions one wishes to answer, with the goal of recapitulating the key morphological and functional features of the organ unit. Specifically, this might require the spatiotemporal interaction of different cell types involved in the function or pathophysiology of interest. An effective strategy is to initially create a simple, well characterized base model and increase complexity by adding cellular components one by one, in order to reveal their individual contributions. Given the technical and ethical difficulties of using real human organs to carry out research, scientists have largely relied on simpler and smaller surrogate models to gain insight into human physiology and pathophysiology. Modeling human diseases in general, and lung diseases in particular, largely depends on immortalized cell lines or primary cells combining one or more cell types, cultured in a static, 2D environment, and on animal models (Fig. 2) . However, while cell monolayers are easy and cheap to use and amenable to high throughput studies, they cannot replicate the functions of many tissue-specific, differentiated cell types or faithfully predict in vivo tissue functions and drug effects observed in the native 3-dimensional human organ [26] . On the other hand, although animal models provide access to 3D native tissues and are indeed used for modeling human diseases and assessing efficacy of therapeutics in a number of tissues and organs, they are often poor predictors of clinical success due to species-species differences in mechanisms of action or toxicities of drugs [27] . For instance, failure was reported for 18 out of 23 Phase II/III clinical trials testing 17 distinct therapeutic anticancer vaccines [28] due to elevated levels of circulating immunosuppressive cytokines and various immunological checkpoints in humans that may not be present in rodents [29] . Lung specific studies equally suffer from these limitations and over-reliance on animals to model complex human respiratory diseases such as asthma have contributed to the lack of new efficacious treatment despite huge research efforts, as animal models have a long record of failing to predict clinical efficacy of novel therapies in human [30] . This is also true for several other respiratory diseases, including cystic fibrosis. The DeltaF508 mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the most common genetic cause of human cystic fibrosis; however, mice with the DeltaF508 mutation do not have any respiratory abnormalities [31] . Also, investigations of human respiratory infections are hindered by the lack of human pathogen-specific receptor in animals. For instance, a majority of rhinovirus types uses human intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) as an entry receptor but cannot bind the murine form, precluding infection of mouse airway cells [32] , although transgenic mouse models expressing human ICAM-1 have recently been developed [33] . Animal models are often also not permissive for replication of human viruses [34, 35] . The utility of animals to study human chronic diseases such as asthma and develop therapeutics is also controversial as most animal models do not naturally exhibit the asthma disease phenotypes observed in humans [36] . The limited clinical predictive value of traditional cell culture and animal models have motivated the development of more complex human in vitro 2D or 3D models that incorporate multiple types of differentiated cells or involve cell patterning in order to be more representative of the morphology and function of human organs. Three dimensional cell culture usually relies on bioinspired scaffolds made of extracellular matrix (ECM) or synthetic polymers as well as specific growth factors or co-cultured mesenchymal cells which induce cells to polarize and differentiate into cellular structures resembling in vivo tissue morphology and function. When grown in ECM hydrogels, cells can self-assemble into 3D cellular clusters known as spheroids or organoids that contain multiple cells types resembling the organ tissue architecture and recapitulating some specific organ function [37] . Lung organoids derived from human primary lung tissues, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are also referred to as tracheospheres, bronchospheres, and pneumospheres (or alveolospheres), and have been successfully employed to study lung development and pathophysiology [19, [38] [39] [40] . Nonetheless, they also have limitations [41] ; organoids lack the native organ microenvironment and appropriate cyto-architecture that is often essential in disease development, tissue growth and repair. Another drawback of 3D organoid cultures is that analysis or stimulation of enclosed cells, particularly to measure transmembrane transporter activity, evaluate the transport and metabolism of drugs across the cell layer, or to quantify the release of inflammatory mediators or newly formed virions, is often precluded by the difficulty of accessing and sampling luminal contents. Also, exposing the organoids to uniform drug concentrations may be hampered by the slow diffusion and interference with the ECM hydrogel, or the technical difficulty of micro-injection into the luminal space. In addition, organoids usually lack tissue-tissue interfaces, such as the interface between vascular endothelium and surrounding stroma and parenchymal cells, which are essential for the morphology and function of virtually all organs. Finally, exposing epithelia to airborne substances to mimic environmental exposures or inhaled drug delivery is not readily feasible in organoid cultures. While it is possible to break up organoids and thereby expose their apical side to airborne substances, the mechanical forces used in the process, e.g. rapid pipetting and sudden changes in the media composition, may cause cellular stress and therefore alter responses. 3D models of the human airway epithelium based on air liquid interface cultures of primary epithelial cells in transwells inserts have also been shown to closely mimic the gene expression signature of the human airway epithelium in vivo [42, 43] and to recapitulate several hallmarks of human airway epithelium in vivo, leading to seminal insights into numerous biological processes in lung development and pathophysiology [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . However, as for organoids, these models typically lack physiological fluid and solid mechanical cues, including shear flow and tensile and compressive stresses that cells experience in vivo. The absence of fluid flow also prevents perfusion of cultured cells with circulating blood and immune cells and limits modeling of inflammatory responses to infection or drugs. Though relatively novel and not yet as familiar to investigators, the emergent field of Organs-on-Chips promises to overcome the limitations of traditional in vitro model systems by offering microengineered features such as dynamic stresses and microscale flows. Thus, combining the best attributes of stem cell assays and Organs-on-Chips technologies might enable the design of a more powerful in vitro model of the human lung. Recent advances in microfabrication and tissue engineering have made it possible to create Organs-on-Chips -i.e., continuously perfused microchannels lined by living human cells. This design can reconstitute key functional and microenvironmental features of whole organs including tissue-tissue interfaces, mechanical forces, fluid flow, and biochemical gradients [50] [51] [52] . Organs-on-Chips have been shown to reproduce complex integrated organ-level responses to pathogens and inflammatory cytokines, as well as nanoparticles and pharmaceuticals; they can also effectively recapitulate disease states and complex pathophysiological responses. Mechanically active Organs-on-Chips populated with human cells therefore promise to provide more predictive models and provide lower-cost alternatives to animal and clinical studies for disease modeling, drug testing and safety applications [26] . As discussed in the following, Organs-on-Chips aim to recreate the complex, dynamic state in which living cells function within the native human organ, including interactions with the substrate (extracellular matrix), tissue-tissue interface, mechanical forces, immune cells and blood components, and biochemical microenvironment, which are critical in lung health and disease. The ECM is the non-cellular component of a tissue that provides the structural scaffolding and biochemical and biomechanical support to the surrounding cells. In the lung and other organs, the ECM gives the tissue its physical and mechanical properties, contributes to tissue development, morphology and function, and influences cell shape and cell-cell interactions [53] . In the lungs, the ECM influences fundamental processes including cell signaling pathways [54] , cell shape and function [55] , cytoskeletal organization and differentiation [56] , organogenesis [57] , and wound healing [58] . The ECM composition is not only specific to each organ but is also unique to the different regions of a tissue. In the lungs, which is a relatively soft tissue with an elastic modulus ranging between 1 and 5 kPa [59] , alveolar ECM is composed of a mix of collagen III, IV, V, laminin, fibronectin and elastin [60] whereas the ECM of the large airways includes collagens I, II (cartilage), V, laminin and fibronectin [61] . Further, extensive ECM remodeling has been implicated in many physiological and pathophysiological processes such as wound healing and pulmonary fibrosis [62] . Therefore, the ECM composition used in a model of the lungs must be carefully selected and will depend on the region and the disease state one seeks to model. While lung ECM scaffolding modulates cellular function, shapes tissue architecture and precisely compartmentalizes lung cell populations, cell behavior is also determined by the constant interaction between neighboring cellular compartments. Interactions can be mediated through direct cell-to-cell contact, for example, between airway epithelial cells and fibroblasts during fibrosis [63] and between alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells in health and disease [64] . In addition, cellular interactions can also leverage soluble factors, such as in epithelial-endothelial cross talk during influenza virus-induced cytokine storms [65] , endothelial influence on epithelial differentiation [66] , and mesenchymal cell influence on epithelial development [15] . Such cell-to-cell cross talk can modulate tissue growth, differentiation, and cell activation mediating the recruitment of immune cells during inflammation. Such multi cell type interactions can also be recapitulated in Organs-on-Chips; for instance, co-culture of differentiated human primary airway epithelial cells and endothelium in close proximity results in cross-communication between both tissues following treatment with a pro-inflammatory stimulus [52] . Similarly, stimulation of the epithelium with a pro-inflammatory agent results in activation of the underlying endothelium, as indicated by overexpression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-Selectin [52, 67] . Despite extensive studies, the magnitude and nature of the mechanical forces experienced by the lung epithelial cells during development, breathing movements, and disease states are still not well understood and remain the object of intense research [68] . It is admitted that during normal breathing movements, lungs undergo dynamic deformation estimated to cause 4% stretch distension of the basement membrane [69, 70] , while deep inspiration may induce a 12% stretch distension [71] . During bronchoconstriction in e.g. asthma patients, compressive forces act on parts of the airway wall [72] . These mechanical forces strongly influence lung cells, including effects on growth and repair, surfactant release, injury, inflammation [72] [73] [74] [75] , as well as tissue development from fetal to adult stage [73, 76] . Additional mechanical forces that influence cell function and development include shear stresses induced by the bidirectional air flow in the lumen of the conducting airways and the blood flow in the capillaries. Endothelial cells are able to sense and adapt to variation in the blood-flow and the vascular wall serves as an interface between the blood and tissue and can respond to hemodynamic cues. The physiological shear stresses acting on the vascular wall have been show to modulate gene expression, cell morphology, and cell metabolism [77] [78] [79] of endothelial cells. Organs-on-Chips offer the possibility to apply and control physiological biomechanical forces, including breathing movements [67, 80] and shear stresses resulting from air and blood flow [81, 82] that cells experience in vivo. The biochemical surroundings of cells are composed of elements that are secreted or transported through the tissue. These include growth factors, hormones, dissolved gases, and small molecules such as salts and nutrients. In the lungs, biochemical mediators are central to processes ranging from tissue development and homeostasis [83] , to inflammation and injury resolution [84] . Lung cells also play a significant role in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous hormones such as serotonin, leading to degradation as well as activation of important biologic properties [85] . Xenobiotic-metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes expressed in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium, club cells, type II alveolar cells, and alveolar macrophages in human lung activate environmental chemicals, modifying cell biochemical microenvironment and contributing to pathologies such as cancer and COPD [86] . Expression and activity of such enzymes is in part determined by epithelial differentiation, indicating the need for appropriate cellular differentiation in models [87] . Organs-on-Chips offer the possibility to accurately control the regional and temporal biochemical microenvironment of cells through controlled perfusion of growth medium and gases. Circulating and resident immune cells are key effectors of inflammation and play a central role in the pathogenesis and resolution of respiratory diseases. Together with airway epithelial cells, lung resident and circulating immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages initiate and orchestrate immune responses [88] . The ability to perfuse fluids through Organs-on-Chips not only allows dynamic supply of nutrients and gases, but also enables perfusion of immune cells under physiological conditions, such as shear stress experienced within microvessels [67, 89] . This unique feature enables visualization and real time monitoring of the interaction between freshly isolated, circulating immune cells with lung endothelial and epithelial cells [52, 67] . Whole human blood can also be perfused through Organs-on-Chips and, for example, thrombotic events have been modeled and utilized to assess drug delivery, toxicity, and efficacy [82, 90] . The field of Organs-on-Chips derives from ""miniaturized total chemical analysis systems"" or μTAS, microscale chemical platforms directly inspired from the development and miniaturization efforts of the electronic industry in the second half of the twentieth century [91, 92] (Fig. 3) . These μTAS, later regrouped under the name ""lab-on-a-chip"" systems, integrate fluidic microsystems into a single platform to perform several steps of a chemical assay [93, 94] . Originally, these systems did not contain any living components. Adding living cells was facilitated when new methods to fabricate microscale fluidic channels were established as an alternative to fused silica capillaries [95] . Specifically, Organs-on-Chips emerged from the convergence of cellular micro-patterning methods designed to control cell shape and function with early miniaturized systems for electrophoresis [96] [97] [98] [99] . Micro-engineered cellular systems were initially called ""cells on chip"" to illustrate the merger of cell biology with microfabrication methods adapted from the computer microchip industry [50, 51, 100] . The more recent denomination ""Organs-on-Chips"" implies the modeling of complex physiological organ-level function in microfabricated biochips. However, in place of silicon Organs-on-Chips are typically made from hydrogels [101] or a silicone elastomer called poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) which has played a central role in Organson-Chips sudden popularity [95, 102] . PDMS offers numerous mechanical and chemical advantages over traditional micro-engineering materials such as glass and silicon [103] . First, PDMS is relatively inexpensive compared to silicon, allowing cheap prototyping. PDMS stiffness can also be easily modified by controlling the degree of crosslinking between the polymer chains, enabling the design of soft and stretchable surfaces similar to the mechanical environment of cells. Moreover, since PDMS forms a tight seal with glass and can be reversibly or irreversibly bound to plastic polymers, hybrid devices containing rigid parts can be constructed. Importantly, PDMS is non-toxic and easy to work with, and rapid prototyping methods involving soft lithography and replica molding permit the creation of inexpensive devices with complex flow channel designs [102, 104] . Finally, PDMS is gas permeable, biocompatible and optically clear which makes it particularly well suited for growing living cells in enclosed fluidic microchannels and monitoring their behavior using various types of light microscopy. Faced with the promises and challenges of tissue engineering, notably the need for cellular scaffolds and blood perfusion of engineered in vitro tissue, researchers in the mid-nineties and early 2000s started to adapt microfabrication approaches to culture human cells and engineer human tissues [98] [99] [100] 105, 106] . Early attempts at cellular micro-patterning used PDMS microchannels sealed against a tissueculture dish to support the alignment, perfusion, and growth of 3T3-J2 fibroblasts [97] . Later, microfluidic designs were modeled to incorporate blood capillary-like channels to support the culture of human endothelial cells [107, 108] , quickly followed by other cell types, including liver [109] [110] [111] [112] , muscles [113] , bones [114] , brain [115] , gut [116] , and kidney [117, 118] . In parallel, inter-connected culture chambers containing cells derived from different organs and later called ""body-on-chip"" systems were developed and applied for pharmacological studies [119, 120] . Hence, Organs-on-Chips were originally developed to solve perfusion and scaffolding challenges encountered in the field of tissue engineering. However, their potential to recapitulate complex human organ-level functions became rapidly evident and led to an array of advanced models of human lung tissue, such as the ""lung-on-a-chip"", ""alveolus-on-a-chip"" and ""small airway-on-a-chip"" [50, 52, 80, 82, [121] [122] [123] . Applications include the study of lung cells growth and injury [122, 123] , modeling of alveolar tissue-tissue interaction and inflammatory processes [50] , responses of the alveolar epithelium to drugs, mechanical stresses [81, 121] , and pulmonary thrombotic events [82] , as well as lung cancer [124] . Most recently, a functional dynamic model of human airways comprising well-differentiated airway epithelial cells at air-liquid interface has been developed. Importantly, the airway epithelium is supported by a porous membrane and interacts with a continuously perfused pulmonary microvascular endothelium underneath that experiences physiological shear stress allowing circulation of immune cells. This model has been leveraged to model human obstructive respiratory diseases and human viral infection, and test novel therapeutics [52, 125] . Several attempts have been made to develop and characterize a functional alveolus unit on-Chip [67, 80, 82, [121] [122] [123] [124] . Most of these attempts sought to recapitulate the alveolar-capillary interface by recreating the boundary between the lung's air sacs and its capillaries within a microengineered system. The majority of the systems reviewed here rely on a similar chip design: a microengineered chamber divided longitudinally into two parallel channels by a flexible, ECM-coated porous membrane that recreates the alveolar interstitium. Such designs support the growth of human alveolar cell lines [67, 81, 121] or primary [80, 82, 122, 124] epithelial cells at an air-liquid interface, while human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) or umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) line the opposite side of the same membrane and are exposed to the laminar flow of culture medium. The use of elastic materials for membrane and chip housing enables linear or 3D cyclic stretch that recreates motions of a breathing lung and influences cell behavior [73] [74] [75] . These systems have been applied to replicate diseases of the lungs, investigate mechanical stress and cell damage, explore immune cells recruitment and extravasation, and test drug efficacy and toxicity. The first alveolus-on-a-chip, originally called ""Lung-on-a-chip"" has been used to recapitulate complex physiological mechanisms such as diapedesis of circulating human primary neutrophils following stimulation of the alveolar epithelium with TNF-α or infection with a strain of E. coli [67] . In this disease model of bacterial infection of the lung, the endothelium situated underneath the alveolar epithelium becomes activated, as indicated by a rapid increased expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1, and promotes adhesion and extravasation of perfused neutrophils. As Organs-on-Chips are made of PDMS, a transparent polymer, the whole physiological process can be observed by real time, high resolution microscopy [50] . Similarly, the ""Lung-on-a-chip"" recapitulated silica nanoparticle-induced toxicity and uncovered the critical role of breathing motions in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the cellular uptake of nanoparticles and their transport across both cell layers into the vascular channel [50] . Another application of the original ""Lung-on-a-chip"" includes replication of human pulmonary edema through IL-2-induced lung toxicity [81] . IL-2 was shown to induce limited pulmonary vascular leakage into the air channel under static conditions whereas physiological breathing motions significantly increased vascular permeability, a response which could be attenuated pharmacologically by a TRPV4 inhibitor [81] . Another model of the lung alveolar epithelium on-chip has been applied to investigate the effects of mechanical strain and surface tension (propagation of the air-liquid interface) on cell death in A549 cells and murine type II alveolar epithelial cells [121] . Whereas the first Lung-on-Chip recapitulates a linear stretch, this alternative design contains a circular stretchable diaphragm whose downward deflection enables a 3dimensional stretch of its tissue lining. More recently, efforts have been made to increase the chip's physiological relevance by using human primary alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells instead of cell lines [80, 90, 124] . Stucki et al. designed another version of an alveolus-on-a-chip that also supports a 3D cyclic deformation of human primary alveolar epithelial cells [80] . This study found that, compared to static conditions, cyclic stretch affects barrier permeability and increases the metabolic activity of primary alveolar epithelial cells and the release of inflammatory markers. A complex model of intravascular thrombosis utilizing human primary alveolar epithelial and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells has been also developed to assess antithrombic therapeutics [82] . In this model, all sides of the vascular channel are coated with ECM and seeded with endothelial cells to prevent clotting of the perfused human whole blood. The study shows that treatment of the alveolar lumen of the epithelium-endothelium co-culture with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, triggered thrombotic events. Conversely, LPS stimulation of endothelial cells alone did not lead to blood clot formation, thus highlighting the importance of recapitulating the tissuetissue interface in a model of inflammation-mediated thrombosis. A model of lung cancer has also been developed in an alveolus-on-achip [124] . The model features an epithelium-endothelium interface with a small proportion of non-small cell lung cancer tumor cells in the alveolar space and was used to investigate the influence of the bio-mechanical microenvironment on tumor cell growth and migration. The study shows that cyclic stretch limits tumor cell invasion of the vascular compartment but also reduces the efficacy of the widely used class of cancer drugs, Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors, suggesting that local microenvironment cues may influence cancer cell growth and drug efficacy. Based on similar designs and microfabrication techniques used for the compartmentalized microfluidic airway system [122] and later on for the alveolus-on-chip [67] , several on-chip assays modeling various features of the human airways in health and disease have recently been developed [52, [126] [127] [128] . For instance, the new ""small airwayon-a-chip"" recapitulates the human bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium by supporting the full differentiation of a columnar, pseudostratified, mucociliary, bronchiolar epithelium composed of human primary airway epithelial cells isolated from normal or diseased cells from patients. As in the alveolus model, the epithelium is underlined by a functional human pulmonary microvascular endothelium experiencing continuous fluid flow [52] . Human airway cells cultured on-chip at air liquid interface for three weeks reconstitute an in vivo-like epithelium composed of ciliated cells with physiological cilia beating frequency as well as goblet cells secreting mucus into the lumen resulting in robust mucociliary clearance [52] . Interestingly, the proportions of ciliated, goblet and basal cells inside the mature smallairway-on-a-chip are strikingly similar to those found in human lungs, suggesting that the reconstituted tissue closely recapitulates the morphology and functions of the human airway epithelium (Table 1) . Perfusion of IL-13 through the vascular channel to recreate a microenvironment enriched with inflammatory Type 2 T helper (Th2) cells as observed in allergic asthma resulted in significant airway remodeling with goblet cells hyperplasia, increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduction of cilia beating frequency. This phenotype was suppressed following incubation with Tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that blocks cytokine signaling, which is a therapeutic prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis [52] . Using primary airway cells derived from COPD patients, the small-airway-on-a-chip was also leveraged to investigate exacerbations in COPD, and to measure human neutrophil recruitment to the activated endothelium following epithelial exposure to pro-inflammatory stimuli. In addition, because the small-airway-on-a-chip has a separate air channel, it is possible to circulate air-borne pollutants through the epithelial chamber and evaluate, for example, the response of epithelial cells to cigarette smoke [126] . Recent advances in airway modeling also include a new on-chip model of viral-induced asthma exacerbations [125] . Derived from the original small airway-on-a-chip, this new chip supports infection of fully differentiated human airway epithelial cells with a human rhinovirus (HRV) to high titers and enables immune cell diapedesis through a 3 μm pore membrane. Stimulation with IL-13 altered HRV-induced proinflammatory and interferon responses and increased neutrophil recruitment to the vascular walls. This response was pharmacologically inhibited by a CXCR2 antagonist. Alternative on-chip systems of the human airway epithelium include a triple channel chip design where an additional compartment containing fibroblasts is inserted between the epithelial and vascular channels [128, 131] . This configuration, however, so far does not support full differentiation of the human primary airway epithelial cells but remains promising for investigating cross communication between the three different cell populations and their respective influence on each other's growth and differentiation. In addition, including fibroblasts may be useful for studying diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Using a markedly different design approach, Nesmith et al. built a human airway musculature-on-a-chip consisting of ECM cantilevers actuated by primary human bronchial smooth muscle cells [127] . When stimulated with IL-13, increased cantilever curvature mimicked acetylcholine-induced hypercontractility observed in asthmatics, a response that could be reduced by a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. To date, every Lung-on-Chip systems relies on cancer or immortalized cell lines or primary cells to reconstitute lung tissue in vitro. While cell lines are cost efficient and enable high-throughput studies, they are progressively being replaced by primary cells isolated directly from human or animal tissue as the biological relevance of cancerous or otherwise immortalized cells is increasingly questioned [132] . Primary cells offer a number of advantages compared to cell lines including recapitulation of original tissue characteristics, the ability to differentiate to in vivo-like tissue, preservation of donor disease phenotypes, increased predictiveness of human responses to drugs, control of cell source, and increased donor diversity to reflect natural diversity of human population. Nonetheless, primary cells also have important drawbacks. First, primary cells usually have a limited lifespan, although methods to prolong culture have been developed [133, 134] . Primary cells are also difficult and costly to genetically modify as transfection efficiency can be very low, hindering effective and economical gene editing approaches. Finally, primary cell diversity can also be an obstacle to long term in vitro studies as cells from the same patients are hard to obtain. Human stem cells on the other hand can overcome some of these limitations of primary cells. For instance, because adult stem cells can be maintained indefinitely and are easy to transform, functional gene studies are particularly straightforward and inexpensive. Stem cells from a single patient can also be used to recreate virtually any cell type. This possibility is exceedingly valuable when the primary tissue is difficult to isolate, such as alveolar epithelial cells. Stem cells are also advantageous when autologous co-cultures systems (i.e. cells obtained from the same patient) are needed, for instance to insure compatibility when culturing epithelial and T cells together. It is therefore important to consider replacing primary cells in Organs-on-Chips with stem cells, either by differentiating 2D cultures of stem cells on-chip or by directly seeding 3D organoids inside the chips. Furthermore, combining Organs-on-chips with stem cell technology would potentially enable features that are currently missing in lung organoids and other stem cell-based systems, such as the recapitulation of dynamic physicochemical stem cells niches, access to luminal and vascular compartments, dynamic immune cell circulation, and controlled application of physiological mechanical cues ( Table 2) . Lung cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), particularly human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), hold great potential to build advanced in vitro models of human lung tissue and to further our understanding of lung physiology and disease. While numerous attempts have been made to generate airway and distal lung epithelial cells from human PSCs, only recently has this undertaking gained significant traction. Initial studies first reported efficient embryonic induction into mesodermal and ectodermal lineages; however, maturation into the third endodermal germ layer remained limited [135] . While recreation of posterior endoderm cell derivatives that give rise to organs such as the liver, intestine, and pancreas became possible in the early 2000s [136] [137] [138] , anterior foregut endoderm induction leading to lung tissues was not achievable until more recently. In 2011, a key study eventually elucidated a mechanism permitting stem cell differentiation into lung-specific endoderm precursor [139] , thus leading to an effective strategy for ESC and iPSC generation of lung epithelial cells. The basic protocol for generation of lung progenitor cells from ESCs and iPSCs in vitro is accomplished through directed differentiation, a process where in vivo tissue developmental stages are mimicked using controlled sequences of endogenous signaling factors [140] (Fig. 4) . Pluripotent stem cells are first directed into definitive endoderm through activin-A simulation, followed by anterior foregut endoderm (AFE) induction through dual inhibition of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor (TGF-β) signaling pathways [139] . Following AFE establishment, a ventral patterning step is needed mirroring the morphogenesis of the endoderm where the trachea and lung buds eventually emerge ventrally [141] . AFE ventralization is largely achieved through WNT, BMP, retinoic acid and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling [66, 139] yielding cells expressing transcription factor NKX2-1, the major marker for lung epithelial lineage (in addition to neural and thyroid tissue fate) [142] . This population of NKX2-1 + cells is considered the primordial lung epithelial progenitor able to differentiate into proximal airway or distal lung bud lineages, primarily defined by SOX2 and SOX9 expression, respectively [143] . Terminal differentiation is then directed by further pathway signaling modification and determined by specific sets of markers. Methods Table 1 Comparison of structure and function between a human airway epithelium in vivo and the human Airway-Chip. Values for human airways were reported in [16, 47, 129, 130] ; values from the Airway-Chip were reported in [52, 125] . Human airway Airway chip (SD) used for specification to proximal airway or distal alveolar progenitors are discussed in the next paragraphs. Over the past three years, notable progress has been made using NKX2-1 + lung progenitors to generate human alveolar epithelial cells, by leveraging strategies for maintaining human primary cells. The combination of glucocorticoids, growth factors, and cAMP effectors (dexamethasone, 8-br-cAMP, IBMX, and KGF/FGF7; collectively known as DCIK) [144, 145] has been shown to induce alveolar maturation through activation of PKA and CDP-choline pathways which upregulate lamellar body surfactant production in ATII cells [146] . Recognized markers of the distal alveolar epithelium include Surfactant Protein C (SFTPC), Surfactant Protein B (SFTPB) HTII-280, ABCA3, and LAMP3/DC-LAMP for ATII cells, while Podoplanin, Caveolin (CAV1), and Aquaporin 5 (AQP5) primarily define ATI cells. Stimulation of two dimensional cultures of differentiated PSCs growing in 2D with DCIK, FGF10 and WNT activators leads to expression of ATI and ATII markers, mature phenotypic characteristics of lamellar bodies, and functional surfactant uptake capability [147] . Similarly, PSCs spheroid cultures also induce cell maturation of the alveoli epithelium. Interestingly, 3D co-culture with human fetal lung fibroblasts and stimulation with DCIK yielded ATII specific markers and lamellar bodies formation, although functional maturity was not confirmed [148] . Functional lamellar bodies through BODIPY-labeled SFTPB uptake was later shown by first generating PSC lung bud organoids, followed by Matrigel culture with a WNT activator, FGF10, KGF, BMP4 and RA in place of DCIK. ATII markers were found to be abundant in this protocol while ATI markers were minimally expressed [40] . Advanced maturation of ATII cells characterized by the capacity of lamellar bodies to process surfactant proteins and produce dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) surfactant phospholipid was demonstrated by maturing NKX2-1 + cells in Matrigel with DCIK and temporally modulating WNT activity. Remarkably, mature forms of SFTPB and SFTPC could also be detected in the lamellar bodies, consistent with late-gestation primary fetal ATII cells [149] . Long-term expansion of alveolar epithelial cells, a challenge with distal lung cell cultures, was recently achieved using an organoid approach and a refined differentiation sequence after AFE induction [150] . This sequence differs from previous protocols by more closely mimicking the distal tip cell microenvironment through a preconditioning step of WNT activation, DAPT-mediated notch inhibition, and FGF10 plus KGF supplementation, resulting in SFTPC gene expression similar to levels found in the fetal lung. These cells were then matured using DCIK in organoids co-cultured with fibroblasts. Interestingly, co-cultures with fetal lung fibroblasts lines resulted in SFTPC expressing cells, though extremely variable (ranging from 2% to 51%), whereas incorporating a dermal fibroblast line showed no SFTPC induction. With passaging, the proportion of ATII cells in the culture increased to approximately 70%, and ATI-like cells were also present. Notably, induction of SFTPC expression was also achieved in fibroblast-free cultures using DCIK plus ROCK inhibition, WNT activation, and TGF-β inhibition, albeit at a lower efficiency of 23%. Protocols for proximal airway differentiation also advanced in the past few years. Differentiation of PSCs into airway epithelial cells was achieved in spheroids cultures using FGF10, KGF, WNT agonist and Notch inhibition [151] . More recently, modifying WNT signaling in the directed differentiation strategy efficiently induced proximal fate, potentially explaining why previous studies encountered difficulty in maintaining airway epithelial markers in culture. Suppressing WNT signaling after ventralizing AFE promoted proximal fate and led to epithelial cells expressing the classic markers SCGB1A1/CC10 for club cells, MUC5AC in goblet cells, and p63 and Keratin 5 for basal cells [152] .To promote cilia development of the airway, Notch inhibition in organoids or air-liquid interface in 2D cultures produced motile multiciliated cells characterized by acetylated alpha-tubulin (α-Tub) staining [152] [153] [154] . Another protocol used 2D air-liquid interface cultures with FGF18 stimulation to generate a mature and polarized epithelial layer, in which motile cilia and mucus could be observed at the apical surface [155] . It was shown that the scaffold and micro-environment of iPSC-derived lung progenitors is a major determinant for achieving a mature airway epithelial phenotype, as shown using human iPSC-derived lung organoids [156] provided with a bioartificial scaffold before transplantation to mouse epididymal fat pads [157] . Eight weeks following transplantation airway-like structures were observed only in organoids cultured and transplanted on the scaffold. For long-term expansion of iPSC-derived airway epithelial cells, it may be possible to incorporate findings from human primary cell cultures. Specifically, inhibition of TGF-β/BMP/SMAD signaling pathways was recently found to enable the long-term expansion of primary p63+ airway basal cells by inhibiting terminal differentiation and promoting self-renewal [134] , pathways that may also be utilized to improve proximal PSC lung cultures. Tracing the respiratory developmental path has provided major insights into lung differentiation, yet the majority of our knowledge about lung development stems from rodent studies due to limited availability of human samples. Recently, new studies have been conducted examining human lung development using various gestational week human fetal lungs [158] . The genetic transcriptome for mouse lung development was found to be remarkably similar to humans; further, differences between both may help identify targets and develop better strategies to advance human lung modeling. For instance, lung bud tip signaling is associated with BMP4 and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in the mouse, yet BMP2, BMP7, and Indian hedgehog (IHH) were found to be expressed in human tips. Additionally, human pseudoglandular tips were found to initially express both SOX2 and SOX9 rather than solely SOX9. Interestingly, these tip cells were used successfully as stem cells for forming organoids without mesenchymal cells under conventional FGF, WNT, BMP, and TGF-β signaling modifications [158] . Despite progress in recapitulating in vivo developmental pathways for lung differentiation, many signaling mechanisms still require further investigation. For instance, incorporating WNT signaling inhibition earlier in combination with TGF-β and BMP inhibition increased NKX2-1 expression, suggesting ventral patterning may begin before AFE [159] . Additionally, utilizing FGF2 and Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling for promoting AFE expressing NKX2-1 was successful, albeit with suboptimal efficiency [153] . Further, studies indicate that FGF signaling may be dispensable for lung specification, highlighting a need to explore the essential timing of FGF signaling [159, 160] . While current differentiation protocols are effective for both ESCs and iPSC sources, high induction efficiency remains one of the major challenges. The directed differentiation strategy results in heterogeneous populations of NKX2-1 + cells with efficiencies widely ranging from 20% to 87%, an outcome that led to the questioning of NKX2-1 as a lung origination marker, but was recently confirmed [161] . Additional tools for purifying lung progenitor cells could ultimately provide the necessary supply for in vitro applications. Recently, this was accomplished with the discovery of highly specific cell surface markers CD47 [161] and Carboxypeptidase M (CPM). These markers allowed for live tracking and sorting resulting in an impressive~90% purity of NKX2-1 + cells when differentiating into ventralized AFE [150] . Despite substantial progress in advancing the differentiation of lung stem cells, full maturation is still a key challenge as parameters defining fully differentiated epithelial cells are still evolving. For example, demonstrating SFTPC and SFTPB gene expression was initially sufficient to claim ATII cell differentiation. However, with the accelerated progress in lung PSC protocols, more strict metrics are now being considered to reach the ultimate goal of generating a supply of cells that recapitulates the same molecular, biochemical, phenotypical, and functional features found in the adult lung. Beers and Moodley, along with other leading experts and pioneers in the lung field, reviewed this concern and proposed a set of standards specific to alveolar cell generation in order to bridge lung biology with stem cell development [162] . In summary, for claiming terminal ATII cell maturation, cells need to demonstrate morphological similarity with in vivo tissue, a significantly mature surfactant system, characteristic lamellar body ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy, functional maintenance and repair of barrier function, self-renewal and regeneration, and transcriptomic analysis comparable to isolated ATII cells. This initiative to assist alveolar stem cell development calls for highly sophisticated techniques and protocols that Lung-on-Chip platforms may assist with, and requires researchers to fully characterize cell populations. These notions are applicable for all lung epithelial generation and paramount for developing relevant and standardized in vitro applications. Incorporation of stem cell-derived differentiated cultures into Lungon-Chips models offers new opportunities to study lung development and to develop patient-specific disease models. It also enables investigators to include different cell types (e.g. airway epithelial and endothelial cells) derived from the same donor within one model. By closely recreating the spatiotemporal dynamics and heterogeneity found in the lung, Lung-on-Chip models may also be useful for appropriate differentiation and maturation of stem cell-derived lung cells. Indeed, chemical signals, structural cues, ECM, and additional cell types have all been shown to enhance maturation of lung epithelial PSCs: implantation into injured mice, scaffolding using decellularized lung matrix, or multi-culturing with lung mesenchyme and fibroblasts have led to the development of lung epithelia of all fates [40, 148, 156, 157, 159, 161, 163, 164] . Furthermore, many lung PSC culture systems utilize a 3D system to create advanced lung organoids. Likewise, Lung-on-Chip models provide a dynamic microenvironment with increased cellular complexity, factors known to influence stem cell differentiation [165] . By delicately dissociating stem-cell derived organoids, it may be possible to seed matured lung cells onto the surface of the ECM-coated porous membrane forming a monolayer within the chip channels, thus supplying cells with a microenvironment characterized by physiological ECM, airliquid interface, stretch, and fluid shear. This will also allow introducing added complexity from a vascular channel for additional cell types such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts, which can be derived from the same iPSC donors resulting in a patient-specific model. Further, fluid flow and apical/basal distinctions in the Lung-on-Chip can be utilized to finely tune the timing and distribution of signaling factors, and explore spatiotemporal responses to stimuli. The multitude of parameters Organs-on-Chips technology provides for isolating dynamic and spatiotemporally heterogeneous aspects of in vivo physiology holds great potential for fully maturing lung PSCs and advancing in vitro lung models. Human microengineered systems, such as Organs-on-Chips, aim to provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of human tissues and enable the prediction of drug efficacy and safety in a physiologically relevant context. Once such benefits are clearly established, combining Organs-on-Chips with human stem cells in which all cell types come from the same donor would offer the opportunity to test compounds that correct patient specific phenotypes associated with defined genotypes or genes mutations, thus creating predictive platforms for the field of personalized medicine that offer complementary advantages to models based on animals and immortalized or primary cells [13] . While maturation potential and genetic stability of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remain superior [166] , tissue-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) present key advantages over ESCs, including renewable supply of patient-specific cells from individuals with acquired and genetic lung disease. The first 100 lung disease-specific iPSC lines were generated, including lines from individuals with cystic fibrosis and α 1 -antitrypsin deficiency, the two most common monogenic lung diseases [167] . Immediate research applications of these diseasespecific cell lines include probing the relative contribution of somatically acquired versus genetic risk factors, genetic engineering to induce or repair putative disease-causing mutations, the comparison of tissues derived from patients and their healthy relatives, and the study of both disease pathology in different genetic backgrounds and their response to drugs [168] . Direct consequences for clinical research are imminent: because stem cells are derived from a specific patient, analysis of their response to various stimuli or drugs should predict individual patient responses. For example, if a compound improves a specific function in a model using iPSC derived from a patient, the same result may be achieved in the patient. Conversely, if adverse drug effects are identified in human iPSC-derived tissues with a specific genetic background, it might predict drug failure in the clinical trial for this subset of patients. In monoculture, iPSCs are most suitable for investigating monogenetic diseases that have complete penetrance and well-defined cellular phenotypes caused by the mutation (cell-autonomous disease), such as cystic fibrosis cells with mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which impair chloride ion transport in cells that express CFTR. However, by integrating multiple cell types, immune cells, and a dynamic mechanochemical environment, Organson-Chip technology provides the ability to also study non-cellautonomous diseases such as asthma, in which environmental agents in concert with airway and immune cells generate a diversity of phenotypes. Lastly, Lung-on-Chip systems combined with iPSCs could facilitate research in rare pulmonary diseases for which there are no preclinical disease models [169] . In the following, we will discuss diseases that might benefit from stem cell-based Lung-on-Chip system. To provide a tangible example, specific research questions are outlined that could be studied in a Lung-on-Chip model of cystic fibrosis, but similar approaches are relevant to the other diseases discussed below. Mutations in the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis in humans, a debilitating disease characterized by persistent airway infections and permanent damage to the lung resulting from changes in chloride ion transport, mucus rheology, inflammation and bacterial adherence [170] . Over the past 20 years, there has been tremendous progress in alleviating the symptoms and even treating some of the underlying molecular causes of the disease, leading to a significance increase in life expectancy [171] . This advancement would have been impossible without the development of a host of preclinical assay in animal and traditional cell culture models [172] . However, there remains a lack of suitable model systems for certain mechanisms, including the predominant cause of pulmonary decline in CF patients, the infection with biofilm-forming phenotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that emerge in the CF lung [173] . Mice with deletion of the CFTR gene do not develop the spontaneous lung disease or chronic bacterial infections seen in humans [174] and, unlike humans, CFTR mutant mice appear to have alternate chloride ion channels compensating for dysfunctional transport by CFTR [175] . Recent development of pig and ferret models of CF alleviate some of these limitations and have been shown to recapitulate key aspects of CF in humans, including persistent bacterial infection of the lung [176] , however, these animal models do not replicate the highly specific association with P. aeruginosa seen in human patients, and are unlikely to support genotype-phenotype studies for most of the 2000 mutant CFTR alleles known to impair synthesis, trafficking, stability and/or ion gating function of CFTR [177, 178] . Human Organson-Chips, whose vascular and interstitial flow channels support the controlled addition of circulating or resident immune cells as well as bacteria, are a promising new avenue for studying the interactions between microbes, epithelium, and immune system [179, 180] . Among many applications, such a system could shed light on the development of the suspended 3D biofilm P. aeruginosa typically forms in affected patients, on the recruitment and response of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) to biofilms, the role of phagocytosis, neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) and neutrophil microvesicles on clearing, or failing to clear, P. aeruginosa, and the potential contribution of patientspecific (=CFTR-defective) PMNs to enabling chronic infection (Fig. 5A) [181] . As CF is characterized by heterogeneity in the therapeutic response rate, the interpretation of clinical trials can be problematic, suggesting that personalized treatment is required, based on appropriate endpoints and biomarkers [182] . Recently, a CFTR-dependent swelling-response of stem-cell derived gut organoids has been used as a bioassay to probe the disease phenotypes of different CFTR mutations and screen the mutation-specific efficacy of CFTR-restoring compounds [183] . Other, fluorescent signal-based assays enable phenotypic profiling by measuring CFTR-mediated conductance [184] . Stem-cell derived Lung-on-Chip models can augment these efforts by enabling the measurement of lung-specific functions, such as mucociliary transport, and clinically relevant endpoints, such as transepithelial potential difference and inflammation markers [185] . In addition to identifying new biomarkers most sensitive for classifying disease phenotypes and detecting drug responses, it could be probed, for example, how much functional CFTR needs to be present to normalize mucociliary clearance (Fig. 5B) . Another potential application of Lung-on-Chip models is to probe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of treatments for cystic fibrosis patients, such as inhaled antibiotics [186] , or CFTR modulators [187] (Fig. 5C) . CFTR modulators demonstrated that direct repair of the malfunctioning protein can partly restore normal lung function [188] . However, this treatment requires continuous pharmacological intervention. Hence, great hopes are placed into restorative therapies which would bring longer-lasting relief. Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology was used to restore normal functional CFTR intestinal stem cell organoids, demonstrating the powerful potential of these systems for testing human gene therapy [189] . Moreover, in 2017 a RNA-editing strategy for the most common CF mutation [190] successfully completed the Phase I trial (NCT02532764). Extending the limited functional readouts provided by organoids, Lung-on-Chip models can be used for gauging the improvement of tissue-wide functions, such as mucociliary clearance and transepithelial conductance. A range of pediatric lung diseases are due to mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins (SP-C, SP-B) or factors required for surfactant trafficking (ABCA3), causing surfactant deficiency. Mouse models generated by gene deletion tend to recapitulate only a subset of the clinical spectrum observed in human populations, likely because of different lung physiology, and no therapy has been developed thus far [191] . Stem-cell based in vitro models of human lung development [40] provide a new system for studying etiology and pathogenesis of these and other pediatric congenital lung diseases, and might lead to novel therapeutic approaches. Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and asthma are the most prevalent of all chronic respiratory diseases worldwide, and they rank among the top 20 conditions causing disability globally [192] . Both conditions engender respiratory distress and chronic inflammation of the lung and are thought to result from environmental exposure in genetically susceptible individuals [193, 194] . The symptoms can be further exacerbated by airborne particles, or viral and bacterial infection of the airways. Currently, there are many treatment options for managing severe asthma and COPD; however no treatments reduce disease progression [195, 196] . To advance this research, a plethora of model systems has been developed over multiple decades, ranging from very simple models using human cells (e.g. bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts) in mono-or co-culture, whole tissue explants (biopsies, muscle strips, bronchial rings) to in vivo studies in animals or in humans [197] . While these platforms cover substantial grounds, the addition of dynamically perfused, patient-specific microtissues could help dissect the contributions of environmental factors, genetic predispositions, and acquired susceptibility. In fact, animal models do not naturally develop asthma [36] , and even when they can be rendered sensitive to antigens, they fail to recapitulate all aspects of the human pathogenesis [198] [199] [200] . This is likely due to well-known differences in airways physiology, anatomy, and immunology between animals and humans [201] [202] [203] . For instance, secretory goblet cells are increased in size and number in COPD and asthmatic airways; this pathological hyperplasia is likely mediated by Notch signaling-directing differentiation of basal cells, the stem cells of the large airway, towards a secretory fate [204] . Mice, however, exhibit a much lower abundance of goblet cells than humans and therefore do not provide a good model for development and homeostasis of goblet cells in healthy and diseased human lungs. Traditional cell culture models using airway epithelial cells from asthmatics [205] or mimicking asthma by exposing normal epithelial cells to asthma-associated cytokines such as IL-13 [206] , have helped reveal the role of inflammation and the innate immune system in asthma [207] , however, the spatiotemporal dynamics of this process cannot easily be studied in either static culture nor in animal systems. Also, the origin of pathological inflammatory responses might be found in developmental events that are human-or even patient-specific, such as in utero fetal programming of gene expression involved in lung development [208] , or signaling from the microbiome during a critical postnatal time window thought to promote immune tolerance [209] . Human primary cell 3D models of the airways have demonstrated a new avenue towards addressing these and other questions in vitro [52, 210] . In the future, human stem-cell based Lung-on-Chip models that support the dynamic interaction with circulating immune cells, essential in asthma and COPD pathogenesis, could model inflammation and exacerbation, and lead to the evaluation of new therapies and treatment options. In pulmonary fibrosis, normal parenchymal tissue is gradually replaced by fibrotic tissue as a result of scarring, resulting in functional impairment. Pulmonary fibrosis may develop secondary to other diseases, such as autoimmune disorders or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) develops without a known cause, although the identification of disease-specific mutations in subsets of Example application for Lung-on-Chip for disease modeling. Small airway epithelium derived from stem cells of cystic fibrosis patients can be used to study universal cystic fibrosis disease mechanisms as well as the role of specific CFTR mutations within the context of the dynamic micro-environment at the blood-mucus-air interface. For example, the chip can be used to study A, the interaction between PMNs, biofilm-producing bacteria such as P. aeruginosa, and antibiotics treatment; B, the sensitivity and patient-specificity of new and established markers of lung function, including transepithelial potential difference, mucociliary clearance, and biomarkers of inflammation; and C, the efficacy of delivery and action of drugs for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients, such as CFTR modulators and antibodies. patients is clear evidence of a genetic predisposition [211] . IPF is a particular severe form of pulmonary fibrosis with a progressive decline in lung function, that causes the death of 80,000 US Americans and Europeans each year [212] . To date no therapy is available to reverse the disease process. In the recent years, two pharmaco-therapeutic agents, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been developed that can halt disease progression, however use of both drugs is associated with adverse effects [213] . While the precise disease mechanisms are still unknown, it is believed that myofibroblasts and fibrosis progenitor cells are responsible for the fibrotic architectural remodeling in the lung [63, 214] . Altered mucociliary properties could also contribute to the disease process by reducing clearance of noxious agents from the epithelium [215] . Several genetic polymorphisms and mutations predispose to IPF but how the fibrotic process is initiated and sustained remains unclear, partly because no good mouse model of the disease exist, leading to poor preclinical to clinical translation and extensive clinical trial failures [216] . Patient-specific in vitro models of the human alveolar epithelium are urgently needed to help elucidate the pathogenesis and role of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure in determining disease penetrance [214, 217] . Specifically, on-chip model comprising the different cell types of the alveolar epithelium, ideally from the same patient, and recapitulating the cross talk between alveolar epithelial cells and the surrounding fibroblasts could reveal unknown mechanisms of pathogenesis and lead to new therapeutic targets. In addition, the ability to test the influence of physiological mechanical stretch on alveolar cells in vitro is another attractive feature of Lung-on-Chip for modeling IPF. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality and causes more than 160,000 deaths per year in the United States [218] . Development of drug-resistant tumor cells and eventually fatal metastases is common despite aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, and long-term survival rates of lung cancer patients remain low [219] . Clearly, new treatment strategies are needed. Approaches that elicit anti-tumor immune responses such as antibody-based immune checkpoint receptor inhibitor therapy [220] or enhanced T-cell activation using gene editing [220] have raised great hopes; however, in many cases preclinical efficacy does not translate to human trials. For example, in some cases, immunologic response was not correlated with survival [221] . Perhaps more concerning, in recent phase II/III clinical trials, nearly 80% of all the studies failed [28] due to elevated levels of circulating immunosuppressive cytokines and various immunological checkpoints in humans that may not be present in animal models [29] . Indeed, there is a lack of human-relevant model systems where tumor biology in response to treatment and immune responses can be observed and quantified. Conventional subcutaneous implants of tumor tissue in mouse models do not mimic organ-specific differences in cancer growth or responses to drugs observed in the clinic [222] . Notably, human tumor xenografts implanted in mice at the corresponding organ site from which the tumors were derived are better at recapitulating physiological tumor growth and metastasis [223, 224] . These results indicate the importance of the organ-specific microenvironment in determining tumor biology and drug response; however, the contributions and spatiotemporal dynamics of the tumor-organ interactions have remained a ""black box"" because of the difficulty to visualize and probe tumor development in vivo. Conventional 2D in vitro cancer cultures, on the other hand, are amenable to real time imaging and investigation and have been the workhorse for studying molecular mechanisms of cancer, providing high throughput and direct comparison of experimental results with a wealth of literature and online data [225, 226] . However, there is evidence that the 3D architecture of real tumors might lead to different growth profiles and drug responses, and this has driven the development of 3D cancer cultures [227] . Extending these approaches to include the organ-specific microenvironment and heterogeneous cell populations, Organ-on-Chip models of human lung cancer provide an alternative approach by recapitulating the organ-specific 3D microenvironment, tissue-tissue interfaces, mechano-chemical cues, vascular perfusion and potential interactions with immune cells while also enabling continuous monitoring of tumor evolution and tumor-organ interactions [124] . Combining these approaches with stem-cell derived tumor tissues could improve translation of efficacy data from preclinical testing to the clinical and aid in the development of patient-specific therapies and treatment strategies overcoming tumor drug-resistance [228] . Respiratory infections of the lung from a viral or bacterial source are a major cause of human mortality worldwide. Third only to stroke and cardiovascular disease, lower respiratory infections constitute the most deadly communicable diseases, causing 3.2 million deaths in 2015 [2] . Tuberculosis and other bacterial diseases, together with influenza, as well as diseases caused by respiratory syncytial viruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses and coronaviruses, can cause life threatening conditions in healthy people. Even otherwise harmless infections can cause complications in patients with pre-existing lung diseases such as asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, or primary immunodeficiencies, and other conditions that alter immunologic mechanisms against microbial invasion [229] . Susceptibility to infection as well as onset, duration and severity of symptoms is controlled by dynamic and patient-specific host-microbe interactions which, in addition to the rise in antibiotic resistance, has contributed to the difficulty of developing effective treatments [230] [231] [232] . Lung homeostasis relies on a finely regulated balance between immune tolerance towards innocuous exogenous particles that continuously enter the lungs on the one hand, and defense mechanisms against infectious agents on the other hand. An imbalance in immune homeostasis of the lung can lead to exaggerated inflammatory responses such as allergies or a ""cytokine storm"" following viral infections which can lead to extensive tissue damage [233] . Respiratory infection pathogenesis is largely mediated by the interaction between the infected tissue and the host immune system, including lung resident and circulating immune cells. While most in vitro systems enable the study of isolated immune cells or epithelial cells in static conditions, human Lung-on-Chip models are dynamic fluidic systems that offer the unprecedented possibility to investigate interaction of lung endothelium and epithelium with the ability to flow immune cells in a dynamic fashion through lung capillaries. This unique feature can be leveraged to dissect individual roles of infiltrating immune cells in lung infection, to probe underlying disease mechanisms and to identify new therapeutic targets or facilitate vaccines development. Disease phenotypes are also modulated by more subtle interactions with the patient's resident immune cells. For example, pathogenesis of the tuberculosis causing bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis involves modification of core cell signaling pathways in immune cells and differences in patient-specific immune cell responses may explain why responses to infection are highly variable between patients [234, 235] . Hence, both the development of novel, host-directed therapies as well as understanding the mechanisms of disease onset and progression in tuberculosis would benefit from patient-specific in vitro models of the dynamic interactions between bacteria, lung cells, and the immune system [236] [237] [238] . Preclinical drug discovery and development process involves testing of drug's safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics (including drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion), as well as potential drug-drug interactions. Lung toxicity can also arise from inhalation of airborne substances or from prenatal exposure to blood borne chemicals. For the same reasons previously addressed, animal models, and particularly rodents, are limited in their ability to predict human responses, pointing to the opportunity of using stem-cell based Lung-on-Chips to advance the field. Drug candidates can induce specific adverse effects in the lungs, and the lungs may be affected by general cytotoxicity too. Several hundred medications, delivered by various routes, are known to cause druginduced adverse responses and respiratory complications [239] . Because the clinical, and histological symptoms are often non-specific, it can be difficult to diagnose lung-related adverse drug reactions, especially if the patient is taking multiple drugs, and hence pulmonary toxicity, estimated at approximately 3%, is likely under-diagnosed [240, 241] . Adverse effects can be idiosyncratic or due to a toxic reaction of the drug or one of its metabolites, since the lungs metabolize certain substances. In addition, secondary mechanisms such as immune system responses can cause further damage. For example, drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD) is a common complication which can cause acute respiratory distress leading to pulmonary fibrosis (characterized by proliferation of fibroblasts and extensive ECM deposition) [242, 243] . DILD is thought to be caused by direct, dose-dependent cytotoxicity to bronchial epithelial cells or the alveolar capillary endothelium, but also by a T-cell mediated immune response. While age, sex, existing lung disease, drug interactions, and drug dose are risk factors known to correlate with phenotype of DILD and other drug-induced respiratory diseases, a mechanistic understanding of factors influencing disease onset and progression is lacking. Human Lung-on-Chip models could help isolate and probe genetic predispositions of specific patient populations, elucidate interdependencies of risk factors, predict safety risks, and identify safe drug dosing regimens. In addition to probing drug safety, Lung-on-Chip models are also an attractive route towards improved in vitro models of inhalation toxicology to probe adverse effects of inhaled substances originating from environmental, occupational or other external sources [244] . In particular, exposure to cigarette smoke, airborne nanoparticles and ultrafine particulates has become an emerging health concern and is associated, among other adverse health effects, with inflammation, exacerbation of preexisting respiratory disease, lung cancer, and particle-induced lung fibrosis. Furthermore, inhalation of toxic gaseous airborne substances remains an important cause of lung injury through occupational exposure and, in some parts of the world, chemical warfare. For many toxic gases, mechanistic understanding and specific treatment options for acute and chronic injury are lacking, and human in vitro inhalation models of gas toxicity would address an unmet need [245] . The in vitro modeling of inhalation toxicity is particularly challenging because no standardized procedure for delivering airborne toxins and gases to an air-liquid interphase exist, let alone for incorporating the effects of breathing flow dynamics. Mode of delivery and flow dynamics, however, can greatly affect the relative exposure times and effective dose of toxicants and safety margins. Hence, the lack of standardized procedures also prevents standardized toxicity and dosing assays for inhaled agents [246] . Lung-on-Chip models present the opportunity to address this challenge and deliver airborne toxic particles and gases in a spatiotemporally controlled manner, enabling the study of toxicity by physiological inhalation and also, in the future, providing a means to standardize safety testing for inhaled substances [126] . Lastly, stem-cell based Lung-on-Chip models could also provide a system for studying the ability of chemicals to disrupt neonatal development of the lung. For example, it is known from animal studies that maternal exposure to nicotine, which passes through the placenta and can accumulate in amniotic fluid, causes alterations in postnatal lung function, such as overexpression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and collagens [247] [248] [249] . Studies in human embryonic stem cells have demonstrated the direct modulation of differentiation pathways in lung fibroblasts by nicotine, supporting the hypothesis that lung matrix deposition and hence connective tissue mechanics could be altered in postnatal lungs [250] . A Lung-on-Chip model recapitulating some steps of airway development could enable the real-time study of how complex multi-cell type interactions and deposition of ECM are affected by exposure to nicotine. For most chronic lung diseases the available treatments are aimed at providing symptomatic relief rather than curing underlying disease mechanisms [251] . Further, many new drugs being developed are based on disease targets that were identified many years ago with clinical trials plagued by high failure rates. A number of recent trials have shown promise only to fail at later stages [252] which underlies the need for better understanding of patient phenotypes and preclinical models with greater relevance, reproducibility and predictability. For carefully designed scenarios and disease stages, Lung-on-Chip models in particular could help identify preclinical endpoints that can be translated to the clinic, stratify diagnosis and therapeutic care based on molecular mechanisms, tailor treatments to patient subgroups, and design trial end-points that better predict drug efficacy. Indeed, in 2014, the Respiratory Expert Council (REC), a global team of research and clinical experts, presented recommendations for improving drug research and development for airway diseases [253] , three of which human Lungon-Chip models are poised to facilitate. First, to capture and understand the heterogeneity of airway disease pathophysiology and clinical presentation, airway diseases need to be redefined based on molecular mechanisms and systems-biology-based strategies, particularly network analysis, to characterize variability due to patient to patient differences and due to progression of the disease through various stages [254] . Categorizing the disease in this way could facilitate the design of patient-specific and stage-specific therapies and advance personalized respiratory medicine [255] . In the simplest application, systems-biology-based disease definitions can help address questions such as whether a new drug should be developed and tested in a broad disease category, such as COPD, or focus on specific disease phenotypes. In particular, even if patients exhibit similar symptoms on the clinical level, the molecular factors driving disease progression can be different, and vice versa [256] . Stem-cell based models can provide a platform to reveal genotype-phenotype relationships affecting drug responses in different patient populations. These pharmacogenomic insights could inform the design of clinical trials and determine the inclusion and exclusion criteria of patients to assure optimal drug targeting. Second, preclinical studies also need to take into account systemic manifestations of airway diseases, such as inflammation and immune system responses [257] and link them both to molecular and tissuelevel disease symptoms as well as clinical endpoints. Vascularized Lung-on-Chip models provide the dynamic environment allowing for controlled and experimentally accessible interaction between local lung tissue and systemic factors, such as immune system components, and even other organ tissues. Finally, new biomarkers of lung function are needed that can be translated between experimental models and the clinic. Of particular interest is the development of imaging markers and biomarkers that are sensitive to different stages of airway disease, demarcate early-stage lung disease, and group patients into distinct phenotype or endotype populations. Towards these goals, Lung-on-Chip models provide a system to identify dynamic morphological, soluble, genetic and 'omics' markers that could be integrated with clinical readouts from blood tests, biopsies, imaging, patient-reported outcomes and clinical endpoints, such as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ). Such multidimensional disease signatures would then support the design of endpoints that can be measured both in vitro and in the clinic which are directly related to disease progression and drug efficacy [258, 259] . Inhalation is an attractive route for drug delivery because its large surface area (70-140 m 2 in adults), good vascularization, and thin alveolar epithelium offer the potential for rapid absorption of pharmaceuticals either for local deposition or for systemic delivery [260] [261] [262] . There is also great interest in the development of inhaled drugs for localized treatment of lung diseases, including pneumonia [263] . However, accurate pulmonary drug delivery is not a trivial task because of the complex mechanical, chemical, and biological pharmacokinetics (PK) mechanisms at play, including drug deposition, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and various clearance mechanisms. The first step, drug deposition, depends mostly on the fluid-mechanics of lung morphology, breathing pattern, aerosol velocity, particle size and density. Only part of the dose will reach the target site in the lung whereas a significant fraction can remain in the inhalation device or be deposited in the mouth and throat. Due to the large spatial scales involved, understanding and predicting initial drug deposition relies on computational models and perfused animal lungs [264, 265] . Organ-on-Chip models have great potential, however, to aid modeling of many aspects of drug fate following deposition in different regions of the lung; this is in addition to providing insight into region-specific pharmacodynamic activity due to varying target expression and density throughout the lung. Specifically, for pulmonary absorption into tissue and blood circulation to occur, deposited drug particles have to (i) dissolve in the surface lining fluids, (ii) overcome various defense mechanisms by which the lung clears inhaled particles, including mechanical (i.e., mucociliary clearance), chemical (e.g., surfactant lipids, antiproteases), and immunological (e.g., phagocytosis) responses, (iii) pass the transepithelial air-blood barrier by passive diffusion or carrier-mediated active transport via paracellular or transcellular pathway, and (iv) withstand (or be activated by) the lung's metabolic activity [264] . The relative role of these mechanisms in drug absorption varies depending on airway region. For example, the conducting airways (nasal cavity, sinuses, nasopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles) are lined by ciliated cells and mucus-secreting cells, which together enable the mucociliary clearance of about 90% of inhaled particles, greatly reducing bioavailability of drug compounds [266] . In the respiratory regions, on the other hand, which comprise about 95% of the total surface area and consist of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs, drug bioavailability is limited by absorption, transport across the pulmonary air-blood barrier, and metabolic and macrophage clearance [267] . Because of the complexity of the lung morphology, the quantitative characterization of the in vivo interplay of all contributing factors either with in vitro assays or with in silico methods is an ongoing challenge. For example, rodents are generally exposed intratracheally or via nose-only inhalation, and hence the resulting plasma pharmacokinetics are a result of absorption from different regions of the lung [268] . Computational modeling approaches attempt to derive PK parameters mechanistically based on the physico-chemical characteristics of the drug (e.g., aqueous solubility) and the anatomical and physiological tissue properties, or, alternatively, from clinical PK data by means of statistical correlation; these approaches are limited by preexisting knowledge and data. Recently, there have also been microfluidic approaches to studying the dynamics and deposition of particles in true-scale, but cell-free, physical models of the pulmonary acinus which can help to isolate purely mechanical mechanisms [269] . Stem-cell based Lung-on-Chip models could complement these approaches and enable the empirical measurement of PK parameters of drug absorption at the cellular and tissue level. For example, local drug dissolution could be measured, which, especially for lipophilic drugs, can represent the rate-limiting process for pulmonary absorption. Further, temporal dynamics and patient-specific conditions can be revealed by recapitulating organ-specific barrier functions such as endothelial cell junctions and electrical resistance, presence of specific membrane transporters and metabolic enzymes, genotypic variation, disease conditions, and drug-drug interactions. Also, the effect of elimination processes such as mucociliary clearance on pulmonary bioavailability could be measured [270] . In addition, the flow environment of Organs-on-Chips enables the realistic test of time-dependent effects such as built-up of drug residue or drug carriers that can cause local toxicity [271] . The two principal challenges involved in the design and engineering of Lung-on-Chip models suitable for reproducible and scalable research are (i) to build the biology, i.e., to decide on the cells, ECM elements and the dynamic microenvironment that together enact the desired structure-function relationships of the organ [272] , and (ii) to build the chip hardware, i.e. to identify materials and geometries supporting study and maintenance of tissue biology that are at the same time amenable to reliable batch fabrication and application (Fig. 6 ). As discussed in great detail before, the main components determining the biology of the system are cell types, sources and architecture, ECM composition and distribution, and biomechanical forces such as flow shear and tissue strain. As with all model systems, tissue components and their mechanical properties have to be chosen carefully to achieve the structure-function relationships of interest without overly complexifying the system, which could mask important mechanisms, hinder reproducibility and make the results harder to interpret [273] . Complementary to the biological components, chip geometry and materials need to be chosen to provide appropriate structural support, implement the desired flow dynamics and mechanical forces, and support instrumentation for tissue maintenance and experimental readouts. Ideally, materials need to be non-toxic, optically clear, affordable, moldable or machinable, non-degrading under cell culture conditions, flexible to allow stretching, and not altering the chemistry of the fluid environment. Together, these criteria are difficult to achieve. For example, as discussed earlier, PDMS has been the material of choice for many proof-of-concept Organs-on-Chips designs; however, despite all its advantages for rapid prototyping, its use is sometimes limited by its tendency to absorb specific small hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds, encouraging the development of new, non-absorbing Organson-Chips materials [274] . Similarly, chip geometry constitutes a major factor in providing a physiologically-relevant environment amenable to sampling. While most Organs-on-Chips currently published feature rather simple flow circuits serving mostly perfusion and gas exchange, more sophisticated scenarios containing in-flow sensors and drug dispensers could be designed with the help of design and simulation software, as is routinely done for microfluidics applications [275] . However, introducing complex fluidic microchannel networks may increase bubble formation which could in turn damage cultures through shear forces and cells drying out when bubbles block medium perfusion. Eventually, however, the success of Lung-on-Chip models in achieving significant scientific impact will depend as much on the scientific merits as on its ease of use and fabrication, which directly relate to reproducibility of results across samples, experiments, and users, as well as scalability of experimental work to provide sufficient capacity. For this reason, efforts need to be directed towards achieving the same streamlining of chip manufacture as has happened in non-biological microfluidics [276] and towards developing user-friendly platforms that can support large-scale experimental work [277] . Considering all these aspects together when designing a chip seems a daunting prospect. However, other branches of industry dealing with complex micro-engineered systems, such as mechatronics, have developed a range of computational and simulation tools for optimizing design and fabrication based on desired usage goals and past experiences. These same tools have started to emerge in the Organs-on-Chips community, promising yet another technology transfer from electronical to biological micro-engineering [278] .@story_separate@The recent advances in the development of Organs-on-Chips and stem cell based organoids make their combination particularly attractive for studying dynamic processes in lung development, regeneration, and pathogenesis, as well as for personalized medicine. However, nowadays a multitude of models are available, and it needs to be noted that each approach has its merits. Therefore, it is essential that researchers adapt their choice of a model based on the research questions and logistic considerations. Thus far, Lung-on-Chip models have been developed and mostly employed in academic research to generate proof-ofconcept data. Broader accessibility of the technology and increased experimental throughput will enable the translation of this technology to pharmaceutical industry and clinical decision making. To meet the high expectations of Lung-on-Chip models, however, there is a need for a careful balance between continued increases in biological relevancy and complexity of the chip design on the one hand, and optimization for implementation in industry that requires greater reproducibility, capacity, and ease of use on the other hand. Meanwhile, patient-specific cells are already being used to predict the efficacy of drugs in the clinic; for example, in the Netherlands, the health care system covers the evaluation of cystic fibrosis drugs in patient-specific human organoids to assess whether a patient would benefit from the medication [183, 279] . Merging the two technologies to engineer patient-specific, stem-cell based Lung-on-Chip models will amplify their respective advantages and enable the design of human models for predicting efficacy and safety, drug-drug interactions, clinical trial applications and precision medicine. The demand for such models is expected to grow continuously, given that the current ban on animal testing for development of consumer products will likely expand from Europe (European Union Directive 76/768/EEC) to North America and worldwide, and given the pressing need for more predictive preclinical models for drug discovery and development. To enable such applications, however, the new Lungon-Chip models need to be held to stringent and uniform quality control criteria [280] . This is a formidable challenge as many different chip designs are currently being developed in academic laboratories, highlighting the need for creating standards and user guidelines, in addition to harnessing the inherent variability of the cell sources. One challenge is to balance the trade-off between increasing the biological complexity of the chip on one hand, and maintaining scalability of fabrication and ease of use on the other hand. In general, a greater degree of biological complexity will extend the range of functions that can be studied and are physiologically relevant, but might conversely impair economic factors, such as number of fabrication steps per sample, reproducibility of results, ease of use, throughput and volume of cells and reagents needed, and therefore slow down general adoption. To address this hurdle, US American funding agencies have started an initiative towards consolidating development of Organs-on-Chips and achieving robustness and replicability. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), in partnership with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the FDA, and more recently the pharmaceutical industry, has invested in academic teams and companies to develop Organs-on-Chips technology suitable for industry applications. These and other initiatives promise to address the challenges discussed in this review. If the current pace of innovation continues, we might soon witness the emergence of an ""ideal human lung model"" that can provide both large-scale screens of molecular level analysis of cell-cell interactions, and at the same time provide a platform to study or treat lung disorders with a personalized medicine approach.","Abstract Pathologies of the respiratory system such as lung infections, chronic inflammatory lung diseases, and lung cancer are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, killing one in six people worldwide. Development of more effective treatments is hindered by the lack of preclinical models of the human lung that can capture the disease complexity, highly heterogeneous disease phenotypes, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics observed in patients. The merger of two novel technologies, Organs-on-Chips and human stem cell engineering, has the potential to deliver such urgently needed models. Organs-on-Chips, which are microengineered bioinspired tissue systems, recapitulate the mechanochemical environment and physiological functions of human organs while concurrent advances in generating and differentiating human stem cells promise a renewable supply of patient-specific cells for personalized and precision medicine. Here, we discuss the challenges of modeling human lung pathophysiology in vitro, evaluate past and current models including Organs-on-Chips, review the current status of lung tissue modeling using human pluripotent stem cells, explore in depth how stem-cell based Lung-on-Chips may advance disease modeling and drug testing, and summarize practical consideration for the design of Lung-on-Chips for academic and industry applications."
"Digital advertising is the act of serving advertisements (""ads"") in different formats to visitors who consume online content on publishers' websites. It is a key source of revenue in media and entertainment domain: advertisers that set up an ad campaign receive revenue from the company ordering the campaign, and publishers receive money from advertisers to display ads. When setting up an ad campaign, advertisers specify which and how many ads are served (from one or more companies) as well as its format. In ad targeting, an advertiser also defines a pre-selected set of visitors based on various traits, e.g. geography, demographics, psychographics, browsing behavior, or past purchases. Ad targeting increases the probability of a visitor reacting positively compared to serving the same ad to every visitor [30] , and, thus, results in higher return on investment for both publishers and advertisers. The profile, the trait set of a visitor, needs to be captured, using observations via various complementary channels. For example, when Alice visits the sports page of a publisher's website more than eight times per month, that publisher -or a third-party tracker -adds the trait ""liking sports"" to Alice's profile (web browsing behavior observation). When Alice registers herself on that website and enters her birth date, her age range trait (e.g., 40-55) is also added to her profile (demographics observation). Alice can be targeted by the profile ""People over 35 years old liking sports"", as her profile matches, as long as sufficient consent was provided upfront by Alice. When more traits of Alice are captured, she can be targeted by more (and more specific) ads. However, profile data, and the revenue they entail, are unevenly distributed [3] : it was predicted that, in the first quarter of 2016, 85% of online advertising spendings would go to either Google or Facebook [14] . Such global publishers are media conglomerates and track visitors far beyond their own media properties. It is estimated that at least 68% of the most popular websites are tracked by Google [10] . These companies aggregate and centralize a large amount of data, and enable advertisers to create rich profiles. In contrast, local publishers hold only a fraction of visitor traits, as found on their own websites. Those traits are typically of higher quality compared to global companies, as local publishers have a closer relationship with their visitors. However, local publishers typically miss the opportunity to target visitors matching a requested profile, due to lack of scale, and, hence, miss out on revenue. Combining multiple local publishers' data can improve the profiling information and make their generated profiles -due to higher quality -competitive to global publishers. However, aggregating and centralizing all data understandably comes with limitations. Recent large-scale data scandals made the general public increasingly aware of the importance of privacy and control over personal data. The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union [9] enforces explicit, freely-given consent for sharing personal data. More, sharing all data across publishers would not be well received by the publishers, as this would result in loss of competitive advantage. The data should thus remain exclusive to each publisher. Using federated querying the data remains spread among -and under control of -publishers. However, it allows discovering visitors that adhere to a certain targeted profile, combining the relevant data from multiple publishers via federated querying. Linked Data [1] acts as an enabling technology: (i) the interoperable layer allows uniform and unambiguous trait descriptions across publishers and (ii) richer profiles are created via federated querying, while the data does not need to be shared across publishers. The usage of semantic technologies, thus, allows local publishers to join forces, leveling the playing field with global companies. Local publishers and advertisers do not need to fully share their data, whilst improving ad targeting. A solution based on federated querying is devised mapping publisher's custom trait definitions to a common SKOS vocabulary [20] , generating RDF datasets using RML [7] and queried using Comunica [26] . This solution is applied to and deployed in the media landscape of Flanders, Belgium, as it is explained at https://vimeo.com/374617281. A consortium was formed, dubbed EcoDaLo, consisting of complementary partners to deploy this interoperable layer: Adlogix, Pebble Media, and Roularta Media Group. We present the role semantic technologies play in EcoDaLo, allowing federated advertisement targeting in Belgium. After introducing the use case (Sect. 2), we present our application (Sect. 3). Our approach was showcased by multiple companies in Belgium (Sect. 4), allowing federated integration of traits to improve targeting across local publishers. We functionally evaluate our solution (Sect. 5), present related work (Sect. 6), and conclude by discussing privacy and ethical considerations as well as key features of our solution (Sect. 7).@story_separate@The EcoDaLo consortium is one of the first collaborations where publishers remain in exclusive control of data they collected, and a decentralized deployment is attained. Three complementary funding consortium partners participate in EcoDaLo. AdLogix is a development company experienced in digital advertising, which developed multiple advertising products on the international market 1 . It is responsible for providing technical support to build a production-ready system that can be used by both advertisers and publishers. Pebble Media is a digital sales house, representing the role of advertiser, with many partnerships in the local market 2 . Roularta Media Group is a multimedia group, representing the role of publisher, and market leader in the field of radio and television, magazines, and local media in Flanders 3 . As domain experts, Pebble Media and Roularta Media Group are responsible for providing technical requirements, aligned with the current advertising industry landscape. As all bases are covered by the different consortium partners, the devised solution remains in line with industrial perspectives, and chances of successful impact increases. Motivating Example. Alice visits the websites of publishers A and B (Fig. 1) . The publishers have different ways of identifying Alice's traits. Publisher A knows her age range because Alice registered her birth date: Alice is identified with id A123 and she gets assigned trait A over 35 (Fig. 1, 1 ) . Publisher B -specialized in football content -deduces that Alice is football lover, because she visits any of the publisher's web pages more than once a week: Alice is identified with id B456, she gets assigned trait B likes football (Fig. 1, 2 ) . None of the publishers can provide enough traits to match Alice to ""sports lovers over 35"" (Fig. 1, 3 ) . And even if publishers could combine their user traits, it is not clear whether a football lover qualifies as a sports lover or not. EcoDaLo aims to enable this potential, semantically -i.e., meaningfully -combining the captured data, and serve Alice relevant advertisements, targeted at the requested profile. Fig. 1 . Publisher A knows Alice is over 35 years old, and Publisher B that she likes football. However, Alice cannot be targeted, as her captured traits from different publishers cannot be combined. EcoDaLo aims to improve ad targeting by combining visitor data across publishers. This allows leveling the playing field between local and global publishers: local publishers can target more visitors, and their captured visitor traits are of higher quality compared to those of global publishers. Typically, integrating all publishers' data results in an additional ad server having access to a large amount of data. This provides a global fine-grained view of every individual visitor, and allows detailed analysis over all data. However, it also requires publishers to give up control over the data they captured (Fig. 2, left) . The addressed challenges include cross-publisher targeting without sharing all data and providing an extensible and scalable framework to various new partners. We chose to keep the data spread across publishers, and let a separate neutral party do federated querying on the level of captured visitor traits, using unambiguous semantic descriptions, instead of integrating all publisher's individual observations. For example, not every observation that Alice visits a football page is shared across publishers, only Publisher B's (aggregated) captured trait that Alice likes football is taken into account during federated querying. Also the aggregated captured trait is not shared with other publishers, it is only taken into account by the federated query layer. The combination of federated querying, and only considering the captured visitor traits instead of all data, alleviates privacy concerns, improves scaling behavior, and exploits existing infrastructure. The disadvantage is that ad targeting by combining visitor traits is not as fine-grained as integrating all data. For example, it is not possible to target visitors that ""visited at least three sports pages across all publishers in the last 10 days"", as such information is not shared. Visitors' privacy is protected to a certain extent: no fine-grained information is shared across consortium partners. Visitors are, to this point still, identifiable across publishers, but the captured traits (and links from these traits to unique visitors) remain under (exclusive) control of the publishers. The business rules of how those traits are captured remain exclusive to the individual publishers. The solution scales as less data needs to be federated: a captured trait can be an aggregation from a large number of historical observations. Considering only the aggregations can reduce the amount of data by multiple orders of magnitude. Publishers' existing trait capture infrastructure is reused, compared to installing a large new trait capture infrastructure. The existing infrastructure -optimized to aggregate large amounts of (historical) data to capture traitsremains unaltered: its output, i.e., the discovered visitor traits, serves as a data source for the federated querying. This reduces development effort for the consortium partners, and increases the chances of adoption by more publishers. In this section, we provide a high-level overview (Sect. 3.1) and an example (Sect. 3.2), after which we discuss our design considerations (Sect. 3.3). Our solution consists of three main components (Fig. 2 , right): (i) The EcoDaLo ad server -auxiliary to the pre-existing ad servers used by each respective publisher -targets and serves ads to visitors across publishers (Fig. 2, 3 ) . This ad server only provides the common identifier; the visitor traits remain under the individual publishers' control. (ii) Each publisher provides a semantic layer, exposing the captured visitor traits mapped to an interoperable unambiguous trait model (Fig. 2, 1 ). (iii) A federated querying intermediate layer connects the additional ad server with the individual publishers (Fig. 2, 2 ) . Due to the explicit semantics, we provide an interoperable layer, extensible to new partners. Using our solution, Alice can be targeted by combining multiple traits from different publishers (Fig. 3 ). Alice visits a website of Publisher A as a registered visitor (Fig. 3, 1 ). She is identified as new visitor within EcoDaLo (EcoDaLo id E1, 2 ). Alice then browses some football pages of Publisher B as an unregistered user 3 . She is recognized as existing visitor within EcoDaLo 4 . When a new campaign is launched, the trait combinations are queried, federated over the different publishers 5 ). The mapping to a common trait model is used to query the individual publisher's captured traits, e.g., over 35 is found mapped from A over 35, and sports lover mapped from B likes football. When Alice then visits a consortium publisher, such as Publisher A, her set of captured visitor traits is sent to the EcoDaLo ad server 6 . Alice's trait set matches with the mapped target set, Alice is targeted by the campaign, and a relevant ad is served 7 . Her EcoDaLo id E1 makes sure the number of times Alice gets served a specific ad is monitored correctly, even when she visits Publisher B. During ad targeting, Alice is not uniquely identified, i.e., her EcoDaLo id is not used during federated querying, only during ad serving. Thus, the explicit link between Alice and her captured traits is never stored in the EcoDaLo ad server. Each publisher has its own trait definitions. This influences ad campaign definitions and visitor targeting. Before defining an ad campaign, a common, unambiguous trait model is needed for the traits targeted by advertisers, those captured by publishers, and the relationships between them. For example, Publisher A captures three age ranges (""<18"", ""18-35"", "">35""), and Publisher B captures five age ranges (""<18"", ""18-25"", ""25-35"", ""35-65"", "">65""): the targeted trait ""over 35"" is mapped differently for Publisher A and Publisher B. A semantic model further allows description of trait relations, e.g., the relationship between Publisher B's captured ""likes football"" and the more general ""sports lover"" can be specified. Instead of requiring all consortium partners to alter their system and impose usage of a common trait model, publishers map their existing captured traits to a common model. This increases flexibility: a single captured trait can be mapped to multiple common traits, and a combination of captured traits can be mapped to a single common trait. This increases the chances of adoption as changes in the publishers' pre-existing infrastructure and required effort are minimized. A visitor can thus be targeted by combining the captured traits across publishers, and served a relevant ad. However, to monitor how many ads are served to how many distinct visitors, a shared identification mechanism is still needed. Multiple options were considered to identify visitor across publishers, among others, machine learning and browser fingerprinting: Machine learning techniques could help identify individual visitors based on their combination of traits. However, more detailed data is not available -given that no fine-grained observations are shared -and this would require to create a training set of visitors and addressing the related emerging privacy concerns. Browser fingerprints [18] provide a quasi-unique identification mechanism by combining visitors' browser and hardware traits, e.g., installed plugins, screen resolution, etc. The identification is not 100% accurate, and identification is limited to visitors using a single browser and device. However, these options were dismissed due to the inability to provide 100% accurate results. Given the domain, where inaccuracies are already manifold (e.g., visitors using multiple devices, sharing the same accounts, etc.), the consortium decided not to add more inaccuracies. Instead, we use the EcoDaLo ad server as identifying service, which provides and explicitly links common (Eco-DaLo) ids to the visitor ids of each consortium partner. The ad server only stores its own generated ids, mapped to the ids of the individual publishers. For example, when Alice first visits Publisher A, she is not yet identified within EcoDaLo, the ad server creates a new common EcoDaLo id E1, and connects this id with A123, Alice's id of Publisher A (Fig. 3, 2 ) . When Alice later visits Publisher B, given her previously assigned EcoDaLo id E1, the ad server is updated and Publisher B's id B456 is added (Fig. 3, 4 ) . EcoDaLo's technical considerations include setting up the EcoDaLo ad server (Sect. 4.1), using a common trait model (Sect. 4.2), mapping each publisher's traits to that common trait model (Sect. 4.3), federating the traits (Sect. 4.4), and exposing the results to the EcoDaLo ad server (Sect. 4.5). The (development) effort for partners to integrate with the EcoDaLo set-up is kept low to increase potential uptake and growth of the consortium. The EcoDaLo ad server: (i) provides common visitor ids across consortium partners, (ii) serves ads of campaigns set up within the EcoDaLo consortium, and (iii) monitors the number of ads served to distinct visitors. As such, established pre-existing ad server software can be used to fulfill multiple requirements. We employ an ad server that provides identifiers for every visitor of any website within the consortium. Each publisher needs to modify its websites, allowing access to the EcoDaLo ad server to add these identifiers. The expected effort is reasonable, as the publishers would need to support ads served due to campaigns set up in EcoDaLo in any case. Publishers that advertise are already required to gather GDPR-compliant visitor's consent for ad targeting involving third-parties, i.e. informing the user who will have access to which information for which purpose. Thus, no additional effort regarding the consent gathering setup is needed compared to existing solutions. We use an interoperable, semantic model to describe the common traits, as it enables meaningful federation across publishers. We provide a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) taxonomy [20] based on the IAB Technology Laboratory's Audience Taxonomy 1.0 4 as common trait model. The IAB Technology Laboratory (IAB Tech Lab) is an international nonprofit consortium that helps companies implement global advertising industry technical standards and solutions. We only considered IABs audience taxonomy as a possible common trait model, other trait models can be used or created instead. This taxonomy is available at http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/iab/at 1-0, mapped from the originally published taxonomy to SKOS using YARRRML [6, 15] , and processed as RML rules [7, 8] . The mapping rules are available at http://semweb.mmlab.be/ ns/iab/mapping/iab audience.mapping.yaml and http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/ iab/mapping/iab audience.mapping.rml.ttl. The modeling effort is limited compared to the typical approach where all publishers' data is integrated: only the traits need to be modeled, as opposed to all types of publisher observations and descriptions of how observations lead to a captured trait. For example, we do not need to model that the set of observations ""visiting at least three football pages the last 10 days"" is used to capture the ""football lover""-trait. The use of a declarative mapping language allows for possibly fine-grained mappings including the use of functions but can also be created manually in a hard-coded fashion. In any case, we provide a transparent and maintainable process, adaptable for change, as the Audience Taxonomy is currently released for public comment. Each publisher is required to provide a mapping of the captured internal traits to the common ones. This mapping can be many-to-many, across multiple levels. For example, ""football lover"" is mapped to ""Sports-American Football"" and the more general ""Sports"", and ""tennis lover"" is -next to ""Sports-Tennis""also mapped to ""Sports"". More granular mappings can be taken into account, e.g., distinguishing the levels of interest of a ""football lover"". The Resource Description Framework (RDF) [5] is useful to describe the mapping, as it natively allows to unambiguously link concepts in complex relationships. For usability reasons, consortium partners -which are non-Semantic Web experts -do not need to manually write RDF triples. Instead, they provide a mapping of their custom captured traits to the common trait model, by means of a CSV file with three columns: the publisher's captured internal trait id and label, and the common trait id from the IAB Audience Taxonomy. This CSV file is then used to generate the RDF dataset mapping each publishers' internal traits to the common trait model. The generation description is written in YARRRML [6, 15] , a representation of RML [7, 8] (Listing 1): the generation process remains maintainable, whilst consortium partners are not bothered with the details of how RDF triples are generated. Every time the mapping changes, i.e., when a publisher captures new visitor traits, the RDF dataset is regenerated and republished. We provide a transparent and maintainable generation process, adaptable for change, by using RML. The generation description remains user-friendly relying on a CSV configuration document: CSV is easily handled using standard office suites, and a common export format for many software packages.  Federated querying of cross-publisher traits is enabled using the generated interoperable RDF datasets of each publisher. Each publisher's mapping dataset is generated in HDT format [11, 19] , and published as a Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) endpoint [29] . The federated query engine Comunica [26] queries over the TPF endpoints of each publisher, and over the published SKOS Audience Taxonomy. An example of a federated query for all captured traits is shown in Listing 2. The traits are found across all publishers (line 11), and returned with their preferred label from the published SKOS Audience Taxonomy (line 15). Publishing results using TPF endpoints in lower server-side CPU usage -thus requiring minimal investment of the consortium partners -and -in combination with Comunica -delivers state-of-the-art federated querying performance [29] . A JSON(-LD) [25] API is provided that exposes the results of federated SPARQL queries, easing integration with the EcoDaLo ad server. The JSON-LD context hides the individual URI prefixes. This API is consumed (daily) by the EcoDaLo ad server, to have an updated view of the consortium partners' captured traits. In an initial stage, the complexities of using RDF are hidden from the partners, which lowers the threshold for new partners to join the consortium: no prior Semantic Web knowledge is needed. The consortium collected focus groups to make sure the devised solution is in line with the industry's common practices. All decisions were communicated in faceto-face meetings, and feedback was gathered using the think-aloud method [24] . We discuss a launched campaign that evaluate the added benefit of EcoDaLo and compare EcoDaLo to other approaches based on six identified features. Our devised solution reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5: we implemented and validated it in a relevant environment within a launched advertisement campaign in the end of August 2019 in Flanders, Belgium. The Belgian university Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) 5 acts as client in the launched campaign and wants to target (potential) students to maximize the registrations for the open VUB day on September 7th 2019 6 . The campaign targets (combinations of) both overlapping and complementary captured visitor traits of both Roularta Media Group and Pebble Media in different advertising formats, such as ""half page"" or ""mobile leaderboard"". Additionally we measured the traffic to the website of the open day at VUB using a tracking pixel. Our devised solution has been presented to the industrial partners and served as technological base for the described campaign. Around 1.84 million impressions were delivered by Pebble Media and 1.03 million via Roularta Media Group; VUB reported that compared to last year 300 extra people were registered for the open day. Additionally industry partners using our solution reported insights in different renumeration models, i.e. how to split revenue based on provided knowledge about visitor traits and advertising format of the impression. To evaluate the added benefit of EcoDaLo, we perform a functional evaluation of six features, comparing EcoDaLo (trait federation) to the status quo of a local publisher, a global publisher, and an integration approach (Table 1) . Trait quality. The trait quality of a local publisher is -due to the localityhigher compared to those of a global publisher. This high quality is retained when integrating the captured data or federating the traits. compared to integration where all observation types must be mapped to a common model; which still requires effort but less. Interoperability. Integration slightly improves interoperability by using common definitions, as compared to the closed environment of local and global publishers. However, the Linked Data principles renders the federation approach entirely interoperable and machine-understandable. Maintainability. Attention was put into improving the maintainability of the federation approach, specifically, into maintainability of the common trait model generation and the trait mapping description. We describe related work regarding privacy, semantic web and advertisement. Online behavioral advertisement (OBA) is controversial: on the one hand, it creates more relevant and efficient ads, on the other hand raises privacy concerns as it is based on personal data. For a complete overview of the topic we refer the reader to the literature review of Boerman et al. [2] . The W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies and Controls community group developed a vocabulary to annotate and categorize instances of legally compliant personal data handling [23] . This is complementary to our solution as their vocabulary describes consent and data processing purposes in EcoDaLo. The SPECIAL project proposed a privacy-aware big data architecture focused on consent management and compliance verification [17] . It was developed in parallel with EcoDaLo. SPECIAL's sticky privacy policies, data use constraints attached to data, could be realized within EcoDaLo by also mapping consent-related information from publishers to a common data model, similar to visitor trait data, providing the added feature of ex-ante compliance checking. Publishers join forces by introducing an integration component that allows aggregating all involved publishers' captured data [21] . This requires considerable development effort, tailored to existing publishers' data stores and detailed privacy-compliance considerations. As such, a federated approach for querying captured visitor traits is, to the best of our knowledge, novel for ad targeting. Usage of Semantic Web technologies to enable trait federation in the media and entertainment domain was not yet investigated. Existing related work instead focuses on automatically generating meaningful targeting profiles, by (i) classifying content and ads to form one knowledge graph, and (ii) using that knowledge graph to improve ad recommendation algorithms: The semantic classification is either created manually [28] , or content and ads are classified automatically to a common predefined knowledge graph [4] . Choosing between manual or automatic classification typically introduces a trade-off between quality and scalability. When improving the quality of the automatic classification, existing Linked Open Data graphs are used to complete the knowledge graph [13] , and the explicit semantics are exploited to provide detailed tagging of content and ads [12] . During recommendation, typically, graph distance metrics are used as a measure of relatedness [31] , an approach applied successfully in the academic publishing domain [27] . For EcoDaLo, ad targeting profiles are created manually by the advertiser. Related work is thus complementary, enabling improvements as future work: recommendation methods can be used to suggest inclusion or exclusion of certain traits when specifying an ad campaign. The misuse of personal data, especially for discrimination, is unethical and illegal; transparency and ethical guidelines may address this issue. Intransparency regarding the use of data collected via online behavioral advertising may be harmful and unethical if consumers are unaware [2] . The GDPR addresses transparency with respect to user-awareness about which personal data 7 is shared with whom and for which purpose by listing obligations regarding valid consent obtainment. Recent court rulings applied these regulations on concrete cases [16] emphasizing on explicit opt-in to give consent. For EcoDaLo, users need to be aware which personal data of which EcoDaLo publisher is used for the purpose of online advertisement, including awareness regarding participating publishers. Users then have to explicitly give consent for this purpose, i.e. they explicitly have to opt-in. EcoDaLo assumes that publishers and advertisers act with good faith following relevant ethical guidelines [22] which goes beyond the presented technical solution. Hiding the complexities of using semantic technologies increases the potential uptake by new consortium partners. Consortium partners are not confronted with RDF triples or ontologies but, instead, rely on developer-friendly formats such as CSV and JSON. The federated querying layer and interoperable machine-understandable model are made transparent, lowering effort for consortium partners and increasing chances of enlarging the consortium. Although explicit semantics are currently hidden for consortium partners, (future) advantages are gained, compared to using an ad-hoc integration layer. Unambiguous machine-understandable trait definitions increase interoperability, and make it easier for new members to join the consortium. Reasoning can be applied to automatically enrich knowledge graph: implicit links between common traits can be discovered. For future work, we investigate in a complementary validation component of the federated querying which i.a. can filter results which are too narrow and could harm privacy. Also, we look into the influence of using fine-grained traits and applying more advanced queries, a.o., taking into account a captured trait's confidence level. For example, when the trait ""likes sports"" is captured with a low confidence level by multiple publishers, this can be combined as a single ""likes sports"" trait with higher confidence.@story_separate@Advertising is a monetary stimulus for individuals to share their data with publishers and advertisers, in exchange for content. Although not the only option, it is very common in the media and entertainment domain. Lately, awareness rises concerning the trade-off between respecting an individual's privacy and increasing advertising revenue. In EcoDaLo, we introduce an interoperable semantic layer among local publishers allowing to exploit high-quality visitor traits using federated querying, without sharing data among consortium partners. We conclude by discussing privacy and ethical considerations, key features of our approach as well as outlining future work.","A key source of revenue for the media and entertainment domain is ad targeting: serving advertisements to a select set of visitors based on various captured visitor traits. Compared to global media companies such as Google and Facebook that aggregate data from various sources (and the privacy concerns these aggregations bring), local companies only capture a small number of (high-quality) traits and retrieve an unbalanced small amount of revenue. To increase these local publishers’ competitive advantage, they need to join forces, whilst taking the visitors’ privacy concerns into account. The EcoDaLo consortium, located in Belgium and consisting of Adlogix, Pebble Media, and Roularta Media Group as founding partners, aims to combine local publishers’ data without requiring these partners to share this data across the consortium. Usage of Semantic Web technologies enables a decentralized approach where federated querying allows local companies to combine their captured visitor traits, and better target visitors, without aggregating all data. To increase potential uptake, technical complexity to join this consortium is kept minimal, and established technology is used where possible. This solution was showcased in Belgium which provided the participating partners valuable insights and suggests future research challenges. Perspectives are to enlarge the consortium and provide measurable impact in ad targeting to local publishers."
"March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. 1 When faced with such a major crisis, our mental health can be affected. On the other hand, some mental health-related characteristics help us resist and survive. Constant worries regarding uncontrollable threats may lead to anxiety, depression, and unhealthy responses to stress, reducing tolerance and empathy. [2] [3] [4] [5] Exacerbated by the accompanying infodemic, 6 the negative consequences on medical staff are expected to increase in such difficult working conditions. Stress is defined as the assessment of a situation that exceeds coping resources, 7 and is an issue that frequently occurs in the healthcare professionals. 7, 8 Research shows that stress might cause symptoms of anxiety, depression, 9, 10 emotional exhaustion, 11 tense relationships, 12 and lower job satisfaction. 8 These issues correlate with a higher frequency of burnout, 13 and a lower quality of life. 14 During previous disease outbreaks, the healthcare workers manifested psychological distress and psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression and stress, fear of self-infection, concern about infecting family and friends, uncertainty and stigmatization, all with possible long-term psychological implications. [15] [16] [17] Empathy is a fundamental value for the healthcare, enabling professionals to understand and share a patient's feelings and perspective. 16 Patients prefer to relate to professionals who are competent, but also have adequate interpersonal and emotional skills. 9, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Research has shown that patients' trust in medical staff, and empathic care lead to greater adherence to treatment and better health outcomes. 23, 24 Doubtless, empathy is a core element of effective care, although it also creates vulnerability to stress, emotional exhaustion, and burnout. [25] [26] [27] Most authors see the concept as having two dimensions (ie, emotive, cognitive), but Wilkinson et al 18 described it as having two additional dimensions (ie, behavioral and moral) that should be targeted for organizational cultural interventions. Burnout is defined as physical exhaustion, helplessness, decreased motivation to work or live, usually as a result of prolonged stress or frustration. [28] [29] [30] [31] Burnout among healthcare professionals is a gradual process developing over time and has been characterized as a major concern. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] The relationship between burnout and empathy is widely acknowledged, but there have been inconclusive research results in establishing the direction and nature of this relationship, [38] [39] [40] with widely accepted evidence supporting a negative correlation. 18, 41, 42 Burnout is related to the stress of one's professional activity, while empathy is an individual human trait; three current hypotheses are explored in related research: exhaustion decreases the ability of medical staff to respond empathetically, being empathetic can lead to exhaustion, and being empathetic protects against burnout. Perceived organizational support evaluates employees' perception and acknowledgement of effective role fulfillment, 43 and was identified as a moderator for the relationship between work and work-related outcomes. 44 Successful planning and implementation of interventions towards supporting healthcare workers' mental health, reducing physicians' vulnerability, and preparing for health emergencies has been a constant concern. 34, [45] [46] [47] The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was a period of high pressure on healthcare workers and heavy strain on the healthcare system's resources. The goals of this research were to: (1) assess the psychological distress associated with work-related experiences during the outbreak; (2) evaluate the burnout during the outbreak; (3) identify the modifiable factors associated with empathy among healthcare workers during that period.@story_separate@An online cross-sectional survey was employed for data collection. It was distributed to healthcare professionals working under the supervision of the county-level healthcare authority and the professional coordination of the ""Pius Branzeu"" Emergency Hospital, a tertiary hospital affiliated with ""Victor Babes"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Timisoara, Timis County, Romania. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the ""Pius Branzeu"" Emergency Hospital (ID 191, assigned on 5 Mar 2020) and it complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data collection and analysis followed the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The participants were recruited via their professional contact information, and the survey started with information about the study's goals and personal data protection. For each individual, data collection proceeded after informed consent had been granted by participants (a required confirmation was included as the first questionnaire's item). First-contact professionals were asked to disseminate the information and the survey link. The online data collection was active for 20 days, between 28 April and 17 May 2020, and ended when there were two consecutive days with only one respondent. In total, the survey gathered information from 364 professionals (ie, doctors, nurses, and administrative staff) with a response rate of 12.62% (out of 2884 total targeted staff). Administrative and clerical personnel were included for their important role in coordinating and facilitating patient care. The data form did not require any identification information (ie, anonymous) but offered the option to fill-in an e-mail address for receiving personalized feedback and the possibility of further contact. All the other items were required. Less than 40% of the respondents provided identification information, with no distinct patterns across gender, age, or professional status. The online form was created on a survey platform and gathered socio-demographic data (ie, age group, gender, marital status); information on the level of career, professional responsibilities, and whether the respondents were on the frontline of pandemic engagement; indicators of stress and psychological functioning; perceived support in the professional and family environment (both as dichotomic variables). The 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) was used to assess the severity of perceived anxiety symptoms. 48 On HARS, answers are rated on a 5-point scale, summing a total score that ranges from 0 to 70. HARS is a clinician-based questionnaire that may also be employed as a self-scored survey. Depression was measured with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), validated for the Romanian population. 49, 50 On PHQ-9, each of the nine items is scored by the subject on a scale from 0 (""not at all"") to 3 (""nearly every day""). The total possible score ranges from 0 to 27 points, with values over 14 as a trend toward severe depression. Experienced burnout was assessed with the 16-item Maslach Burnout Inventory -General Survey (MBI-GS), including three dimensions: emotional exhaustion (five items), cynicism-depersonalization (five items), and diminished professional efficacy (six items). 31, 51 The MBI-GS was previously used for the assessment of Romanian healthcare professionals. 51 The 25-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) was used to gauge the respondents' levels of resilience. 52 It had been translated and used with the Romanian population. 53 A subscale of the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) was employed for empathy. 54 The Romanianvalidated version IPIP-Ro was applied, on a scale from 1 to 8 (the higher the score, the higher the level of empathy). 55 The actual measurements' distribution was strongly skewed towards the high end of the scale, with almost 80% of the values at the maximum eight, thus having little discriminating power over the scale range. Therefore, we decided to further analyze this assessment as a binary variable: having/showing either empathy (the maximum score on the scale) or little/lack of empathy (smaller scores). Descriptive statistics included the observed frequency counts (percentage) for category variables and median (Inter Quartile Range) for numerical variables. Univariate non-parametric statistical tests were applied to compare the distribution of the questionnaires' scale data across two or multiple groups, as appropriate (either Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests, respectively). The Chi-square statistical test (either asymptotic or Monte-Carlo simulation with 10,000 samples) was applied to check the statistical significance of the association between the category variables. A multivariate nonparametric model was employed for investigating the effect of working conditions and professional or socio-demographic factors on the questionnaires' measurements, when the outcome variables proved statistically significant in preliminary univariate analysis of those factors. The Shapiro-Wilk statistical test (in both uni-and multivariate versions) was employed for testing the normality, and the Box's test was used for checking the multivariate homogeneity. For the nonparametric multivariate testing (when the assumptions for the MANOVA test were not met), a permutation simulation with 1000 replicates was applied to obtain the reported p-values. A stepwise logistic regression model was applied with empathy as the outcome, and the working conditions, professional and socio-demographic factors, or questionnaires' scale data as possible independent predictors, based on the preliminary univariate analysis (when p<0.15). 56 The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to select the best fitting model when conducting the logistic regression. A mediation model was analyzed, with empathy as the outcome and the causal step strategy was employed for testing the mediation hypotheses. [57] [58] [59] For estimating the specific direct and causal mediation effects, the biascorrected and accelerated bootstrap re-sampling strategy (with 1000 bootstrap samples) was applied. 59, 60 For all scales, the actual reliability of the measurements was assessed based on Cronbach's alpha. Values > 0.8 were considered as proving good internal consistency for this applied research. 61 The statistical analysis was conducted at a 95% level of confidence and a 5% level of statistical significance. All reported probability values were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed with the statistical software IBM-SPSS v. 25 and R 3.6.3 packages (including ""mvnormtest"", ""ICSNP"", ""npmv"", and ""mediation""). Three hundred and sixty-four professionals were included in this study (73 males, 20 .1%) and approximately 60% of them were between 31 and 50 years old. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the socio-demographic and professional data. We considered the current professional status as comprising information on the age group and level of education, therefore the subsequent statistical analysis was conducted using this comprehensive variable. Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics for the scale measurements: the resilience and the empathy proved to be different for the two genders. Of the 364 respondents, 14.83% were slightly depressed (PHQ-9 scores over 4) and 29.67% reported an anxious mood (HARS scores over 4), with higher scores on both scales among those who operated in the frontline ""red area"", although no evident relationship was found between levels of professional responsibility (coordinators versus non-coordinators). Tables 3 and 4 show the scales' scores in relation to professional status (with a statistically significant association for most of them), the coordination responsibilities (higher resilience for coordinators, with highly significant difference, p=0.004), and the activity in frontline ""red area"" (higher PHQ-9 scores, statistically significant for the frontline workers, p=0.018). Table 5 presents the association of perceived support with the psychological scales' scores: the lack of support from the professional environment seemed decisive for higher anxiety and stress, and less resilience and empathy, with highly significant statistical association (p<0.01). The multivariate testing proved the statistically significant association of the scales' measurements with the professional categories, activity in COVID-19 red areas, and professional support. The scales' measurements showed no relationship with the respondents' desire to receive personalized feedback (thus providing their identity and contact information), except for the resilience scale: those requesting feedback proved to be more resilient (Mann-Whitney U-test, p=0.007). Table 6 shows the results of the step-wise logistic regression analysis with empathy as the outcome. Models 0, 1, 2, and 3 were built applying a step-wise logistic regression employing AIC for model selection. Based on Model 3, the odds of empathy among women were more than twice those among men (2.26 = 1/0.442) for healthcare professionals with the same burnout-depersonalization scoring, perceived professional support, total scoring on the resilience scale, professional status, and marital status: OR=2.26, 95% CI (1.21; 4.22) . Each additional scoring point on the burnout-depersonalization scale decreased the empathy odds at a ratio of OR=0.93, 95% CI (0.89; 0.97) while controlling for other factors in the model. The lack of professional support accounted for higher Maslach B depersonalization scoring, with high statistical significance ( Table 5) : median (Inter Quartile Range) of 2 (0-6) versus 7 (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) for the groups who acknowledged as receiving professional support versus those who did not, respectively. Figure 1 is a graphical representation of the triad-type relationship between professional support, burnout-depersonalization, and empathy or lack of empathy. Taking all these into consideration, the causal mediation model of burnout-depersonalization role on the association between professional support and the empathy of healthcare professionals is proposed (shown in Figure 2 ). For estimating the specific direct and causal mediation effects of professional support on empathy, for which this model accounts, the bias corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap resampling was applied to determine the confidence intervals. Table 7 and Figure 3 present the results. The total effect of the professional support on empathy was mainly generated through the mediation mechanism, ie burnout-depersonalization in the case of no professional support. The causal mediation effect was highly significant, while the direct effect was negligible. The interaction between the perceived professional support and burnout was non-significant (as it was proven in the step-wise logistic regression analysis, as well). In Romania, there are certain work-related conditions that have changed. Since the beginning of the pandemic, all Romanian hospitals were organized into ""first phase"", ""second phase"", and ""support"" institutions. First phase hospitals (ie, infectious disease hospitals) are designated to treat patients with COVID-19, in moderate, severe, and critical forms. Second phase hospitals house patients with COVID-19, when the available first phase beds are outnumbered. In the second phase and support hospitals, distinct circuits were implemented for COVID-19 patients. All staff were instructed to implement prevention and protective measures. Regular workload and organizations' working styles suffered dramatic changes, which put high pressure on healthcare workers. The burnout syndrome among Romanian healthcare workers has been identified. 62, 63 We aimed to evaluate the psychological distress associated with the work-related experiences of medical professionals and supporting staff during the pandemic outbreak.  Regarding psychological outcomes, we found higher resilience for female versus male healthcare workers, and coordinators versus non-coordinators. Moreover, professionals working in the frontline ""red area"" seemed more resilient and the trainees were the least resilient (although the differences did not reach statistical significance). focus their research on individuals' characteristics and identify psychosocial risk factors. Interestingly for our study, the respondents who chose to provide personal contact information and requested feedback proved to be more resilient, but no other distinguishable patterns were found.  Although the PHQ-9 scores were not particularly high in this survey sample, a rather slight depression was reported, with increased levels among the frontline workers. Physicians seemed more depressed than nurses, with young doctors being the most affected. Moreover, trainee doctors reported a heavy burden of anxiety and a lower level of empathy. Research conducted to date has presented contradicting results regarding these aspects, although most articles reported high levels of depression and/or anxiety, and overall psychological problems for healthcare workers during this pandemic, [66] [67] [68] which is similar to other reports on mental health risks during disasters in the past. 69 The individuals' experience of burnout was significantly heavier among physicians compared to nurses, and higher for workers on the frontline. Burnout among physicians has been acknowledged as a global problem. 33, 35, 36 Increased burnout has also been reported in Romanian medical staff after the start of this pandemic, with even higher levels in trainees. 62 Different protective factors against burnout, such as training, continuing education, supervision, recognition, and continuous feedback were underlined in these specific circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania. 63 For all respondents, perceived family support seemed to play a relieving role, but did not have a significant impact. On the other hand, the reported professional support made an important and significant difference across all the psychological measurements (ie, anxiety, depression, burnout, and resilience). The missing professional support was also decisive for the missing empathy. The relationship between burnout and empathy has been assiduously investigated. 18, 34, 40, 70, 71 In our study, female professionals seemed by far more empathetic than their male co-workers (80.8% versus 64.4%). Trainee doctors seemed to be the least empathetic, an issue that could be related to their higher levels of depression and anxiety, and lower levels of resilience. It has been suggested that women are more empathetic than their male peers. 72, 73 A possible explanation might be that women are, biologically, more inclined to manifest empathy and assume a caregiver's role. [74] [75] [76]  The constructed regression model proved the high odds towards empathy among women and the significant loss of empathy related to the depersonalization component of the burnout experience. The regression analysis we conducted also brought forward the role of professional support in sustaining empathy towards others (either patients or coworkers), regardless of the individuals' personality dimensions or characteristics, such as professional or marital status, or even their resilience. The causal direction in the relationship between burnout and empathy has been a matter of debate and contradictory associations have been reported. 34, 40, 71 Wilkinson et al 18 provided consistent evidence for a negative association between burnout and empathy, acknowledging them both as fundamental contributory elements to the quality of healthcare. Team-based models of care and educational solutions have been proposed for preventing the burnout and addressing the cognitive dimension of empathy. 33, 34, 47 Empathy should be seen not only as a trait, but as a dynamic factor that can be improved by indirect measures aimed at reducing the burnout or improving the work environment, and implementing a work culture centered on human wellbeing, of employees and patients alike. Measuring empathy might provide additional information regarding the implement of such change. We propose a mediation model for the relationship of professional support -burnout -empathy, based on the role-shifting of burnout from effect to cause, depending on the focus of the analysis. The model in this applied research arguably clarifies the decisive role of professional support in preventing the burnout and the subsequent loss of empathy. The mediator would explain how external physical facts or events take on internal psychological significance. A lack of social support has been reported as related to the emergence of psychiatric disorders during this pandemic. 77 Similarly, a positive work environment, trusted leadership, and helpful professional relationships had been considered to be protective elements against the burnout. 78 These reports would confirm our findings. Burnout and depersonalization are recognized as being related to anxiety, stress, and other psychiatric disorders. [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] Likewise, empathy is connected with professional efficacy and burnout. 18, 83 The model we propose is in concordance with existing information about systemic interrelations in the workplace. The quality of the healthcare system depends on the wellbeing of professional providers. [84] [85] [86] Supportive leadership is an important factor towards workplace wellbeing, and thus the perceived professional support is acknowledged. 87 Solutions for managing or mitigating the burnout are neither easy nor quick. 88 Although it has been accepted as exacerbating the stress and individuals' inability to recover, there are difficulties in defining, diagnosing, and addressing its underlying structural causes. 88, 89 To sum up, we explored and evaluated the relationship between healthcare workers' vulnerability (with a highlight on gender differences, professional roles and responsibilities) and resilience factors, when confronted with stress caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of support in the professional environment was associated with higher anxiety and stress, less resilience and empathy, and higher burnout scores. A triad-type relationship between professional support, burnout-depersonalization, and lack of empathy was observed and analyzed through a mediation mechanism. The missing professional support for medical staff might generate major vulnerabilities in the relationship between healthcare workers and their patients, and unfavorable mid-and long-term consequences on the quality of healthcare services. The main limitation of this study was that a crosssectional design cannot prove causality. However, the analytic procedure employed for testing and measuring the mediation role of burnout allowed us to bring evidence toward designing future longitudinal/interventional studies. Other limitations were generated by the assumptions for employing multiple regression to estimate the mediation model: (a) the dependent variable does not cause the mediator; (b) there is no measurement error in the mediator. The first assumption was met, but the self-reported burnout scores might entail unavoidable measurement errors, with an attenuation effect on the size of association measures and subsequent overestimation bias of the independent variable (up to the extent that it would cause the mediator). Consequently, as a psychological variable, it would tend to produce an underestimate of the mediator's effect and even overlook successful mediators. A possible solution might be to test the linkages by employing structural modeling, but this approach would go beyond the scope of this applied research. Burnout was not actually proved as a necessary condition for the effect of professional support to occur on empathy; on the other hand, the small and non-significant direct effect (although not zero) suggests a robust and generalizable mediation model, in spite of the above mentioned limitations.  Additional caveats were generated by the auto-selection of individuals participating in the survey (the respondents might have been more enthusiastic or willing to engage in their work, and thus might have had higher levels of resilience or empathy, compared to non-respondents). The potential misleading effect of the outliers on the scales' scorings was compensated by employing non-parametric statistical methods in data analysis. In addition to the inherent errors related to selfreporting, the coding of empathy and professional support as dichotomies is error-prone as well. However, many other recent studies employed similar coding strategies, since the number of measurements is inherently limited in most study designs. Data sets are not publicly available but de-identified data may be provided upon request.@story_separate@We brought evidence towards a mediation role of burnout in the relationship between the organizational support and the empathy among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. This viewpoint is a systemic one, offering perspectives over several factors involved. The circularity of the approach confers indirect suggestions as to how interventions may be designed. Health policies would seek workable solutions to address modifiable factors to alleviate the burnout and implement the lessons beyond the current pandemic, and to embody compassionate and patient-centered organizational culture. We suggest that implementing prevention programs aimed at relieving the pressure on healthcare personnel outside the range of the received training or confidence in their own professionalism would avoid the burnout and its toll of empathy, thus evading subsequent degradation of medical services' quality. Such programs might include mental health screening for identifying early signs of burnout, psychological support and comprehensive educational interventions for mid-career professionals, residents, and medical students.","PURPOSE: The year 2020 was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, massively disruptive at the general population level and for healthcare systems. We aimed to evaluate the psychological distress associated with work-related experiences among medical professionals and supporting staff during the pandemic outbreak. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between April and May 2020, employing a self-administered on-line questionnaire that included the collection of socio-demographic and professional status information, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and a subscale of the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) for empathy. A total of 364 professionals of the county-coordinated area responded. Descriptive statistics summarized the findings and a mediation model was analyzed, applying the causal step strategy. The specific direct and causal mediation effects were estimated with the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap sampling method. RESULTS: Anxiety, burnout, stress, resilience, and empathy proved to be significantly associated with both the professional category (ie, consultant, specialty doctor, trainee doctor, senior nurse, trainee nurse or other) and the perceived professional support (the nonparametric multivariate permutation test resulted in p=0.048 and p<0.001, respectively). When controlling for the marital and professional status, the female gender had an OR=2.26, 95% CI (1.21; 4.22) toward a high level of empathy compared to males. The causal mediation effect of the perceived lack of professional support on empathy through burnout-depersonalization was highly significant (p<0.001) with an average of 0.0599, 95% CI (0.0238; 0.10), while the direct effect was non-significant (p=0.536) with an average of 0.0295, 95% CI (−0.0774; 0.15). CONCLUSION: We highlighted the impact of the lack of professional support on healthcare workers’ empathy through burnout-depersonalization in a context of a high workload, time pressure, job stress beyond previous training, and inherently limited organizational support, which are potentially modifiable factors in the mid-term."
"Infectious diseases are emerging or re-emerging almost every year. They are a result of the presence and growth of pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, and/or fungi, in the host organism, which can propagate between people. The type and extent of damage inflicted by these microbial agents, which is intimately related to the production and liberation of toxins that affect the regular tasks of each organ/system, could lead to the appearance of specific clinical symptoms [1, 2] . Since the beginning of the 20th century, infectious diseases have been classified as the primary cause of death worldwide. Indeed, emerging infectious diseases are rising [2, 3] . This trend is expected to continue, as newly evolved strains of pathogens emerge (multiresistant) and enter the human population without a proper fighting response being available (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus). The increase in the global population and its aging, the climate changes, and the facility of travel between countries have all favored the emergence, evolution, and spread of these new pathogens [4] . Projection patterns of the evolution of this crisis have highlighted bacteria and viruses as the most prevalent and concerning group of pathogens: the first due to their increasing resistance to antibiotics and the second due to their high capacity to adapt to new hosts. Skin infections are amongst the most common infectious diseases, ranked as the fourth leading cause of human illnesses [5] . Both bacteria and viruses are responsible for many serious, difficult to treat skin conditions. Fungi are also highly prevalent in skin diseases. Skin infections present considerable threats to a person's health, psychological wellbeing, capacity to operate, and social involvement. In 2013, the socioeconomic burden associated with skin diseases was estimated at USD 75 billion and USD 11 billion for direct (healthcare expenses) and indirect (professional constraints) costs, respectively, in the USA [6] . As the population ages, the amount of people affected by skin conditions rises proportionally. Tears in the skin integrity, which become more frequent with age as the tissue loses its inherent elasticity and flexibility, are frequently inoculated by pathogens that invade the dermis, causing skin infections. In many situations, the skin microbiota and the antimicrobial factors produced by the various cell layers forming this tissue are capable of fighting infections and preventing serious illnesses from evolving [7] . However, as the pathogens evolve and mutate and the population ages, our inherent immune defenses become compromised, being unable to effectively respond in a timely manner to their action. Antimicrobial agents based on biological cues are, in many instances, essential to overcome the shortcomings of our immune system and assist in the treatment of infectious diseases [8] . Indeed, there are many antimicrobial biomolecules currently available to fight pathogenic microorganisms that affect the skin. Antibiotics, due to their effectiveness and accessibility, are among the most prevalent biomolecules to be used in treatments of infectious diseases. They target the physiology or the biochemistry of the microorganism, inhibiting their replication or inactivating specific functions, ultimately leading to their death. Yet, due to the appearance and propagation of resistant microbial cells, therapies for skin infections have become more challenging in the last twenty years [8, 9] . New biomolecules that impart specific cell functions or leave a smaller environmental footprint are now raising more attention [10] . In the present work, an overview of the skin inherent mechanisms of action against microbial cells and the alternative biomolecules that may be used to assist in this action or surpass its limitations is presented. A complete description of the most prevalent skin infectious disease traits and the possible biomolecules that can be or are already being applied to treat such conditions is also provided, where special emphasis is placed on natural-origin biomolecules. Generally, this publication reviews the most recent research that explores the use of conventional or recently emerging biomolecules to treat skin infections.@story_separate@The skin is humans' largest and most exposed organ, offering protection against the loss of endogenous compounds and external stimuli, including microbial invasion ( Figure 1 ). It forms 8% of the body weight and is subdivided into three major layers, the epidermis which is the most superficial layer, the dermis located beneath the epidermis and made mostly of connective tissues, and the hypodermis, which is a deeper, subcutaneous tissue made from connective and adipose tissues [7, 11, 12] . The protective features of the skin vary across its regions and the age of the person, often generating conditions conducive for microbial growth in localized microenvironments or exhibiting properties that impart a direct antimicrobial protection. Microorganisms present along the skin are one of the largest communities of microbes in humans. Indeed, the cutaneous microbiota contains bacteria, fungi, and viral communities. These resident microbial species defend the host from pathogenic organisms by producing antimicrobial factors or stimulating cells to secret antimicrobial cues that prevent the growth and proliferation of pathogens [14, 15] . For instance, the skin-resident coagulase-negative Staphylococci bacteria can produce toxins such as phenol-soluble modulins that attack more harmful strains of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Further, they can work in symbiosis with the skin antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to inhibit pathogen colonization [7] . The epidermis operates as the first line of protection against microorganisms. It is formed mostly of keratinocytes, whose phenotype and functions differ along the stratified epidermis, the stratum corneum, the stratum granulosum, the stratum spinosum, and the stratum basale. These keratinocytes express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that trigger pathways that maintain the host-microbial homeostasis [16] . These stratums offer resistance against the penetration of most microbes by engaging with AMPs to fortify the integrity of the skin barrier. Indeed, the epidermis is formed mostly of AMPs and lipids, both exhibiting antimicrobial functions. AMPs are small peptide molecules that can both kill or inhibit The protective features of the skin vary across its regions and the age of the person, often generating conditions conducive for microbial growth in localized microenvironments or exhibiting properties that impart a direct antimicrobial protection. Microorganisms present along the skin are one of the largest communities of microbes in humans. Indeed, the cutaneous microbiota contains bacteria, fungi, and viral communities.

These stratums offer resistance against the penetration of most microbes by engaging with AMPs to fortify the integrity of the skin barrier. Indeed, the epidermis is formed mostly of AMPs and lipids, both exhibiting antimicrobial functions. AMPs are small peptide molecules that can both kill or inhibit microbial responses, limiting their growth. Their secretion is dependent on the conditions of the skin (healthy or infected) [17] . Antimicrobial lipids, in their turn, are synthesized and transferred to the surface of the skin during cell differentiation, being capable of fighting Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and increasing the expres- At the dermis, fibroblasts produce collagen, elastin, and other extracellular species while still increasing the skin antimicrobial signals and, in this way, working as immunomodulatory cells [19] . The dermis fibroblasts produce cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)), growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1)), and metalloproteinases (MMP-1) that stimulate the adhesion and migration of immune cells, such as macrophages, mast cells, leukocytes, and dermal dendritic cells [7] . Even though the antimicrobial action of the dermis is not as important as that of the epidermis, the infiltration and recruitment of immune cells to fight microbial pathogens that occur in this layer remain vital. These cells provide additional antimicrobial defense by promoting the liberation of large amounts of cathelicidins, such as the AMP LL37 [20] , that not only fight microbial colonization but also stimulate keratinocyte proliferation and induction of angiogenesis. Indeed, in injured, infected portions of the skin, the dermal fibroblasts and the epidermal keratinocytes work in synergy to restore the skin barrier [19] . The hypodermis, also known as the subcutaneous layer, has a small but still very important part to play in protecting the skin against microbial infection. The adipose tissue of the subcutaneous layer can be subdivided into brown adipose tissue (BAT), white adipose tissue (WAT), and ""beige"" adipose tissue [21] . The WAT, which can be found close to hair follicles, altering in size as the hair grows, or underneath the dermal layer, is also capable of producing cathelicidin AMPs and expands in size for a quick proliferation of adipocyte precursors. A recent study reported a causal relationship between the expansion of adipose tissues and the hypodermis's ability to protect against pathogenic cells [7, 22] . This protective behavior inherent to all layers composing the skin relies on their cell components or immune cells to which they impart a specific function, by meticulously triggered pathways. Still, many pathogenic microbes can disrupt this specialized line of defense, acting quickly against the human body and causing serious skin infections. To overcome these shortcomings, antimicrobial biomolecules are frequently employed. Biomolecule is a loosely applied term to define biological materials derived from living organisms (animals, plants, etc.) that exert important tasks in specific biological phenomena. In infectious diseases, these biological cues are usually administered orally or immobilized/incorporated within delivery systems for a local or systemic distribution [23] . In skin infections, three major classes of biomolecules with antimicrobial potential have been identified: antibiotics, AMPs, and natural extracts. Antibiotics are considered the greatest clinical advance of the 20th century. They are defined as chemical substances of microbial or synthetic origin endowed with antimicrobial features that can treat infectious diseases. In order to be categorized as effective, antibiotics should target intact elements of the bacterial cell wall, should reach their target in sufficient amounts to elicit the desired effect, and should not undergo chemical alterations that may hinder their effectiveness [24] . Antibiotic action can be classified as bactericidal, killing bacteria, and/or bacteriostatic, preventing bacterial growth. Bactericidal antibiotics, such as glycopeptides, beta-lactams, or fluoroquinolones, are often preferred to bacteriostatic antibiotics in the treatment of skin disorders. These target the cell membrane of bacteria, the cell wall biosynthesis of enzymes and other substrates, protein synthesis, or bacterial nucleic acid replication, compromising the cell integrity and eventually leading to its death [25] . Their specific structure and metabolism enable them to act against pathogenic microbials with minimal side effects to mammalian cells [8] . Alterations in their performance may lead to bacterial resistance. This may occur in response to: target modifications through mutation, decreased bacteria cell permeability, reduced biomolecule influx or increased efflux, and degradation/deactivation of the antibiotic molecules by means of enzymatic hydrolysis or chemical action [26] . The overuse or misuse of these biomolecules has increased bacteria tolerance and the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Indeed, the spread of resistant bacteria has become a growing public health concern, which renders lifesaving drugs less effective. For that reason, alternative therapies based on AMPs or natural extracts are now gaining more impact in patient care. Still, many efforts continue to be devoted to the development of new and more effective drugs. Despite these drawbacks, antibiotics remain, to this day, the main source of antimicrobial agents to fight bacteria-derived skin infections. Newer, directed-spectrum antibiotics are, in fact, being design to circumvent these multidrug resistance mechanisms [8, 10] . AMPs are progressively gaining more focus as new therapies to treat skin infections. Indeed, one of their pivotal roles in the skin is to guarantee its innate immunity. Their significance in skin treatments became particularly noticeable when the release of cathelicidins during wound healing was uncovered and when the presence of β-defensins in psoriatic scales was determined ample. AMPs not only impart antimicrobial effects but are also involved in triggering immunological responses against microbial pathogens [27] . AMPs are oligopeptides formed of short sequences of amino acids. AMPs are lowmolecular weight biomolecules, cationic, and amphiphilic, which can be chemically synthesized or secreted by procaryotic and eukaryotic cells (e.g., human skin). To date, all identifiable AMPs are categorized in one of four categories, according to their secondary structure: β-sheet, α-helix, extended, and loop, with the first two configurations being the most common. They target the lipopolysaccharide layer of microorganisms, which is unique to them, hence expressing little effects against the low-anionic and cholesterol-rich human eukaryotic cells. Moreover, due to their quick killing effect, resistance by microorganisms is more difficult to cultivate. Depending on their target microbial agent, they can be classified as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, or antiparasitic. In all cases, AMPs act against the microbial cells by disrupting the membrane/wall/envelope integrity, inhibiting proteins', nucleic acids', or other important compounds' synthesis, or by permeabilizing the microorganism and interacting with certain intracellular targets ( Figure 2 ). One of the most important features of AMPs is their ability to act against microbial cells using a multi-hit strategy based on non-specific mechanisms of action, which tends to broaden their spectrum of antimicrobial action even against multi-resistant pathogens [8, 17, 28, 29] . significance in skin treatments became particularly noticeable when the release of cathelicidins during wound healing was uncovered and when the presence of β-defensins in psoriatic scales was determined ample. AMPs not only impart antimicrobial effects but are also involved in triggering immunological responses against microbial pathogens [27] . AMPs are oligopeptides formed of short sequences of amino acids. AMPs are lowmolecular weight biomolecules, cationic, and amphiphilic, which can be chemically synthesized or secreted by procaryotic and eukaryotic cells (e.g., human skin). To date, all identifiable AMPs are categorized in one of four categories, according to their secondary structure: β-sheet, α-helix, extended, and loop, with the first two configurations being the most common. They target the lipopolysaccharide layer of microorganisms, which is unique to them, hence expressing little effects against the low-anionic and cholesterol-rich human eukaryotic cells. Moreover, due to their quick killing effect, resistance by microorganisms is more difficult to cultivate. Depending on their target microbial agent, they can be classified as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, or antiparasitic. In all cases, AMPs act against the microbial cells by disrupting the membrane/wall/envelope integrity, inhibiting proteins', nucleic acids', or other important compounds' synthesis, or by permeabilizing the microorganism and interacting with certain intracellular targets ( Figure 2 ). One of the most important features of AMPs is their ability to act against microbial cells using a multi-hit strategy based on non-specific mechanisms of action, which tends to broaden their spectrum of antimicrobial action even against multi-resistant pathogens [8, 17, 28, 29] . Recent studies have reported evidence of resistance mechanisms by pathogens against naturally occurring skin AMPs. To overcome this obstacle, synthetic peptides are being engineered. Research has shown that even very structurally similar peptides, synthesized based on known natural structures, can impart completely different mechanisms of action and even increase their range of targeted microbials. Another option has been to combine different origin biomolecules, such as antibiotics with AMPs or AMPs with herbal derivatives, to fight the enhanced microbial action of these resistant pathogens [31] . A substantial percentage of extracts collected from plants are claimed to display beneficial results in infection control. To date, more than 12,000 secondary plant metabolites have been isolated and identified, a number that represents less than 10% of the total possibilities still available and to be discovered. These secondary metabolites act as antioxidants, free radical-scavenging actuators, UV light absorbents, or protectors against potential environment-derived attackers, namely, microorganisms. The palette of secondary metabolites can be subdivided according to the chemical structure and synthetic pathways of their active compounds. The major classes encompass ( Figure 3 ): (1) phenolics, whose structural motif is the phenol molecule, and which are produced by plants in response to bacterial and fungal attacks against which they can generate non-specific interactions with proteins or inhibit enzyme actions; (2) terpenes, whose structure includes one or more five-carbon isoprene units, and which display toxicity that varies from lethal to completely comestible depending on their ecological roles and may act against microbial pathogens by disrupting their membrane through lipophilic substances; and (3) alkaloids, which are heterocyclic nitrogen complexes able to intercalate with microbial pathogens' DNA, compromising their normal functions [8, 32] . Within the terpenes class, it is possible to find a very important category of plant extracts that has been gaining considerable attention, namely, essential oils (EOs). These are aromatic, volatile substances that can impart inhibitory or biocidal effects against the replication of many microbial cells. EOs can permeate the cell membrane, reducing the presence of important intracellular components by raising the local acidity, which blocks the production of ATP and destroys genetic material [33] . Even though their toxicity to human cells has been a major limitation to their generalized application in medicine, with allergic reactions and skin irritation being the most recurrent side effects, recent studies in which nano-and micro-delivery vehicles have been employed or the EOs proportion has been reduced in combination with other antimicrobial substances have been very promising, suggesting an optimistic future for EOs-containing strategies to treat skin problems [10] . ways of their active compounds.

Skin infections can affect the skin layers and the inherent connective tissues. From the neonate to the elderly, all of the human population can be affected by a wide spectrum of skin diseases. In fact, when reaching 70 years old, nearly 70% of people will have had a minimum of one skin condition in their life [35] . Bacteria, viruses, and fungi are amongst the microbial pathogens responsible for the most frequent skin infections. In this section, special attention will be placed on those dermatological illnesses that may benefit from the action of conventional and/or new biomolecules in their treatments, namely, antibiotics, AMPs, and natural extracts. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a very frequent inflammatory disorder, highly pruritic, and related to cutaneous hyper-reactivity to triggers present in the environment. It is identifiable by its poorly delineated erythema with edema, presence of vesicles, and, in acute states, chronic weeping and skin thickening. There has been much debate as to whether AD is an allergen-induced disease, or an inflammatory skin disorder found in combination with respiratory conditions. Regardless, investigations have demonstrated that AD is characterized by an intricate etiology, with the stimulation of various immunologic and inflammatory pathways. The prevalence of this condition is superior in children, with 10-20% of children being affected compared to only 1-3% of adults [36] . Due to the industrial revolution of the last three decades and the increased worldwide levels of pollution, these rates have been continuously increasing, with effective treatments becoming highly demanded [37] . AD is typified by dry skin and enhanced transepidermal loss of water. In AD, ceramides, which are lipids present in the skin layers responsible for conserving the molecules of water, are in deficit. Thus, the skin becomes more susceptible to irritants, conditioning epidermal differentiation and prompting inflammatory responses. Allergens may also trigger scratching of the skin which initiates the inflammatory cascade by releasing proinflammatory cytokines from atopic keratinocytes [38] . In most patients with AD, as the skin barrier becomes compromised, infections occur. S. aureus is the most prevalent microorganism. It tends to aggravate AD conditions by producing toxins known as superantigens that activate T cells and macrophages as the patients try to secret immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, specific against these molecules. They also induce corticosteroid resistance, raising the severity of the patient's condition. As S. aureus binds to the inflamed skin, its innate response becomes compromised as this bacterium prevents the skin components from producing AMPs necessary to protect the host from bacteria, fungi, and virus colonization. For that reason, people suffering from AD have an enhanced tendency to develop infections spread by herpes simplex or vaccinia viruses, for instance [36, 39, 40] . The conventional treatments for AD-related infections rely on the topical administration of antibiotics. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are among the most common. However, recent reports have suggested that bacteria are starting to develop resistance. Alternatively, formulations that combine gentamycin with corticosteroids have become more popular in AD treatments. Another option is to employ antiseptics, such as triclosan or chlorhexidine, in the form of emollients, which can significantly reduce colonization by S. aureus without significant risks of skin sensitization. In cases where infection is caused not only by S. aureus but also by S. pyogenes, systemic antimicrobials are preferable. Here, amoxicillin/clavulanate or clindamycin antibiotics may be administered for a period of 3 to 7 days, even though gastrointestinal discomfort may occur. For longer periods, courses of sulfamethoxazole/trimethroprin are recommended to prevent the development of microbial resistance [41] . In recent years, antibody-or cytokine-directed therapies have been uncovered with successful outcomes in preventing T cell activation or the over-secretion of cytokines and other mediators involved in AD. For instance, omalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody selectively directed against circulating IgE, may block circulating IgE's interaction with the receptors of the basophils and the mast cells' membrane, inhibiting their activity, degranulation, and the liberation of different mediators responsible for AD [42] . Even though these inhibitor-based therapies are very sought after, their intervention against infection agents is considered minimal. Indeed, in many cases, additional or secondary therapies are recommended. Herbal preparations are often used. Aloe vera, for instance, has shown significant effects on AD skin lesions by reducing IL-5 and IL-10 levels while fighting the presence of bacteria and fungi [43] . Cannabis sativa is also employed to treat itchiness and relieve pain symptoms in AD. Using the oil from the seeds of this plant, it is possible to strengthen the skin, increasing its resistance to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections [44] . German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) has been used for centuries to treat skin inflammations, including dermatitis. Topical chamomile ointments have even been compared to hydrocortisone-containing formulations for their ability to reduce the affected surface area or by improving sodium lauryl sulfate-induced contact dermatitis. Their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory performance has been attributed to the presence of an essential blue oil in their composition, which is formed of sesquiterpene alcohol, α-bisabolol, chamazulene, and flavonoids [45] . Tannin agents derived from black tea or oak bark have also been suggested as effective in relieving acute weeping, or in soothing inflammation and skin pruritus. They act by coagulating the protein regions in the cell surface and the exudates, thus reducing absorbency and secretion, and by acting against pathogenic microbials, reducing infection [46] . Flaws in the AMPs present in the skin barrier may contribute to the AD pathogenesis. Indeed, LL37, hBD-2, and hBD-3 AMPs are frequently downregulated in lesions caused by AD. In many instances, this reduced AMP expression is even triggered by the use of corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors applied topically [47] . To overcome such problems, many therapeutics targeting the skin microbiome and the inherent AMP expression have been formulated with the goal of restoring skin homeostasis and, thus, overturning AD symptoms. Smits et al. suggested the use of coal tar to activate the receptor aryl hydrocarbon and, in this way, induce the secretion of AMPs derived from keratinocytes. Here, as coal tar reduced the abundance of S. aureus and restored the microbiota composition to healthier rates, the AMP levels in AD skin were also elevated, rendering the affected area less prone to infection and inflammation [48] . Psoriasis is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory skin condition in which localized lesions, demarcated erythematous, and silver scaly plaques are often observed on the knees, elbows, trunk, and scalp. It is characterized by an abnormal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, increased dermal blood vessel formation with enhanced permeability of wide-caliber vessels, and dermis invasion by several immune cells which increase the inflammation mediated by cytokines, including tumor TNFα, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and various ILs [49] . The prevalence of this skin infectious disease has been rising over time, now affecting 2-3% of the global population, with 0.5-11.4% being adults and 0-1.4% being children [50] . In patients with psoriasis, the life cycle of the skin reduces from 30 to 1.5-3.0 days, which facilitates the appearance of localized lesions [51] . Dry, cracked skin and irritation are also very common. Psoriatic areas may vary in size from a few spots of dandruff-like scaling to large outbreaks that spread significantly across the body. Various forms of psoriasis have been identified: (1) plaque, the most frequent, characterized by red skin patches and silvery scales that predominate on the elbows, the lower back, the knees, or the scalp; (2) nail, which affects fingernails and toenails, resulting in pitting, atypical nail development, and discoloration; (3) guttate, which is primarily detected in children and young adults and is triggered by bacterial infections; (4) inverse, which causes the appearance of smooth red skin patches on intimate regions (e.g., groin, breasts, or buttocks) and may be aggravated with the friction and sweat sensed on these areas; (5) pustular, which is more rare and is characterized by the appearance of pus-filled lesions; (6) erythrodermic, the least common, which affects the entire body of the patient, covering it with a red, peeling rash; and (7) arthritis, which affects the patient's joints and may cause stiffness or progressive joint damage [52] . Many microorganisms have been associated with the initiation and/or worsening of psoriasis, regardless of the type, including bacteria (S. pyogenes, S. aureus), fungi (Malassezia, Candida albicans), and viruses (papillomaviruses, retroviruses, endogenous retroviruses) [53] . The most significant effect has been that of the bacterium S. pyogenes, evidenced in both acute and chronic psoriatic patients. This pathogen is mostly associated with the guttate form of psoriasis. Here, superantigens or T cell-activating toxins generated by this bacterium can bind to the T cell receptors, inducing the manifestation of a skin homing receptor, the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen, which may trigger an autoimmune reaction on the skin [54] . Near 60% of psoriatic patients present lesions colonized by S. aureus. The presence of toxin-positive S. aureus on patients' skin was found to have a significant impact on the dimensions of the affected area and the severity of the disorder [55] . In the case of fungi, Malassezia tends to occupy the outermost regions of the stratum corneum rich in sebaceous glands, frequently being found associated with lesions present on the chest, back, and scalp. They act by upregulating keratinocyte expression, which then results in a hyperproliferation and cell migration of the epidermis [52, 56] . The mechanism by which C. albicans exacerbates psoriasis is not yet known. However, a correlation with an increased number of this pathogenic yeast's presence in feces of psoriasis patients has been established. It is suspected that C. albicans may produce superantigens just like S. pyogenes or S. aureus, stimulating T cell activation and, thus, leading to an increased severity of the psoriatic lesions [52] . Currently, psoriasis does not have a cure. Yet, many strategies have been designed to try and relieve the patient symptoms and prevent the evolution of psoriasis-related signs. Conventional topical medications incorporate corticosteroids, vitamin D3, retinoids, calcineurin inhibitors, coal tar, dithranol, and emollients, while systemic therapies frequently resort to immunomodulators (cyclosporine) and retinoids (acitretin). Corticosteroids are considered the gold standard for psoriasis treatment. Once applied, corticosteroids can bind to the glucocorticoid receptors in the cells' cytoplasm, increasing the formation of lipocortin, which is responsible for inhibiting the phospholipase A2 activity and the formation of IL-1. These actions wield anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant, anti-proliferative, and anti-mitogenic impacts. However, they may also affect the epidermis, rendering the skin photosensitive, delaying wound healing, and causing ulceration or even atrophy of the affected areas [57] . To prevent such events, emollients and moisturizers, which exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, prevent microbial invasion, and reduce transepidermal water loss, may be used as adjuvant actuators. The use of these antibiotics in psoriasis has been prompted mostly by the presence of streptococci bacteria in different forms of the disease. They act against the bacteria by preventing the colonization of pathogens along the lesions or by targeting specific factors associated with their infectious potential. Even though they remain a highly effective choice, they may also hinder skin healing or even exacerbate the condition (Table 1 ) [58] . In recent years, biologics, which are biomolecules that target the immune or genetic mediators in a pathophysiologic event, have been used to target T cells or block the action of TNFα and IL actuators and, in this way, reduce the inflammatory response in psoriasis. The USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) endorsed the first biologics in 2003, namely, alefacept and efalizumab, but since then, many more have progressed successfully through clinical trials and have reached the market. These biomolecules have been considered more effective than corticosteroids as they suppress the activated local immune response. However, their long-term use may increase the risk of uncontrolled infections [51, 59] . Recent research has demonstrated that, by combining these biologics with metabolites present in vitamins, it is, indeed, possible to overcome such problems. For instance, the use of IL-17 inhibitors, which modify the cytokine pathways, may also increase the risk of fungal infections caused by Candida spp. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin involved in a variety of metabolic and physiologic activities but also works as a host-protective effector against bacterial, viral, and yeast infections. Since IL-17 is engaged in the inflammatory reaction responsible for triggering and sustaining psoriatic disease, and knowing that TH17 cells specific to C. albicans produce IL-17, combinations of inhibitors of this cytokine with antimicrobial molecules are seen as a promising solution [60] . For many years, natural extracts have been used to treat infected skin lesions in psoriasis, mostly as a complementary therapy. Capsaicin (Capsicum frutescens) was determined to hamper phorbol ester-stimulated initiation of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, which then resulted in a significant decrease in scaling and erythema in moderate to severe psoriasis patients [61] . Curcumin behaves similarly, being capable of suppressing the phosphorylase kinase activity and even imparting antimicrobial and antioxidant effects onto the affected areas. In the form of nano-emulsions or while microencapsulated, its action is even more effective, reducing the yellow staining of the skin derived from its topical administration [62] . EOs can provide soothing effects to the affected areas of the skin and even effectively irradiate pathogens. Tea tree oil (TTO), rose geranium oil, and lavender oil are all endowed with anti-inflammatory features as well as antibacterial and antifungal properties. Marine sponges, such as Dysidea avara, are also known to effectively inhibit inflammatory biomarkers, such as TNFα, and to suppress the action of keratinocytes. Most importantly, they are effective antiviral biomolecules and may display moderate antibacterial activities [63] . Herpes simplex viruses type 1 and type 2 (HSV1 and HSV2) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) are neurotropic pathogenic viruses found in humans. Both HSV and VZV are affiliated to the herpesviridae DNA viruses. The first is frequently detected in the labial skin of the mouth (HSV1) or genitalia (HSV2), and the second is characterized by cutaneous eruptions along the skin filled with pus that tend to rupture and scab before healing. HSV1 is mostly transmitted by oral-oral contact but may also be transmitted by oral-genital contact. Oral herpes infection is mostly asymptomatic. However, those that exhibit symptoms tend to experience painful blisters or open sores in or around the mouth. HSV2 is mostly transmitted during sex, through genital contact. As with oral herpes, people affected by HSV2 are often asymptomatic, and those exhibiting symptoms reveal the presence of blisters or open sores around the genitals or anal region. Both HSV and VZV share specific identifiable traits that influence their infective sequence in the body: they start by acting on the mucocutaneous regions, which work as an entryway portal of infection, and then may be transported towards the dorsal root ganglia, where they are kept in a latent form until the virus is activated. Even though primary infection occurs in the first twenty or thirty years of a person life's, revival of the virus may still take place in advanced ages [64, 65] . Table 1 . Antibiotics most frequently employed to treat psoriasis, their targeted bacteria, mechanisms of action, and effects on the condition (adapted from [58] ). (CC BY 4.0 license). Bacterial Target Antivirals such as acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are very effective in treating HSV. They act by preventing viral replication by means of inhibiting DNA polymerase action in infected cells. The application of corticosteroids as secondary or additional therapies remains contentious; however, when HSV is associated with encephalitis conditions, a high dose of steroids may be recommended [64] . Melissa officinalis oils presented to HSV1 lesioned areas in the form of balms have been shown to significantly act on patients by reducing the size of the ulcerations and the healing time. Here, tannin and polyphenols have been indicated as responsible for the antiviral effects of these balms [66] . These same antivirals may also be used to treat or prevent HSV2. However, a prophylactic and corrective anti-HSV2 vaccine is usually recommended. VZV is mostly a disorder of older people, and its appearance may be triggered by disorders such as diabetes mellitus, spinal anesthesia, malignancies, and conditions associ-ated with immune suppression (e.g., AIDS) [64] . The therapeutic approach is similar to HSV, resorting mainly to the antivirals acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir, the last two being preferrable due to their superior pharmacokinetic reports and easier dosing routines. Alternatively, the antiviral drugs brivudine and foscarnet may also be employed [67] . The natural extracts Capiscum frutescens and hibiscus have been reported to reduce localized pain generated by ulcers, while glycyrrhizin-derived products were reported to hinder the in vitro propagation of varicella zoster [68, 69] . At the moment, no in vivo studies have been conducted using these natural components. Acne vulgaris is a very frequent skin condition. It often appears in oily regions of the body, namely, the face, back, and trunk. Acne vulgaris is considered an inflammatory disease of pilosebaceous follicles, affecting over 85% of the youngster population. It is caused by a heightened sebum formation, hypercornification of the pilosebaceous duct, abnormal behavior of the microbial skin flora with colonization of the duct with Cutibacterium acnes, and an irregular inflammatory response. Even though acne is not considered an infectious disease per say, four key microorganisms can be isolated from the skin of patients suffering from this disorder, namely, C. acne, Cutibacterium granulosum, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Malasezia furfur. These are normal skin commensals that tend to proliferate very quickly during puberty, very often being responsible for the development of acne. Indeed, the hypercolonization of the sebaceous follicle by C. acnes has been known to increase acne-related inflammation by inducing immunological reactions, including the upregulation of cytokine expression by its extracellular biproducts, the sebum free fatty acids metabolized by the triglycerides. Contrary to the other microbials, S. epidermidis is regularly engaged in superficial infections within the sebaceous unit [70] [71] [72] . For many years, topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and topical/systemic antibiotics have been used to treat this condition. Lymecycline, erythromycin, and oxytetracycline are among the most common antibiotic strategies [73] . However, C. acnes has been revealing increased resistance to these standard therapies. It is not yet clear if the resistance to the action of the antibiotics is indeed related to the presence of this microbial cell or the combination of various pathogens with endogenous unregulated factors. There have been reports showing variations in response to antibiotics from C. acnes colonies within the same culture. Differences between C. acnes strains with the ability to form biofilms resistant to antimicrobials have also been described. For instance, beta-lactam antibiotics are ineffective against acne, but quite effective against in vitro cultures of C. acnes [74] . As in acne vulgaris, innate AMPs are upregulated in keratinocytes and sebocytes, which may exacerbate the inflammatory response, and alternative treatments resorting to AMPs have become excellent candidates to overcome the limitations faced by antibiotic-based therapies. AMPs can inhibit the growth of C. acnes while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion. The ability of peptides derived from granulysin to decrease the presence of acne in the body, by displaying bactericidal and anti-inflammatory effects against C. acnes, has proven just that [75] . Further, the cecropin A-magainin 2 hybrid analog P5 AMP can bind to lipoteichoic acid, lowering C. acnes-triggered TLR2 upregulation in keratinocytes and inhibiting microbial growth [76] . Analogous findings were achieved with melittin peptides [77] . Designed peptides which are chemically synthesized are another option to modulate immune responses and impart antibiotic properties against pathogens. Woodburn et al. uncovered five new AMP sequences with bactericidal effectiveness against C. acnes commercial strains and clinical isolates. Their specificity for eliminating multidrug-resistant C. acnes over mammalian cells was also evidenced. Moreover, the topical administration of the most successful designed AMP was seen to eliminate infection [78] . Oxidative stress is another biproduct of the sebum produced from damaged follicular walls of sebaceous glands in acne. This is initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for the skin irritation associated with acne infection. As most synthetic antioxidant compounds tend to aggravate this situation, acting on the skin microbiota, plant-derived molecules endowed with antimicrobial features have become an important alternative. Vora et al. reported the potentiality of methanolic extracts of Rosmarinus officinalis, Acacia nilotica, and Azadirachta indica to fight infections caused by C. acnes while highlighting their antioxidant mechanisms [79] . Resveratrol, extracted from grape seeds, has been incorporated in a carboxymethylcellulose-based gel to serve as a mask with equal purposes [80] . Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, from the Myrtaceae family, contains various phytochemical compounds (ellagitannins, stilbenes, anthocyanins, flavonols, and phenolic acids) with potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. Recent reports have shown that this natural extract possesses microbiota-regulating agents, which reduce retentional and inflammatory acne lesions while decreasing the abundance of C. acnes bacteria [81] . Similar observations were made with TTO and rosemary EOs. Data reported bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of these two natural compounds against antibiotic-resistant acne clinical isolates [82] . The synergistic effect between EOs has also been examined by Bunrathep et al., who reported an optimal ratio concentration between citronella, lemongrass, and patchouli EOs for an effective antibacterial action against C. acnes and S. epidermidis [83] . Tinea is the name of a group of superficial skin infections caused by fungi, namely, by dermatophytes (filamentous fungi). Depending on the affected region, different designations may be employed: tinea corporis, which affects the trunk, neck, arms, and legs; tinea cruris, which involves the groin region; tinea pedis, commonly found on the feet; tinea faciei, found on the face; tinea capitis, frequently found on the scalp; and tinea manuum, which can be detected in the hands. Regardless of the type, the most common dermatophytes acting to cause infection belong to the genera Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Microsporum and have been classified based on their spread mechanism in anthropophilic (human), zoophilic (animal), and geophilic (soil) environments [84, 85] . Dermatophytes are capable of digesting keratinized tissues into oligopeptides or amino acids by proteases, serine-subtilisins, and fungolysin. They also reveal potent immunogenic actions by impairing the functions of Th17 cells and reducing secretion of IL-17 and IL-22, thus rendering infections more persistent. In microenvironments of the body characterized by excessive heat, alkaline pH, maceration, or a high relative humidity, proliferation of these pathogens increases significantly [86] . Most treatments for dermatophyte-induced infections resort to topical and oral antifungal preparations. The most employed topical antifungals are based on clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, naftifine, and terbinafine formulations. Oral therapies are required in more widespread infections in which topical treatments are infective and resort to terbinafine, itraconazole, fluconazole, or griseofulvin courses [85] . Yet, as topical mediations tend to present superior pharmacokinetics, combinations of topical and oral therapies have been highlighted as preferrable in imparting better microbial clearance. Shah et al. proposed the combination of terbinafine, a drug responsible for inhibiting the enzyme squalene epoxidase and, consequently, ergosterol synthesis, with ciclopirox olamine, a topical hydroxypyridone derivative which acts through the chelation of polyvalent metal cations, inhibiting metal-dependent enzymes. Their combination was seen to be very effective against tinea corporis and tinea cruris infections, without conveying detectable side effects to the patients [87] . AMPs are not as common as antifungals in the fight against dermatophyte-derived infections. However, there have already been reports on the effective use of psoriasin, an AMP isolated from psoriatic lesions, against Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, and Epidermophyton floccosum fungi. This compound is capable of interfering with zinc homeostasis, whose sequestration could result in an important antimicrobial mechanism [88] . Synthetic AMPs have also been uncovered. Lima et al. reported the synthesis of six synthetic AMPs with capability to either be used as models for novel antidermatophytic drugs or as complementary therapies for pre-existing ones. It was seen that the six AMPs were capable of reducing the growth of T. mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum fungi by up to 95%, by causing severe damage to their hyphal morphology, namely, by disturbing the cell wall, inducing content leakage and consequent cell lysis. Most importantly, these AMPs were far more effective than the conventional antifungals griseofulvin and itraconazole [89] . Alternative strategies by means of plant extracts have also been used in successful topical therapies. Sixty-five single EOs and twenty-one blends have been examined for their mechanisms of action against dermatophytes. From those, cassia, cilantro, cinnamon, thyme, and oregano EOs were found to be the most effective when used individually, while synergistic performances were observed when combining oregano, cilantro, cassia, or cinnamon, and with rosa and cassia formulations [90] . Macrocarpal C, extracted from the leaves of Eucalyptus globulus Labill, has shown a significant effect against T. mentagrophytes and T. rubrum fungi [91] . The crude leaf extract of Tetradenia riparia was examined against three clinical isolates of dermatophytes, T. tonsurans, T. mentagrophyte, and M. audouinii, revealing significant antidermatophytic activity [92] . Similar effects were obtained with calyx leaves of Hibiscussabdariffa L. when examined against the same pathogens, demonstrating great inhibitory performance against skin isolates due to their alkaloid, tannin, kalekoside, and phenol components [93] . From a microbial viewpoint, the main purpose of integral, undamaged skin is to avoid the incursion and colonization of underlying tissues. However, the exposure of the subcutaneous layers of the skin following loss of integrity may provide conditions conducive to microorganisms' growth. In acute wounds, the presence of microbial cells is not significant, with the healing cascade being capable of progressing without constraints. In chronic wounds, however, the presence of polymicrobial and/or resistant infection agents associated with a persistent inflammatory state frequently demands complementary antimicrobial therapies. Often disguised as a comorbidity condition, chronic wounds have been classified as a silent epidemic that affects a large fraction of the world population, with significant economic costs associated [12, 17, 20] . Similarly, burn wounds represent a susceptible site for opportunistic pathogens' colonization. Indeed, it is estimated that most registered deaths following burn injuries are correlated with infections rather than osmotic shock or hypovolemia. As microorganisms bind to these wounds, they start penetrating the burn eschar, quickly invading viable subeschar tissue and rendering it infected [94] . Non-healing wounds such as chronic or large-area burns may impair the physiological functions of the skin and spark morbidity or mortality risks. A major advance in treating these infected wounds has been the understanding that the mere presence of microorganisms is less important than their growth rate. Here, S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria have been identified as the most recurrent pathogens. S. aureus is typically located in the skin superficial layers, while P. aeruginosa is spotted in the innermost regions of the wound bed [95, 96] . By controlling infection, antimicrobial agents reduce the tendency for conversion of partial thickness wounds into full thickness wounds. Topical antimicrobial agents based on silver compounds, such as silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, mafenide acetate, or nanocrystalline silver, are frequently employed to prevent the spread of bacteria and even fungi (e.g., C. albicans) in infected wounds. The silver inhibitory effect results from its powerful interaction with the thiol radicals found in the respiratory enzymes of the microbial cells [97] . Mupirocin, an antibiotic produced from the fermentation process of Pseudomonas fluorescens, has also been highlighted as a powerful inhibitory effector against Gram-positive skin flora bacteria, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci and S. aureus, including MRSA [98] . Nystatin, an antibiotic produced from Streptomyces noursei, is considered a potent antifungal agent, whose action arises from its connection to the cell membrane sterols of fungi, imparting significant effects on wounds colonized by C. albicans [99] . Antiseptic agents such as povidone, cadexomer iodine, chlorhexidine, polyhexamethyl biguanide, and honey have also been applied to treat chronic wounds both to reduce inflammation and/or fight infections [17] . The healing significance of natural AMPs in wounds has been extensively analyzed [96] . Yet, in infection-directed therapies, only those AMPs that exhibit reduced cytotoxicity, great stability in microbial-colonized environments, and a broad antimicrobial spectrum of action can be used. The natural-origin peptide LL37 has shown significant effects against S. aureus and S. epidermidis bacteria, above conventional antibiotics (e.g., vancomycin), while functionalized onto poly(vinyl alcohol)/cellulose acetate dressings [20] . The novispirin G10 peptide revealed a quick action against P. aeruginosa on partial thickness burns before being inactivated by proteases [100] . In its turn, PXL150 demonstrated powerful antimicrobial actions by altering the potential of the S. aureus membrane and quickly eliminating P. aeruginosa bacteria [101] . Dual AMP combinations have also been attempted with pexiganan and nisin peptides. Gomes et al. reported their symbiotic effect against co-cultures of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa clinical strains and disclosed the need for smaller AMP concentrations, when in blends, to obtain effective outcomes [102] . Natural extracts have been considered, for years, as important players in the treatment of infected wounds [103] . Aloe vera is perhaps one of the most used as it decreases burning, itching, and scarring in many skin infectious diseases. Salicylic acid present in its composition is known to display analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by hindering prostaglandin production. This effect may be a result of the immunomodulatory assets of the gel polysaccharides present, namely, the acetylated mannans. Aloe vera also displays significant bactericidal and fungicidal effects [104] . Resveratrol, commonly found in grape seeds, and a silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) agonist, has been known to improve endothelial functions and to possess a strong proangiogenic profile, highly effective against diabetic chronic ulcers [105] . Thymol and tyrosol derived from EOs have been proposed as potential additives to antimicrobial dressings by providing both bactericidal and anti-inflammatory effects [106] . Encapsulated EOs are very common in wound healing [107] . For instance, peppermint EOs loaded into nanostructured lipid carriers have demonstrated important antibacterial effects against a wide range of pathogenic strains, aside from increasing wound contraction, fibroblast penetration, collagen deposition, and re-epithelialization [108] . In another study, cinnamon leaf oil, clove, and cajeput EOs embedded within wet-spun biodegradable microfibers were seen to act more quickly against S. aureus than the ampicillin antibiotic [109] .@story_separate@The response of the skin to microbial pathogen invasion is a highly coordinated phenomena that encompasses all skin layers and, in many cases, the skin microbiota. At a molecular level, the microbiota-produced antimicrobial factors, the host AMPs, and the antimicrobial lipids play a crucial role in fighting pathogenicity. However, the skin, on its own, is not always effective in fighting the penetration of bacteria, fungi, or viruses, and, as such, serious skin infectious may occur. Antimicrobial biomolecules, including antibiotics, AMPs, or plant extracts, may assist in overcoming this limitation. Their propensity to both control infections, eliminating pathogenic microorganisms, and be involved in important anti-inflammatory actions has rendered these biomolecules essential in medicine. Indeed, while inducing infection-solving immunity and regulating innate immunity, these antimicrobial biomolecules dampen and potentially damage pro-inflammatory reactions. Their varied roles and synergisms with innate substrates have been highlighted in the treatment of many skin infectious diseases. This review explored conventional and more recent therapeutic strategies based on active biomolecules to treat some of the most recurrent skin infections. Even though many do not consider skin infections a global problem and do not demand urgent solutions, modern research continues to dedicate its resources to finding more effective strategies that present the smallest impact on human health or our natural reserves.","In assigning priorities, skin infectious diseases are frequently classified as minor when compared to infectious diseases of high mortality rates, such as tuberculosis or HIV. However, skin infections are amongst the most common and prevalent diseases worldwide. Elderly individuals present an increased susceptibility to skin infections, which may develop atypical signs and symptoms or even complicate pre-existing chronic disorders. When the skin fails to correct or inhibit the action of certain pathogenic microorganisms, biomolecules endowed with antimicrobial features are frequently administered topically or systemically to assist or treat such conditions. (1) Antibiotics, (2) antimicrobial peptides, or (3) natural extracts display important features that can actively inhibit the propagation of these pathogens and prevent the evolution of infectious diseases. This review highlights the properties and mechanisms of action of these biomolecules, emphasizing their effects on the most prevalent and difficult to treat skin infections caused by pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The versatility of biomolecules’ actions, their symbiotic effects with skin cells and other inherent antimicrobial components, and their target-directed signatures are also explored here."
"The Coronavirus epidemic outbreak has currently caused great worldwide concern. Coronaviruses are single-strand, positive-sense RNA genomes ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length [1] . Coronaviruses can infect several birds and various mammals, including camels, bats, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, and cats [2, 3] . Coronavirus could cause different clinical diseases involving respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological systems [4] . When infected, people exhibited mild clinical symptoms [1] . However, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have caused more than 8,000 human infections (916 fatalities) and 2,574 human cases (886 deaths) by the end of April 2021 (from WHO resource, accessed May 16, 2021 [5] ), respectively. At the beginning of 2020, a new coronavirus was identified [6] [7] [8] . The virus has about 75%-80% homology to SARS-CoV, but divergent from MERS-CoV, wherefore it was named as SARS-CoV-2 [9, 10] @story_separate@As field investigators and clinicians, we used a standardized surveillance reporting form to gather epidemiological and clinical data. The cluster in our study involved five confirmed COVID-19 cases and a timeline to illustrate the details ( Figure 1 ). The first patient (case A) was back in Shanghai from Wuhan on Jan 17. Two days later, he developed physical discomfort and fatigue but did not go to the hospital. His body temperature was average and with no pulmonary symptoms. On Jan 27, three other families (case B, C, D) members also developed fever and were laboratory confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the following day, case E was home quarantine, together with a 3-year-old girl (the daughter of case E), till her confirmation to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 on the 18 th day after the first patient's returning to Shanghai. However, the 3-year-old girl was negative for the SARS-CoV-2. Detailed epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases are described in Table1. and at least 10,000 depth of sequence. Data analysis was predominantly conducted using CLC Genomics Workbench 7.5.1 software. Low-quality reads were trimmed using CLC trimmer, with a quality limit set at 0.05. According to this molecular typing method, the five strains in our study were divided into S-lineage (nt8782T and nt28144C), which was the main epidemic type in the early stages of the outbreak. It is speculated that S-lineage might be an older type. The experiments and protocols in this study were screened and approved @story_separate@Although many studies have been performed to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including its basic biology, treatments, animal source and vaccines, and so on [12] [13] [14] [15] , there are still many unknowns to be revealed. Wearing a mask and social distancing could break the transmission [16] [17] [18] [19] . This study analyzed the epidemiologic and virologic In summary, our results highlighted the contribution of personal protection equipment in disease prevention and control. In the epidemiological investigation, the evidence provided by case reports was less persuasive than results of well-designed studies wherein information was obtained following a specified protocol. The whole-genome sequence evidence provided the basis for the reliability of the transmission of the cluster in our study. In addition, more attention should be paid to the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Currently, limited knowledge is known for the SARS-CoV-2. More studies are urgently needed to prevent future epidemics of the virus.","The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 is currently continuing, and the World Health Organization has announced the risk assessment of the viruses as high. In this study, we analyzed virology features of SARS-CoV-2 causing a family cluster outbreak. Among the six family members, five have been laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 viruses. A total of five SARS-CoV-2 viruses have been isolated from the nasopharyngeal swabs. The complete genome of the viruses exhibited 100% nucleotide identity with each other. Only two nucleotide differences have been observed between genomes of the isolated viruses and the HCoV/Wuhan/ IVDC-HB-01/2019 strain. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed as the causation of the family cluster infections."
"The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, Sars-Cov-2, challenges the capabilities of health care services, especially in low-and middle-income countries. 1 A major issue is to meet the diagnostic requirements of the suspected cases reported to the surveillance system. 2 The proportion of suspected cases being tested in each country is not systematically presented in most of the epidemiological reports. [3] [4] [5] However, with the increasing number of new suspected cases of the disease (COVID- 19) worldwide, diagnosis has clearly become a growing problem, mainly due to the lack or delay in the test results. 6, 7 Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are unspecific and include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspnea, and viral pneumonia. 8, 9 Polymerase chain reaction by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, its limited availability and the strict laboratory requirements delay diagnosis, which represents an unprecedented challenge to control transmission and provide timely health care. 10, 11 The incorporation of predictive diagnostic models based on surveillance data could help identify patients who could need specific treatment and early isolation. Consequently, we aimed to describe the profile of COVID-19 patients and to obtain a multiple model to predict the diagnosis among suspected cases reported in Brazil based on data routinely collected by the surveillance system.@story_separate@This observational study corresponded to a developing and evaluation of diagnostic technologies, nested in surveillance data obtained by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. We studied the reported cases, which corresponded to the following case definition: patients with respiratory symptoms and fever, who had traveled to regions with community or local transmission or who had close contact with a suspected or confirmed case. We did not establish restrictions based on age or underlying conditions for this study. Records with inconsistent or illogical data were excluded. We included the patients reported between 11/01/2020 and 25/03/2020. All data were collected from the national surveillance information form, created on RedCap® platform, which included demographic, temporal, and easy to obtain clinical information such as symptoms, signs, comorbidities, travel history, and contact information. Another variable considered was the time since notification of the first case that was subsequently confirmed in the corresponding Federal Unit (FU). In the FU without notification and for its first confirmed case, this variable was zero. During the period of data collection analyzed, the ministry's recommendation was to test all suspected cases, according to the definition presented above. 12 SARS-CoV-2 infection was considered confirmed only by Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR testing, following the WHO and CDC protocol result for pharyngeal swab specimens. 11 Because the study population refers to symptomatic cases, in this paper we used the terms SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 interchangeably. Demographic and clinical information was entered in an electronic database and then analyzed using Excel and STATA (version 15.0, Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Data analysis included a description of the manifestations of the disease, according to etiology (COVID-19 vs. other illnesses [OI]). After descriptive analysis, the most functional form of the available variables was sought. This included the evaluation of composite variables for categorical predictors and the evaluation of the linear relationship between quantitative variables and the frequency of the outcome. Age showed a biological gradient with COVID-19; therefore, a simple imputation was made for cases . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20047944 doi: medRxiv preprint with missing values of this variable, considering the frequency of the diagnosis. Thus, the value of 37.38 years was calculated to impute unregistered age (in 1.4% of patients with etiological diagnosis). The information from São Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) was used to obtain and validate the predictive model. This choice was because these are the FUs with the largest number of confirmed cases and the earliest establishment of the surveillance system. Thus, we used a subset of 80% of randomly selected patients from SP and RJ (modeling dataset) to specify the multiple model. We selected the covariates by a non-automatic stepwise procedure using logistic regression. Age and days after notification of the first confirmed case (DNFCC) were used to create interaction terms with each other as an independent predictor. During modeling, a p-value of 0.15 was considered as a criterium to enter the variable and 0.20 to exclude it. After evaluating all the variables, exclusions were made until obtaining a model including only covariates with p <0. 10 . The values predicted by the multiple model obtained were used to estimate the area under the ROC curve (AUC). We interpreted the AUC as an indicator of goodness of fit such that values between 0.9 and 0.99 are excellent, 0.8 -0.89 good, 0.7 -0.79 acceptable, and 0.51 -0.69 are poor. 13 Next, the model was applied to the 20% of patients from SP and RJ who were not included in the modeling dataset (validation dataset). Moreover, we applied it to those from FUs other than SP/RJ to evaluate the applicability in a very different scenario. We also calculated the accuracy to classify events of a predicted probability of ≥ 0.5. 14 We presented some cut-off points of the predicted value based on optimized accuracy indicators (in SP/RJ patients). These cut-offs included: a preset predicted value of 0.5; the highest value with a sensitivity >95%; the lowest with specificity >95%; the value with the highest overall accuracy; and the value with the best balance between sensitivity and specificity (based on the product thereof). Accuracy indicators of these selected cutoffs were described for both the SP/RJ patients (modeling + validation dataset) and those from the other FUs. Finally, by applying the sum of the predicted values and by using the chosen cut-off points, we calculated the probable number of COVID-19 cases in the total reported patients and among those who were reported as being hospitalized. Until March 25, 2020, the surveillance system had received 67,344 records of suspected cases, including 5674 with registered hospitalization. Of the total, 165 records were excluded because of inconsistent data. Overall, 5739 were tested by RT-PCR, of which 1468 were positive and 4271 negative. COVID-19 cases were older and more frequently men compared with OI patients (Table 1) . COVID-19 patients were reported in median 16 days after the first confirmed case, which was significantly later than OI patients were (median of seven days). Both age and time from the first confirmed case exhibited a gradient for the COVID-19 frequency (Figures 1 and 2) . Most of the clinical manifestations were more frequent in OI patients than COVID-19 in the univariable analysis. Only the myalgia or arthralgia variable was significantly more frequent in COVID-19 than OI (30.7% vs. 23%, p<0.001). No COVID-19 infections were observed among patients with liver disease or among those that claimed not to have been in contact with a suspected case. On the other hand, COVID-19 patients less frequently referred to making a trip outside Brazil in the last 14 days (Table 1) . The states of SP and RJ jointly had 683 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 864 with OI, of which 541 and 702 were included in the modeling dataset, respectively. During the modeling, patients with liver disease (n = 4) and those who reported not having had contact with a suspected case (n = 69) were not considered, as these categories perfectly predicted absence of COVID-19 and were significantly more frequent in the OI group (Table 1) . .

The AUC of this multiple model was estimated at 95.36% (95% CI: 94.2 -96.52%) with an accuracy of 89.5%. To obtain the final function, patients with a history of liver disease and those who denied having had any contact with a suspected case were considered with a predicted value equal to zero. With this inclusion, the area was 95.54% (95% CI: 94.41% -96.67%) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the modeling dataset and 95.01% (92.51% -97.5%) in the validation dataset ( Figure 3 ). Accuracy in these datasets was 90.1% (sensitivity 87.62% and specificity 92.02%) and 89.47% (sensitivity 87.32% and specificity 91.36%), respectively. When this function was applied in patients from the other FUs, which included 785 cases of COVID-19 compared with 3407 with other diseases, the ROC area was 73.16% (95% CI: 71.35 -74.96%), and the accuracy was 73.43% (sensitivity 46.37% and specificity 79.66%). In table 4, we described the diagnostic accuracy indicators of selected predicted-value cutoffs in both the SP/RJ and the other FU groups. Considering the sum of predicted values as well as the different cutoffs, the number of COVID-19 cases among reported patients (adding together confirmed and predicted by our model) would be between 22826 and 25190 in SP/RJ, and between 22704 and 28837 in other FUs. Of them, between 2050 and 2196 were hospitalized in SP or RJ, and between 1657 and 2196 in the other FUs. All the calculations suggested that more than 95% of COVID-19 cases have not been confirmed. CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20047944 doi: medRxiv preprint  The growing number of cases suspected of COVID-19 is alarming. 15 Moreover, we observed that only a small proportion of the cases have a laboratory study. Therefore, most cases are being left with an uncertain diagnosis, which limits establishing specific measures and estimating the burden of the disease. In this study, we identified a set of variables that may help differentiate COVID-19 cases from other diseases. The model obtained exhibited an excellent AUC in the SP/RJ dataset comparable to more complex tools, including imaging and laboratory tests. 16, 17 This is impressive, considering that it is based solely on variables collected by the surveillance system. An essential caveat in these models is that the predictors should not be interpreted individually. However, some associations are consistent with what is known about this coronavirus. For example, age was directly associated with the diagnosis, which could be explained by the increased pathogenicity in older people. Therefore, an overrepresentation of the elderly is expected among the confirmed patients. Another interesting finding is the relationship between the time since the notification of the first confirmed case and the probability of COVID-19. This association indicates the importance of contextualizing according to the timing of the epidemic. Furthermore, this demonstrates that these models should be continuously updated and adapted to the epidemiological situation. Most of the clinical manifestations included in the model were negatively associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. It does not mean that they cannot be presented by patients with COVID-19, but that they are more frequent in other diseases. This finding highlights why the circulation of other infectious agents could be a determinant of the predictors' discriminatory capacity, as has already been suggested for other conditions. 18 Moreover, it is expected that variables determining the notification (e.g., respiratory symptoms and international travel) and, therefore, inclusion in the study, tend to be negatively associated with the outcome due to collider-like phenomena. 19 For this reason, both causal inference interpretation, and extrapolation to the general population of the associations would be biased. Consequently, our model must be considered only for diagnostic prediction in the specific group of reported suspected patients. The claim not to have had contact with an exposed case perfectly predicted the absence of COVID-19. This finding should be interpreted with caution because it is very likely that as the epidemic progresses, this variable could lose discrimination capacity once the prevalence of infectious hosts, including those undetectable, increases in the community. Regarding external application, we observed that the model had a considerably lower AUC in FUs other than SP and RJ. This difference could occur due to the epidemiological context variability, as well as different recording quality and heterogeneity in using definitions and reporting tools. Despite this, the AUC in these other FUs can be considered acceptable, and although lower, the model proposed could also help guide the preliminary diagnosis in scenarios different than those obtained. Applications of the proposed model include early case identification for specific treatment and isolation, as well as the rational use of laboratory tests. Moreover, this model may predict the number of both total cases and hospitalizations attributed to this infection based on the surveillance data. This application is relevant because one of the challenges that this pandemic represents is the organization of healthcare resources. In this way, our results may help to model and forecast the availability of funds for patient care.@story_separate@This study obtained and validated a model function suitable for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 during the early stage of the Brazilian epidemic. This tool was entirely based on data routinely collected. Therefore, it may help early identification and treatment of patients, establish preventive measures, and improve the accuracy of epidemiological surveillance of this disease. .

"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented interference in medical education [1] . During the last months, many countries took uncompromising measures in response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. These measures included the introduction of social and physical distancing, banning of public events [2] the prevention of non-essential travel and ultimately ""national lockdowns"" [1] 2. Schools and universities had to close which made it impossible for educational institutions to continue lectures as usual [3] . This situation prompted medical educators to respond at local and national levels [4] and educational institutions often switched face-to-face campus-based teaching to virtual platforms [3] [4] [5] . The rapid change in the medical education process is challenging for medical educational bodies and students. Medical schools and teaching hospitals must deliver teaching safely [3] whilst also ensuring the reliability and continuity of clinical education [1] 2 This might, above all, affect clinical rotations where interpersonal contact is inevitable [6] . A British survey reported that many students had assistantship placements postponed and electives Open Access BMC Research Notes *Correspondence: maximilian.storz@uniklinik-freiburg.de cancelled [2] . Lucey and Johnston argued that quarantine restrictions and institutional challenges in identifying sufficient clinical training sites for their students forced medical schools to suspend their usual practice of offering visiting elective rotations for senior students [4] . It is conceivable that the COVID-19 pandemic may therefore lead to a substantial reduction in abroad medical electives. However, data underpinning this assertion is yet scarce. Thus, we analyzed two German elective reports databases to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the international abroad elective frequency in students from the German-speaking countries.@story_separate@To undermine our hypothesis, we used two popular German online databases for medical elective experience testimonies. The free online database ""Famulaturranking"" (www. famul aturr anking. de) allows students to rate their medical electives and to share their experience by uploading elective reports. In Germany, medical students are required to complete 4 one-month elective clerkships during the clinical phase of their studies [7] 8. These clerkships are traditionally called ""Famulatur"", originating from the Latin word ""famulus"", which translates as ""servant"" [7] . It is popular among German students to perform at least one elective outside Germany. Upon completion, students frequently rate their experience at a particular hospital via ""Famulaturranking"". The categories ""country"", ""city"", ""hospital"" and ""duration"" are mandatory when a student uploads his rating. All reports are anonymous. The database is in German language and is mainly used by German, Austrian and Swiss students. For our analysis, we defined an abroad elective as an elective that was performed outside of Germany, Switzerland and Austria. In a second step, we examined another German online database which is specifically designated for final year medical elective experience reports. This database is called ""PJ Ranking"" (www. pjran king. de). ""PJ"" is the German abbreviation for ""Praktisches Jahr"", which can be translated as ""practical year"". This final stage of medical school is divided into three full-time clinical rotations, each lasting approximately 4 months [7] 8. While rotations in Surgery and Internal Medicine are mandatory, one rotation can be freely chosen from all the clinical specialties [7] . The specific time frames for each rotation are determined individually by the German universities. We analyzed the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Data extrapolation was performed in the last week of December 2020. Reports were copied to a Microsoft Excel file and analyzed using statistical software PSPP (GNU PSPP [Version 0.8.5]. Free Software Foundation, Boston). Duplicates of identical reports that were uploaded twice or more were removed. Results 3425 reports were uploaded to ""Famulaturranking"" between 2018 and 2020. 1009 reports were uploaded in 2018, 1181 reports in 2019 and 1235 reports in 2020 respectively. Figure 1 shows that the number of students reporting an elective in a non-German speaking country substantially declined during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020 till present). While 56 (56/1181) abroad elective experience reports were uploaded in 2019, the number fell to 25 (25/1235) in 2020. Conversely, the number of students reporting an elective in their home country increased (Fig. 1) . Analyzing the elective database ""PJ Ranking"", we identified another 7551 elective reports that were uploaded between 2018 and 2020. Again, we observed a notable decline in abroad elective reports in 2020 (Fig. 2) . Only 1.68% (30/1783) of testimonies reported an international medical elective. Prior to 2020, almost 5% of reports (156/3189) covered an abroad medical elective. This decline was more pronounced in final year electives compared to ""Famulatur"" clerkships. International medical electives have been associated with a large number of perceived benefits, including improved clinical examination skills, less dependency on expensive technology, a better understanding of tropical diseases and enhanced cross-cultural understanding [9]10 11. Using two German databases, we observed a substantial decline in abroad elective reports in 2020 in the Germanspeaking countries. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of reported abroad electives dropped by more than 50% compared to 2019. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to report such a decline in abroad elective reports in German-speaking medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results confirm an expected trend that has also been underlined by a recent report by Choi et al. [2] , who emphasized that many students in the United Kingdom had electives cancelled during the pandemic. Several explanations are conceivable for this phenomenon. Like most other countries, Germany, Austria and Switzerland have been heavily affected by travel restrictions. It is likely that many students had to cancel electives because they were unable to travel to their destination. Moreover, many institutions closed their international elective programs for foreign students. New policies were implemented to reduce unnecessary contacts and to prevent the spread of the virus. Therefore, students most likely encountered substantial difficulties to secure an abroad elective placement. It is also likely that students now experience a lack of funding and have insufficient financial resources to go abroad. While international electives are usually expensive, many students lost their revenue streams during the pandemic. Bars, restaurants and other small businesses had to close during the national lockdowns. Thus, it is conceivable that many students lost their jobs and encountered difficulties to cover the fees associated with an elective. Our findings might adversely affect students in various ways. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis and highlights the importance for future doctors to think globally. The lack of abroad elective opportunities could impede this and may hinder students' career progression. Moreover, the current paucity of international electives may also interfere with professional identity formation [12] . International medical graduates who are candidates for a job post or interested in an international career are negatively affected as well [13] . Elective periods are usually the only way for students to gain clinical experience and represent a crucial opportunity to receive letters of recommendation at the country of interest. Many residency programs require a minimum length of countrybased hands-on clinical experience and specify a certain number of mandatory references. Applying to these programs will certainly be harder for international medical graduates in the future. So-called ""tele-rotations"" were recently suggested as a potential solution to this, as they allow trainees to participate (in international electives) remotely from across the world and to connect with international health systems without travelling [14] . Whether tele-rotations may compensate for the lack of in-person electives is currently subject to a controversial debate and additional research is necessary to evaluate its role in undergraduate education. Our analysis has strengths and limitations that warrant further investigation. The large dataset behind this submission is somewhat unique and to the best of our knowledge, there are no other international databases that include a comparably high amount of elective reports. On the other hand, only a fraction of Germanspeaking students regularly uploads elective reports. It is neither mandatory nor are students being given credit for it. Furthermore, the number of ""PJ"" reports for 2020 was lower compared to 2019, since the year was not completed when we extrapolated the data. Some rotations end in December and it is likely that some students had not yet uploaded their reports at this time. Nevertheless, glancing at the current (global) travel restrictions, we believe that the number of international electives did not change much during the last two weeks of December.

The number of reported international electives in 2020 dropped by more than 50% compared to 2019. The long-term consequences of this phenomenon will be subject to future research.","OBJECTIVE: International medical electives are an essential part of medical education and popular among medical students. During the COVID-19 pandemic, however, many students had assistantship placements postponed and electives cancelled. Educational institutions switched face-to-face campus-based teaching to virtual platforms. Although it is conceivable that international medical electives were particularly affected by this development, numerical data on this phenomenon is yet scarce. To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the clinical elective behavior of German-speaking medical students, we systematically analyzed two large German online databases (Famulatur-Ranking and PJ-Ranking) cataloging medical elective experience testimonies. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic substantially reduced the number of German medical students undertaking abroad medical electives. Between 2018 and 2020, a total of 10,976 reports were uploaded to both databases. We observed a notable decline in abroad elective reports in 2020. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, almost 5% of reports uploaded to “PJ-ranking” covered an international medical elective. This number dropped to 1.68% in 2020. Analyzing “Famulaturranking”, we observed a comparable phenomenon. While 4.74% of reports in 2019 covered an international elective, the number dropped to 2.02% in 2020. The long-term consequences of this phenomenon will be subject to future research."
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, originated in China in December 2019 and rapidly progressed into an epidemic infection, such that the World Health Organization (WHO) termed this calamitous virus ""coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"". [1] [2] [3] The majority of the early investigations focused on how SARS-CoV-2 attacks the respiratory system and elicits typical symptoms in most patients; nonetheless, new research disturbingly indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can also attack the central nervous system (CNS) in a variety of ways and even cause long-term damage or death. 4 Neurological complications in COVID- 19 infection have yet to be sufficiently elucidated. Patients with such complications may present with changes in their level of consciousness (e.g., acute encephalopathy). Acute infections increase the risk of altered mental status, especially in elderly patients with chronic medical illnesses. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] We herein present an update on the neurological pathogenesis and manifestations of Coronaviruses (CoVs) and briefly discuss the latest findings on SARS-CoV-2 neuroinfection in the limited literature.@story_separate@What's Known • COVID-19 is a pandemic whose neurological complications need clarification. Similar to other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 may enter the central nervous system via the hematogenous or neuronal route. While facing patients with any neurological markers, medical services suppliers should consider SARS-CoV-2 as a differential diagnosis to avoid misdiagnosis. • There isn't any worldwide significant data about neurological manifestation and complications of COVID-19 virus. We herein provide an update on the neurological pathogenesis and manifestations of coronaviruses and briefly discuss the latest findings on SARS-CoV-2 neuroinfection. Previous research shows that the central nervous system (CNS) is not immune to infectioninduced changes, be they acute or latent. A wide spectrum of viruses attack the CNS of humans by infecting different specific cells such as neurons and, thus, produce neural diseases. 7 In clinical practice, however, a precise evaluation of the incidence of viral infections poses a challenge. By way of example, viral presence can be detected only in up to 30 cases out of 100 000 cases in the most prevalent viruses known to induce encephalitis (i.e., herpes viruses, arboviruses, and enteroviruses). 8 Some researchers have posited that the clinical picture of viral infections is often nonspecific and needs the clinician to consider various diagnoses, 7 the most significant of which are meningitis, which produces such typical symptoms as fever, neck stiffness, and photophobia; encephalitis, whose signs and symptoms can be nonexistent by may cause confusion, speech disorders, and unusual activities; focal neurological deficits such as hemiparesis and paralysis; syndromes of movement disorders; and seizure. 9 Accordingly, the classification of the viral etiology of a neurological condition requires a thorough history taking and physical examination of the patient. [9] [10] [11] [12]  CoVs are enveloped single-stranded Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses 13-15 that belong to the Coronaviridae family. 16 Human pathogenic CoVs comprise HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoVHKU1, HCoV-NL63, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), [17] [18] [19] all of which are capable of creating a variety of respiratory infections such as common colds, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. 18 Numerous studies have also connected CoVs to CNS diseases such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis. [20] [21] [22] History of the Pathogenicity of the Neuroinfection of Coronaviruses CoVs are universal animal pathogens that can produce systemic and neurological illnesses in infected animals. CoVs lead to upper respiratory tract diseases 23 and are associated with gastroenteritis 24 in humans. There are, however, two reports that posit a relationship between CoVs and human demyelinating disease. In one of these reports, the coronavirus was separated from the brains of two patients with multiple sclerosis patients. 25 The other report was on the observation of the coronavirus via electron microscopy in the brain immunocytes of a patient with multiple sclerosis. 26 An article published in 1956 reported the intracerebral inoculation of a 10% homogenate of a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) JHM-infected mouse brain into rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) induced the acute manifestations of panencephalitis. 27  Immune responses mediated by T lymphocytes in the CNS can be both beneficial in that they can clear inflammation mediators and harmful in that they may destroy neural tissues and activate autoimmunity and glial cells. The CNS responds swiftly to coronavirus involvement by recruiting the chemokine mediators of specific T cells. The detection of antigens expressed by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is vital in triggering antigen-specific T cells. However, extensive T-cell stimulation and selfantigen stimulation can finally produce disorders such as demyelination. Some mediators such as interferon regulatory factor 7 (IFN-7) may exert undesirable effects by employing macrophages and inducing the excessive secretion of astrocyte chemokines. [28] [29] [30] Dissimilar to the cytolytic mechanisms expressed in acute infection, the immunity induced by the nonlytic humoral pathway succeeds in controlling infectious viruses through persistence. The current data appear to confirm CNS infection by SARS-CoV. 31  Some investigations have reported high serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in patients with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. 32, 33 Some other studies have demonstrated considerable accumulation of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with the CoV infection of the CNS. IL-6 has both neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties and can increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. 34 A high level of IL-6 causes advanced neurological disorders. 35 A study in Japan on experimental mouse encephalitis verified that IL-8 played a vital role in inflammatory responses such as injury to the brain. 36 MCP-1 is a chemokine that can recruit the migration of monocytes across the blood-brain barrier and invite inflammatory cells into the CNS. What ensues is the entry of virus-infected cells, an increased inflammatory response, and injury to the brain, particularly encephalitis. 37, 38  Virus) The existing data show that the newly disseminated coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) shares similar pathogenesis with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the induction of pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 uses a similar receptor to enter the human host cells. [39] [40] [41] Increasing evidence indicates that neurotropism is an important feature of CoVs. Consequently, it is crucial to understand whether SARS-CoV-2 can increase entrance to the CNS and induce neuronal damage, resulting in acute respiratory distress and death. [42] [43] [44] This neuroinvasive capability of CoVs has been recognized very nearly for all CoVs such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, as well as mouse hepatitis virus and porcine hepatitis E. [45] [46] [47] Neuroinvasive Potential of SARS-CoV-2 (Last Update) The particular pathway by which SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV arrives in the CNS has yet to be determined. Nevertheless, the lymphatic or hematogenous route appears to be likely, particularly in the primary stage of the infection, when almost no particle of the virus has thus far been identified in non-neuronal cells. [31] [32] [33] Growing evidence indicates that CoVs can reach the CNS after attacking peripheral nerve elements. [44] [45] [46] In the years 2002 and 2003, some investigations reported the presence of SARS-CoV elements in the CNS, especially in the brain neuron cells. 31, 48, 49 Further studies afterward demonstrated that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV might intranasally, perhaps by way of the olfactory nerves, enter the brain and swiftly spread to some particular brain regions such as the brainstem and the thalamus. Amongst these areas, the brainstem has been verified to be severely infected by these viruses. [50] [51] [52] The access of SARS-CoV into host cells is supported mostly by a cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in the human respiratory system, small intestine, and kidney cells. Conversely, the existence of this enzyme uniquely is not adequate to make host cells vulnerable to infection. [53] [54] [55] SARS-CoV-2 also has comparable potential. An epidemiological study on COVID-19 informed that the normal time from the first warning sign to dyspnea was five days, to hospital admission was 7 days and to the intensive care unit (ICU) was eight days. Consequently, the latency phase could be enough for the virus to entree and demolish the medulla oblongata. Previous studies have also reported that some patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed neurological symptoms such as headache, ataxia, and convulsion. 6, 56, 57 In a recent study on 214 patients with COVID-19, Mao and others 6 found that almost 88% of the patients with severe infection exhibited neurological signs such as acute cerebrovascular disease and altered mental status. Hence, awareness of the potential neuroinvasion can have guiding importance for the management of COVID-19-induced respiratory catastrophes. Therefore, similar to more respiratory viruses, SARS-COV-2 can go into the brain through blood or neuronal systems. The presence of hyposmia in some patients supports the notion that the virus may enter the CNS via the neuronal pathway. There has been a report of the identification of the SARS-CoV nucleic acid in the CSF and brain tissue of patients with COVID-19. 4 On March 4, 2020, Jingyuan 5 described a middle age patient with pneumonia in whose CSF SARS-CoV-2 was identified by genetic sequencing. The report also stated that despite the presence of signs and related to central nervous system damage, but brain imaging failed to expose any abnormalities and biochemical tests were normal for the CSF. Fortunately, however, the diagnostic test on the cerebrospinal fluid of the patient showing the existence of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and treatment for viral encephalitis was commenced. On March 21, 2020, Filatov and others 1 described a 74-year-old man with respiratory disease, convulsion, altered mental status, and confusion who was diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient, however, exhibited no CSF evidence of CNS infection. The authors recommended awareness concerning the manifestations of encephalopathy in patients in the acute phase of COVID-19. In a review published on February 27, 2020, Yan-Chao and colleagues 57 of Jilin University in China concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could contaminate nerve cells, chiefly neurons in the medulla oblongata (part of the brainstem that functions as the control center for the heart and the lungs). The injury could be related to acute respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19. Indeed, while the bulk of research conducted and published thus far has focused on the mechanisms whereby SARS-CoV-2 targets the respiratory system, more recent investigations have reported disconcerting evidence of the entrance of this new coronavirus into the CNS via different ways, resulting in significant damage to this system or even death due to its infection. Some investigators in China reported that more than 30% of their 214 patients with COVID-19 presented with neurological signs and symptoms; they, therefore, concluded that SARS-CoV-2 might attack the CNS through blood or retrograde neuronal routes, causing the destruction of the CNS. 6 Most recently, we described a female patient who referred with exclusive manifestations. Our patient had altered mental status, the involvement of Brain basal ganglia, most probably due to COVID-19. She presented with respiratory manifestations and computed tomography scanconfirmed lung involvement typically matched by COVID-19 infection. We successfully treated her with routine anti-coronavirus drugs. What all the aforementioned cases indicate is that COVID-19 may have different types of CNS involvement that should be considered. 5 There have also been reports of low lymphocyte counts in patients with COVID-19 who had neurological manifestations by comparison with patients with COVID-19 who had no such manifestations, which hints at the possibility that patients with CNS involvement may have various degrees of COVID-19induced immunosuppression effects, particularly in the severe phase of the disease. A study reported high D-dimer levels in severe COVID-19 in comparison with non-severe COVID-19, indicating that the prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases may be higher in severely ill patients. 6 Muscle Involvement in COVID- 19 The latest reports on COVID-19 indicate the high incidence of muscle symptoms. 2 Moreover, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels have been reported to be higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in those with nonsevere COVID-19, which could be correlated with the presence of ACE2 in skeletal muscles. 56 Consequently, whether SARS-CoV-2 infects muscle cells by binding to ACE2 receptors needs further research. It is also deserving of note that significantly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum can produce muscle injury. 56  Stroke: In some new articles, the incidence rate of ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19 is up to 2.5%. 58 There are also reports regarding a relationship between inflammation and resultant coagulopathy by IL-6 and fibrinogen due to damage to the lung alveoli. 59 The pathophysiology of the prothrombotic state subsequent to viral infections has been widely recognized. Patients' susceptibility to coagulopathy and thrombotic events can be explained by prolonged stays in intensive care units and disabilities. 59, 60 Guillain-Barré syndrome: Some reports are indicating that this syndrome could be one of the considerable neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2. 60 The most likely mechanism is that antibodies against some surface glycoproteins are expressed against foreign antigens that also respond to the parallel native protein structure on the neurons. Nevertheless, the lack of relevant data and the complexity of establishing a causal relationship between a single pathogen and the syndrome make it extremely difficult to assess the robustness of the reported evidence. 60 Cerebrospinal fluid: As yet, there is no specific CSF analysis feature in COVID-19 infection with neurological manifestations (especially encephalopathy), and the reported results thus far have been normal. Still, diagnostic tests on the CSF of patients may be essential to the diagnosis of COVID-19 neuroinfection. 1, 5  New data analyses on COVID-19 indicate a noticeable incidence of neurological disorders, especially in more severe infection. The neurological disorders in COVID-19 may constitute a neurological tableau of a direct viral infection, neurological sequelae after the resolution of the infection, and infection in patients with chronic neurological diseases, not lease those who require immune-suppressive medications (e.g., multiple sclerosis). 6 In light of the reported findings, the neurological signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinfection may indicate the involvement of the CNS, creating such symptoms as headache, altered mental status, and epilepsy; the peripheral nervous system, creating such significant symptoms as hyposmia; and the skeletal muscles. 6@story_separate@Based on the findings presented here, it can be concluded that similar to other respiratory viruses, SARS-COV-2 may enter the brain via the hematogenous or neuronal route. Hyposmia may be deemed evidence of the neuroinvasion capability of SARS-COV-2 via the olfactory route. Indeed, what the ACE2 theory posits is that SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for some neurological manifestations. In the current epidemic era of COVID-19, it is highly advisable that healthcare workers take into account SARS-CoV-2 infection as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with any neurological indicators to avoid misdiagnosis and the transmission of this contagious infection. The ACE2 theory indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may induce some neurological manifestations via direct or indirect mechanisms. Finally, gaining an insight into the pathways of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion would further clarify the neurological pathogenesis and manifestations of CoVs and enhance the management and treatment of this group of patients.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection. Similar to other respiratory viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) may enter the brain via the hematogenous or neuronal route; however, only a few reports are available on the neurological complications of COVID-19. Encephalopathy is a significant neurological complication of COVID-19. We herein present an update on the virology, neurological pathogenesis, and neuroinvasive potential of coronaviruses and briefly discuss the latest findings on SARS-CoV-2 neuroinfection. The reports thus far indicate that the access of SARS-CoV into host cells is bolstered chiefly by a cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and that SARS-CoV-2 may induce some neurological manifestations via direct or indirect mechanisms. Further research is required to shed sufficient light on the impact on the central nervous system and altered mental status in patients with COVID-19. Indeed, a better understanding of the pathways of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion would further clarify the neurological pathogenesis and manifestations of coronaviruses and enhance the management and treatment of this group of patients. In the current epidemic era of COVID-19, health care staff should strongly become aware of SARS-CoV-2 infection as an essential diagnosis to get away misdiagnosis and prevention of transmission."
"In the urgent search for effective therapies against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , a wide range of candidates has emerged as potential drugs to be incorporated into the therapeutic armamentarium. In this regard, the endocytic pathway has been targeted as a therapeutic strategy in COVID-19 [1] . Several groups have identified amiodarone as a candidate drug for use against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2, 3] . Some have recommended administration of prophylactic intravenous amiodarone to mitigate the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) among patients infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2 [4] . A randomized study called ReCOVery-SIRIO has been started to evaluate the effects of amiodarone compared with usual care in symptomatic patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04351763). Amiodarone is among the most widely prescribed antiarrhythmic drugs to treat both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, while also being important for maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) [5] . Although it does not decrease all-cause mortality in the primary prevention population, amiodarone is the most effective antiarrhythmic drug to prevent SCD [5] . Importantly, amiodarone reduces automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shocks, being a first relatively easily available treatment option in patients experiencing electrical storm and repeated ventricular arrhythmias leading to recurrent ICD shocks [6] . In addition, amiodarone possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [7, 8] , i.e. pleiotropic effects, which can indirectly suppress ventricular arrhythmias [5] . However, amiodarone is not free of secondary adverse effects, contraindications and interactions with other drugs, including the potential to cause pulmonary toxicity and fibrosis, thyroid disease, hepatic toxicity, increased creatine levels, QT interval prolongation, and bradyarrhythmia [9] . Most of these adverse effects are more likely with long-term use of amiodarone. COVID-19 seems to be associated with higher rates of arrhythmia, either pre-existing or secondary to the disease [10, 11] . COVID-19 patients are at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which makes amiodarone less attractive, but the sickest patients with viral infection have limited antiarrhythmic options. Thus, one question arises: can we use amiodarone to treat arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients? Arrhythmias, particularly AF, are common in COVID-19 patients, and amiodarone may be an effective and additive antiarrhythmic drug in these patients. We present here the rationale for amiodarone use in the COVID-19 scenario, as well as whether or not amiodarone administration represents a potential strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, rather than simply used to treat patients already symptomatic and/or with severe COVID-19, based on current evidence.@story_separate@There is evidence that cationic amphiphilic drugs should be studied for possible interference with the life cycle of positive-stranded RNA viruses [12] . Specifically, the cationic amphiphilic drug amiodarone and its major metabolite N-desethylamiodarone (N-DEA) inhibit the entry of filoviruses (a family that includes Ebola virus) at similar concentrations to those found in the blood of patients treated for arrhythmias [13] . Amiodarone can interfere with SARS-CoV entry and amplification, and is able to block the spread of SARS-CoV in cell cultures by inhibiting infection at a postendosomal level. It accomplishes this without modifying the density of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors on the cell surface or interfering with the attachment of SARS-CoV to the cells [14] . Thus, amiodarone has been described as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV spread through its ability to interfere with the endocytic pathway and by blocking ion channels, even when SARS-CoV could deliver its genome into the cytoplasm through the plasma membrane, thus bypassing the endocytic compartment [14] . Recently, Aimo et al. [15] proposed amiodarone as a candidate treatment of COVID-19 infection, either alone or as part of a combination of drugs. The authors also speculated that amiodarone administration is more effective in the setting of low viral loads, suggesting that amiodarone should be evaluated for use in previously exposed but asymptomatic individuals. ReCOVery-SIRIO is a multicenter effort investigating the role of amiodarone in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 during the initial stages of infection to target virus replication by ion channel inhibition. This effect might be instrumental to attenuate virus entrance and replication before the cytokine storm caused by host immune response ( Fig. 1 ). COVID-19 is associated with a high inflammatory burden [16] , which may lead to vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias. It has been suggested that amiodarone administration prevents cytokine production and oxidative stress, which may protect lung tissue during the sepsis cascade. Particularly, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the activation of dendritic cells and cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, which activates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, among others [17] . Moreover, angiotensin 1,7 (Ang 1,7) activity also decreases, leading to vasoconstrictive, inflammatory, oxidative, and fibrotic injuries [17] . Regarding proinflammatory cytokines, Polat et al. [7] reported that the administration of amiodarone 25-50 mg/ kg decreased the circulating levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα, as well as 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α levels in lung tissue of amiodarone-treated rats. Likewise, both the activity of superoxide dismutase and total glutathione levels increased in lung tissue [7] . This is consistent with Matsumori et al. [8] , who showed that amiodarone inhibited IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In a murine model of viral myocarditis induced by the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Ito et al. [18] also reported that amiodarone administration (30 mg/kg/day; equivalent to 2.5 mg/kg in humans) significantly decreased IL-6 concentration in myocardial tissue and increased survival, while TNFα levels did not change. Noticeably, the production of these cytokines was enhanced by administering other antiarrhythmic drugs such as quinidine and disopyramide [8] . Oral et al. [19] evaluated the effect of chronic amiodarone use on TNFα levels in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. To this end, the authors analyzed circulating TNFα levels at baseline and at 1 and 2 years in 40 New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III patients treated with placebo and 40 NYHA class III patients treated with amiodarone. No changes were found in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, while amiodarone use increased TNFα levels in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy at 1 year but not at 2 years, which suggests different effects of amiodarone depending on the duration of administration. In monocytes of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), Hirasawa et al. [20] found that amiodarone administration for 4 weeks attenuated monocyte cytokine and chemokine production in response to C-reactive protein (CRP), particularly decreasing both TNFα and MCP-1. These authors speculated that amiodarone might improve cardiac function through its anti-inflammatory effects, although this has not yet been proven in living humans. Regarding the mechanism involved in the reduction of certain cytokines, such as IL-6 or TNFα, it has been hypothesized that amiodarone reduces their production by modulating the voltage-gated potassium channel, which regulates the activation of T lymphocytes [18] , although further investigation is needed to clarify the specific mechanisms. On the other hand, oxidative stress also plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease and heart failure, therefore improvements in antioxidant capacity might be beneficial in the treatment of these patients. Halici et al. [21] studied the effects of amiodarone administration on glutathione levels and the activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase and myeloperoxidase, in rats with carrageenan-induced paw edema. In this investigation, amiodarone reduced carrageenan-induced paw edema, relieved increases in the activities of catalase and glutathione S-transferase enzymes, minimized decreases in glutathione levels and the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase enzymes, and amplified myeloperoxidase activity associated with paw edema. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of amiodarone may be related to its antioxidative effects. Ide et al. [22] determined the scavenging effects of amiodarone on oxygen free radicals, and its protective effects against oxygen radical-mediated injury in cardiac myocytes. Amiodarone decreased the intensity of the 5,5-dimethyl pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO)-OH signals in a dose-dependent manner, whereas disopyramide and atenolol had no such effects. Amiodarone also protected intact adult canine cardiac myocytes against ·OH-mediated myocyte injury at a concentration of 10 mmol/L, which suggests that amiodarone can protect cardiac myocytes against oxidative stress-mediated injury by directly scavenging oxygen free radicals [22] . Therefore, although the precise molecular mechanism by which amiodarone exerts an anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant effect remains unclear, amiodarone-induced inhibition of cytokine and chemokine production and antioxidant capacity improvement may be critical factors mediating potential amiodarone-positive effects on COVID-19 therapy [23] . The use of amiodarone has significant limitations. In brief, during the early months of the pandemic, the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was widely recommended to treat COVID-19; however, this treatment remains highly controversial in terms of efficacy and may prolong QTc. Amiodarone might aggravate this QT prolongation, which is associated with an increased risk of SCD [24] . Furthermore, the clinical application of amiodarone is limited by its marked extracardiac toxicity. Amiodarone has been associated with hepatic transaminitis, thyroid dysfunction, and pulmonary toxicity, although these adverse effects are directly related to the duration of treatment (amiodarone toxicity is cumulative and dose-dependent) [25] . Amiodarone's iodine moieties and extreme lipophilic character importantly contribute to its toxicity. Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity can occur following acute or chronic treatment and is characterized by acute pulmonary hypersensitivity with patchy infiltrates or chronic pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, respectively. It is important to keep in mind that amiodarone-induced pulmonary fibrosis is a rare event that typically occurs after months to years of continued drug administration. It has also been shown that prehospital use of amiodarone may independently increase the risk for ARDS in patients with predisposing conditions for acute lung injury (ALI) [26] . Contributing factors to amiodaroneinduced pulmonary toxicity include its direct cytotoxic effects (principally mediated by N-DEA), phospholipidosis, immunological mechanisms, and activation of the angiotensin system; however, the precise mechanisms contributing to amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity remain incompletely understood. Importantly, pulmonary toxicity is more common in older people, increasing threefold every 10 years of age in patients aged over 60 years. Moreover, amiodarone affects metabolism, increasing circulating levels of other drugs such as warfarin, digoxin, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, statins and benzodiazepines. Amiodarone also interacts with many antiretroviral medications used for the treatment of HIV infection. Finally, dronedarone, an amiodarone derivate, has also been identified as an active inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 virus among a panel of US FDAapproved drugs screened to identify antiviral drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment [27] . Because dronedarone is less lipophilic than amiodarone, it has a smaller volume of distribution and a shorter elimination half-life, which ultimately reduces its toxicity. These features make dronedarone a worthwhile candidate to be considered.@story_separate@First, despite the positive effects mentioned above, it should be noted that evidence on amiodarone use in COVID-19 patients is still scarce; we need to stay cautious and remain attentive to the expected results of the ongoing clinical trial in order to obtain more robust conclusions. That being said, the safety/risk profile of amiodarone is well known and it appears to be another candidate for clinical trials in the current COVID-19 scenario. A short-term use of amiodarone is relatively well tolerated. It may be speculated that amiodarone is more efficient with low viral loads and at the early stages of the COVID-19 infection. Accordingly, clinical trials of amiodarone should be mainly performed in individuals who are currently asymptomatic or with early disease, rather than severely symptomatic patients with severe COVID-19 infection. In the former, amiodarone should be better evaluated as an adjuvant drug. We must keep in mind that COVID-19 is characterized by ALI [9] , and this could potentially be aggravated by long-term amiodarone administration. Therefore, shorter-term intervention trials with amiodarone could be preferred in the first stages of future studies. Moreover, in our opinion, retrospective and prospective studies in asymptomatic individuals previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, as well as the incidence of infection between the present and prior users of amiodarone, are recommended. While we wait for newly emerging evidence, arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients should be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs in the same manner as patients who are not infected with COVID-19. Arrhythmias, particularly AF, are common in COVID-19 and are associated with higher risk for morbidity and mortality. Amiodarone may be a particularly effective antiarrhythmic agent for these hospitalized patients who are prone to supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, although its safety and efficacy have to be better studied before wider-scale clinical recommendations.","Amiodarone, one of the most widely prescribed antiarrhythmic drugs to treat both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, has been identified as a candidate drug for use against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We present the rationale of using amiodarone in the COVID-19 scenario, as well as whether or not amiodarone administration represents a potential strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, rather than simply used to treat patients already symptomatic and/or with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), based on current evidence."
". SARS was first recognized in China in November 2002 and subsequently spread to 29 other countries, thus emerging as the first nearpandemic infectious disease of the twenty-first century. A worldwide total of 8,096 cases of SARS, of which 774 (9.6%) resulted in death, was reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_ 21/en/index.html). SARS-CoV belongs to the Coronaviridae family (order Nidovirales) of enveloped single-stranded positive RNA viruses (Marra et al. 2003; Rota et al. 2003; Thiel et al. 2003) . The SARS-CoV genome is approximately 30 kb in length and is the longest known amongst the RNA virus genomes. The SARS-CoV genomic RNA has a cap structure and a poly-A tail at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends, respectively. SARS-CoV genome replication occurs in the cytoplasm. During viral replication, a full-length genomic negative-stranded RNA is transcribed from genomic positivestranded RNA by the viral RNA polymerase that is initially translated from genomic RNA. Approximately 60% of SARS-CoV genomic RNA encodes viral polymerase and its related proteins. The mRNA transcription of coronavirus is unique, because all mRNAs have a nested set structure. The mRNAs have a 5 0 leader sequence of approximately 70 nucleotides and poly-A tails at the 3 0 end. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which is a prototype of coronavirus, has seven mRNAs, whereas SARS-CoV has at least nine mRNAs. The leader RNA is transcribed from the 3 0 end of full-length genomic negative-stranded RNA. There is strong evidence that the leader RNA is transcribed as small sized-RNA, which is approximately 70 bases in length. The leader RNA binds to intragenic initiation sites on negative-stranded RNA, and then viral RNA polymerase starts to transcribe mRNA at the site. The SARS-CoV viral genomic RNA comprises 14 open reading frames (ORFs), and eight of the encoded proteins are unique compared with other coronaviruses. These unique proteins are thought to be involved in the pathogenetic mechanism of SARS-CoV. Large overlapping polyproteins (1a and 1b) encoded by approximately 60% of the SARS-CoV viral genome are processed into 16 nonstructural proteins including polymerase and proteases (chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease and papain-like protease). These proteins are thought to be essential in viral replication and transcription. The viral particle of SARS-CoV mainly consists of four structural proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) (Fig. 19 .1). The viral particle may also comprise viral accessory proteins that bind to the structural proteins. The S protein binds to the viral receptor of host cells and enables the virus to enter the cytoplasm by endocytosis. SARS-CoV has the potential to cause respiratory illness in human patients. Cytokine storm occurs in SARS-CoV-infected patients and is one of the observed pathologic mechanisms of SARS-CoV infection. On the other hand, apoptotic cell death is observed in vitro when SARS-CoV-sensitive cultured cells such as Vero E6 cells are used (Mizutani et al. 2004c) . Various signaling pathways are activated during the entire process of viral infection, from S protein-ACE2 (Angiotensinconverting enzyme-2) binding for internalization into the host cells to apoptotic cell death (Mizutani 2007) . The most common signaling pathways are mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which include Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 MAPK. These three major MAPKs are highly conserved in a wide range of species from yeast to mammals and are regulatory proteins of cell death and cell survival in living cells. Thus, MAPKs are key to the process of apoptosis (Garrington and Johnson 1999) . MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK) activates MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and then MAPKK activates MAPK. Generally, the ERK signaling pathway promotes cell survival and proliferation, and JNK and p38 MAPK induce apoptosis. However, the role of each MAPK varies depending on cell type and stimulation. Many signaling pathways are activated in virus-infected cells, and cross-talk activation between signaling pathways occurs. Thus, signaling pathways regulating cell death and survival in virus-infected cells is highly complex. Analysis of activated signaling pathways in SARS-CoV-infected cells and patients is required for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS. This review highlights recent progress in characterizing signal transduction pathways induced by SARS-CoV infection in vivo and in vitro.@story_separate@The p38 MAP kinase is expressed in response to stressors, and viral infection generally induces activation of p38 MAPK. The roles of p38 MAPK in viral infection/replication have been researched recently as described below. Environmental stresses, such as UV irradiation, oxidative stimuli and proinflammatory cytokines, are able to induce activation of p38 MAPK. There are at least four isoforms of p38 MAPK: p38a, p38b, p38g, and p38d _ 1999; Platanias 2003; Lee et al. 2004 ), but these isoforms are generally not distinguished in the field of virology. However, these four isoforms exhibit different properties and have MAPKs have more than 70% similarity at the amino acid sequence level, and their functions are inhibited by the pyridinyl imidazole inhibitor SB203580 [4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) imidazole]. Conversely, p38g and p38d MAPKs, which have 60% similarity to p38a, are not inhibited by SB203580. Furthermore, p38a and p38b MAPKs are widely expressed in tissues, whereas the expression of p38g and p38d MAPKs is tissue-specific. In the field of virology, because SB203580 is generally used as an inhibitor of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, it can be used in studying the role of p38a and/or p38b MAPKs in SARS-CoV infection. The kinases upstream of p38 MAPK are MKK3 (MAPK kinase 3) and MKK6 (MAPK kinase 6), which are known to phosphorylate and activate p38 MAPK. Interestingly, MKK6 has affinity to PKR in the presence of double-stranded RNA, poly(rI;rC) and PKR is able to activate MKK6, but not MKK3. This result indicated that interaction of MKK6 and PKR provides a mechanism to regulate activation of p38 MAPK (Silva et al. 2004) . In hepatitis C virus-core-expressing cells, PKR has an important role in cell cycle arrest and was shown to interact strongly with p38 MAPK (Spaziani et al. 2006) . As upstream of p38MAPK, transforming growth factor (TGF)-b-activating kinase (TAK1), apoptosis signal-regulatory kinase (ASK1), and MAPKKK4 are known as MAPKKKs. Downstream targets of p38 MAPK are well-known as mitogen and stressactivated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), MAP kinase-interacting kinase 1 (MNK1), and MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 and 3 (MAPKAPK 2 and 3) (Freshney et al. 1994 ). These signaling pathway proteins have further downstream targets. For example, MNK1 activates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) (Gingras et al. 1999) . MAPKAPK2 activates heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and transcription factor-1 (ATF-1) (Garrido et al. 2003; Tan et al. 1996) . Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 strain induces interleukin-6 (IL-6) production via eIF4E phosphorylation under p38 MAPK activation (Banerjee et al. 2002) . Inhibitors of p38 MAPK inhibit transcription of viral mRNA and production of viral protein, indicating that p38 MAPK is utilized to promote viral protein synthesis. Conversely, p38 MAPK enhances transcription of CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) encoded by the growth arrest-and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153) (Wang et al. 1996) . The p38 MAPK-induced apoptosis via activation of the CHOP pathway occurs in cells infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (Su et al. 2002) . The H5N1 subtype of influenza virus induces tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) expression via activation of p38 MAPK (Lee et al. 2005) . The p38 MAPK signaling pathway is thought to primarily induce apoptosis in virus-infected cells. As described in HCV infection, p38 MAPK is able to promote cell survival. Although p38 MAPK is activated in many cases of viral infection, viral proteins sometimes negatively regulate p38 MAPK. The ORF 61 protein of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is known to repress phosphorylation of p38 MAPK for negative regulation of cellular proinflammatory responses (Rahaus et al. 2005 ). Thus, activation or inactivation of p38 MAPK occurs in the pathogenesis of disease caused by viral infection. The p38 MAPK signaling pathway takes part in cell death, as previously described. Apoptosis is an active and physiologic type of cell death and is a host cell's protective mechanism for preventing the spread of viral particles before production of viral particles. Vero and Vero E6 cells, which are monkey kidney cells, are widely used in SARS-CoV research because of their high susceptibilities to infection due to lack of interferon genes. Apoptosis has been shown to be inducible by infection with SARS-CoV (Mizutani et al. 2004c; Yan et al. 2004) . Cytopathic effects (CPEs), defined as focal cell rounding and DNA fragmentation typical of apoptosis, are observed in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells at 24 h post-infection (h.p.i.) (Mizutani et al. 2004c ). Activated caspase 3, which has an essential role in apoptosis, was detected at peak levels at 24 h.p.i. On the other hand, the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK reached a maximum at 18 h.p.i. in virus-infected cells. The phosphorylated p38 MAPK was active, as shown by using an in vitro kinase assay. The CPE observed in SARS-CoV-infected cells is slightly inhibited by SB203580, and therefore p38 MAPK activation is thought to induce CPE of virus-infected cells. However, DNA fragmentation is not inhibited by the inhibitor. Apoptosis and CPE are thought to be linked, and activation of p38 MAPK is a promoter of cell death in Vero E6 cells infected by SARS-CoV. However, SB203580 treatment of Vero E6 cells indicates that there is no requirement for p38 MAPK activation in SARS-CoV replication. The p38 MAPK signaling pathway perhaps has other roles in SARS-CoV-infected cells. The downstream targets of p38 MAPK are phosphorylated in SARS-CoVinfected cells. The level of phosphorylated eIF4E is increased in SARS-CoVinfected cells (Mizutani et al. 2004c ). However, the activated eIF4E does not regulate viral protein synthesis, as demonstrated by the similar kinetics of viral protein accumulation in infected Vero E6 cells in the presence and absence of SB203580. Both MAPKAPK-2 and its substrate HSP-27 are phosphorylated in virus-infected cells. HSP-27 is known as an anti-apoptotic protein as it inhibits apoptosome formation (Garrido et al. 2003) . CREB is also known to mediate a survival signal under various conditions (Tan et al. 1996; Ginty et al 1994; von Knethen et al. 1998) , and CREB is also phosphorylated in SARS-CoV-infected cells. The expression of SARS-N protein in transfected COS-1 cells induces phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, HSP-27, and CREB (Surjit et al. 2004) , whereas the viral-N protein expression system of vaccinia virus (DIs-N) does not induce phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Mizutani et al. 2006d ). Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway induces actin reorganization in COS-1 cells devoid of growth factors (Surjit et al. 2004) . Furthermore, the 7a protein of SARS-CoV induces apoptotic cell death and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in 293 T cells (Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2006 ). However, SB203580 does not prevent cell rounding, apoptosis, and chromatin condensation induced by the 7a protein. The differences in the results are most likely due to the use of different cell cultures and expression systems. Overall, phosphorylated proteins downstream of p38 MAPK have the potential to induce an anti-apoptotic environment in SARS-CoV-infected cells. However, activated p38 MAPK in SARS-CoV-infected cells is thought to be able to promote both cell death and survival. Perhaps there are other substrates of p38 MAPK that are inducible on cell death of Vero E6 cells caused by SARS-CoV infection, or perhaps there is cross-talk between the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and other signaling pathways inducing cell death. In Vero E6 cells, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 protein is constitutively phosphorylated at Tyr-705 and is slightly phosphorylated at Ser-727 (Mizutani et al. 2004a ). SARS-CoV infection is able to induce dephosphorylation of STAT3 Tyr-705 after 18 h.p.i. On the other hand, Ser-727-phosphorylated STAT3 is slightly increased at the same point in time. The activity of STAT transcription factors is induced by phosphorylation of a single tyrosine residue, leading to dimerization via an intermolecular SH2 phosphotyrosine interaction (Shuai et al. 1993 (Shuai et al. , 1994 Schindler et al. 1992a Schindler et al. , 1992b . STAT3 is known to be activated in response to interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10, and is thought to act as an anti-apoptotic transcription factor (Rajan and Mckay 1998; Grandis et al. 2000; Mora et al. 2002) . Tyr-705 phosphorylation of STAT is necessary for its activation (Shuai et al. 1993 (Shuai et al. , 1994 Schindler et al. 1992b) , suggesting that SARS-CoV infection leads to a decrease in STAT3 activation. Furthermore, STAT3 does not act as a transcriptional enhancer in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, as shown by the disappearance of Tyr-705-phosphorylated STAT3 from the nuclear fraction post SARS-CoV infection. The proteins upstream of STAT3 in the signaling pathway are Janus kinases (JAK1 and 2) and Tyk2, which are phosphorylated at low levels in mock-infected Vero E6 cells, even after virus infection. The signal transducing adaptor molecule 1 (STAM1), which is known to be associated with Jak2 and Jak3 via the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, is upregulated in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells (Leong et al. 2005) . Therefore, Tyr-705 dephosphorylation of STAT3 in virus-infected cells is independent of its upstream kinases, and there may be other signaling pathways regulating STAT3 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Two inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580 and SB202190) partially inhibit dephosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr-705, indicating that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is upstream of Tyr-705 dephosphorylation of STAT3 in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Inactivation of STAT3 via p38 MAPK activation may induce cell death in SARS-CoV-infected cells. However, the kinetics of STAT3 after SARS-CoV infection varies for different cell types. The suppressors of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) mRNA are suppressed in SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cells (Okabayashi et al. 2006) , leading to continuous activation of STAT3. A serine/threonine kinase, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), belongs to another signaling pathway, which is regulated by p38 MAPK. Generally, p90RSK is phosphorylated at Thr-573 by ERK (Gavin and Nebreda 1999; Smith et al. 1999) , and this phosphorylation induces autophosphorylation at Ser-380, and then PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) phosphorylates at Ser-221 (Frödin et al. 2000; Jensen et al. 1999; Richards et al. 1999) . No significant differences are observed in phosphorylation levels of p90RSK at Ser-221 and Thr-573 in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells (Mizutani et al. 2006a ). However, Ser-380 of p90RSK is phosphorylated in virus-infected confluent cells. Thus, phosphorylation of p90RSK Ser-380 is upregulated without upregulation of Thr-573 in SARS-CoVinfected cells. The phosphorylation of Ser-380 is decreased in SB203580-treated virus-infected cells, indicating that p38 MAPK can induce phosphorylation of Ser-380. Furthermore, p90RSK phosphorylates CREB . In SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, p38 MAPK activation induces phosphorylation of p90RSK Ser-380, and then CREB is thought to be phosphorylated by activated p90RSK. Thus, p90RSK may have anti-apoptotic activity in SARS-CoV-infected cells. The SARS-CoV S protein is able to induce phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in HEK293T cells (Liu et al. 2007 ). The S-induced protein kinase C (PKC)/ERK signaling pathway promotes nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) binding to the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) promoter. Similar results have been reported using the N protein of SARS-CoV (Yan et al. 2006 ). SARS-CoV S protein expression induces release of interleukin-8 (IL-8) via ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways including activator protein 1 (AP-1) in A549 cells ). On the contrary, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is downregulated in N protein-expressing COS-1 cells in the absence of serum (Surjit et al. 2004 ). Thus, viral proteins can potentially upor downregulate phosphorylation of ERK1/2. ERK1/2 is observed to be phosphorylated in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells (Mizutani et al. 2004a ). After treatment with MAPK/ERK kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2)-specific inhibitor (PD98059), SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells exhibit no significant changes in activated caspase-3 or caspase-7. Thus, activation of ERK1/2 is not sufficient to prevent cell death by SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, activation of ERK1/2 is not necessary to establish persistent infection of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells (Mizutani et al. 2005 ). The SARS-CoV S protein induces CREB binding to COX-2 promoter mediated via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/PKC/JNK pathway in HEK293T cells (Liu et al. 2007 ). Expression of the SARS-CoV N protein induces phosphorylation of JNK in Vero E6 cells (Mizutani et al. 2006d ) and in COS-1 cells in the absence of serum (Surjit et al. 2004 ). The phosphorylation level of Jun, which is dependent upon activation of JNK, also increases in the absence of serum. The SARS-CoV N protein can activate AP-1, which is composed of homodimers and heterodimers of Fos, Jun, CREB, and activating transcription factor (ATF) subunits, in Vero and Huh7 cells . The viral accessory proteins, 3a and 7a, phosphorylate JNK1 and JNK3 in HEK293T cells (Kanzawa et al. 2006) . Overall, viral proteins are able to induce phosphorylation of JNK in several cell lines. SARS-CoV infection induces phosphorylation of JNK in Vero E6 cells after at least 12 h.p.i. (Mizutani et al. 2004a ). The Vero E6 cells begin to show rounding at 24 h.p.i and persistently infected cells are observed after 48 h.p.i (Mizutani et al. 2005) . At this time, JNK, Akt, and p38 MAPK are phosphorylated in virus-infected cells. Treatment with an inhibitor of JNK (SP600125), and PI3K (LY294002), inhibits the establishment of persistence, whereas treatment with an inhibitor of MEK1/ 2 (PD98059) and p38 MAPK (SB203580) does not inhibit persistence of infection (Mizutani et al. 2005) . Thus, two different signaling pathways of JNK and PI3K/ Akt are important for the establishment of persistently infected Vero E6 cells (Mizutani et al. 2006d . Akt, which is also known as protein kinase B (PKB), is phosphorylated at both Ser-473 and Thr-308 residues via the PI3K signaling pathway upon stimulation by growth factors, insulin, and hormones (Toker 2000; Brazil and Hemmings 2001; Scheid and Woodgett 2003; Welch et al. 1998) . The main role of Akt is inhibition of apoptosis via phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor (FKHR) family, glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b), caspase-9, and Bcl-associated death protein (Bad) (Cardone et al. 1998; Cross et al. 1995; Datta et al. 1997) . Interestingly, GSK-3 regulates phosphorylation of N protein (Wu et al. 2009 ). The M protein of SARS-CoV induces apoptosis in both HEK293T cells and transgenic Drosophila ). The M protein-induced apoptosis involves mitochondrial release of cytochrome c protein. In SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, Ser-473 of Akt is phosphorylated at 8 h.p.i. and maximal phosphorylation is observed at 18 h.p.i. (Mizutani et al. 2004b) , after which Akt is dephosphorylated. Thr-308 phosphorylation has not been detected in Vero E6 cells. The phosphorylation of Ser-473 of Akt by viral infection is inhibited by LY294002, which is an inhibitor of the PI3K signaling pathway. An in vitro kinase activity assay of Akt in SARS-CoV-infected cells indicated that Akt is highly phosphorylated only at serine residues, but Akt activity is low. Therefore, weak activation of Akt cannot prevent apoptosis induced by SARS-CoV infection in Vero E6 cells. The phosphorylation of Akt in virusinfected cells is necessary to establish persistence, but Akt is not phosphorylated after establishing persistent cell lines (Mizutani et al. 2005 (Mizutani et al. , 2006d , suggesting that activation of PI3K/Akt is essential for the establishment of persistent infection with SARS-CoV at points in time before cell death. The above characterizations of Akt in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells are mainly derived from experiments using confluent cells. When subconfluent Vero E6 cells are infected by SARS-CoV, cell proliferation is inhibited (Mizutani et al. 2006c ). SARS-CoV infection induces dephosphorylation of a serine residue of Akt without phosphorylation in subconfluent cultures. Thus, downregulation of Akt activity in SARS-CoV-infected cells prevents cell proliferation. The SARS-CoV N protein is able to activate NF-kB in Vero E6 cells (Liao et al. 2005 ). As described above, the S-and N-induced PKC/ERK signaling pathway promotes NF-kB binding to the COX-2 promoter (Liu et al. 2007; Yan et al. 2006) . SARS-CoV S and N proteins may cause inflammation of the lungs by activating COX-2 gene expression. The 3a and 7a viral accessory proteins enhance NF-kB mediated transcription in HEK293T cells (Kanzawa et al. 2006) . In contrast, the N protein inhibits interferon production in 293 T cells via inhibition of NF-kB (Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2007 ). The M protein also suppresses NF-kB activity (Fang et al. 2007) . Growth arrest and apoptosis via caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities are induced in SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CL pro )-expressing human promonocyte HL-CZ cell line (Lin et al. 2006) . The SARS-CoV 3CL pro may increase activation of NF-kB and upregulate cytochrome c oxidase and downregulate Hsp-70, inducing mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis (Lai et al. 2007 ). Viral papain-like protease (PLP) regulates antagonism of IRF3 and NF-kB signaling pathways (Frieman et al. 2009 ). The 3a protein of SARS-CoV has the potential to inhibit cell cycle progression at the G 1 phase in HEK293, COS-7, and Vero cells (Yuan et al. 2005 (Yuan et al. , 2007 . The C-terminal region of the 3a protein, which includes a potential ATPase motif, is essential to inhibit the cell cycle. The 3a protein expression reduces cyclin D3 level and inhibits retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation. The p53 phosphorylation is increased by 3a expression. The 7a protein expression also blocks cell cycle progression at the G 0 /G 1 phase in HEK293, COS-7, and Vero cells by mechanisms similar to those of the 3a protein (Yuan et al. 2006) . The N protein is a substrate of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) as well as GSK, MAPK, and casein kinase II (Surjit et al. 2005) . The N protein directly binds to cyclin D and inhibits activity of the cyclin D-CDK4 complex. The N protein also inhibits CDK2 activity by direct binding to the CDK2-cyclin complex, resulting in blocking the S phase progression in COS-7 and Huh7 cells (Surjit et al. 2006) . Therefore, proteins of SARS-CoV may have the ability to inhibit the progression of the host cell cycle, but further detailed analysis is required in SARS-CoV-infected cells. SARS-CoV infection induces apoptotic cell death in Vero E6 cells, via dephosphorylation of STAT3 by p38 MAPK activation, and inactivation of Akt, as previously described. Recent study suggest that SARS-CoV triggers apoptosis via protein kinase R (PKR) (Krähling et al. 2009 ). Overexpression of SARS-CoV proteins can induce apoptosis in variable cell lines. Induction of apoptosis by various viral proteins may occur at different stages of the infection cycle. SARS-CoV 3CL pro expression in HL-CZ cells induces apoptosis via caspase-3 and caspase-9 (Lin et al. 2006) . Furthermore, 3CL pro expression in HL-CZ cells upregulates proteins located in the mitochondria, but downregulates Hsp-70, which antagonizes apoptosis-inducing factor (Lai et al. 2007 ). The SARS-CoV 8a protein, localized in the mitochondria of infected cells, increases mitochondrial transmembrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, and caspase-3 activation, resulting in inducing apoptosis in Vero, HEK293, and Huh7 cells ). ORF 6 induces apoptosis via caspase-3 mediated, ER stress and JNKdependent pathways (Ye et al. 2008 ). SARS-CoV N protein modulates the TGF-b signaling pathway to block apoptosis of SARS-CoV-infected host cells (Zhao et al. 2008) . In the absence of serum, the SARS-CoV N protein can induce apoptosis by activating the mitochondrial pathway , and/or by downregulating ERK and Akt signaling pathways (Surjit et al. 2004) in COS-1 cells, but not in Hep-G2 and Huh-7 cells ). The SARS-CoV S protein and its C-terminal domain (S2) induce apoptosis in Vero E6 cells, but the S1, E, M, and N proteins are not able to induce apoptosis in Vero E6 cells . In contrast, the SARS-CoV M and N proteins can induce apoptosis in human pulmonary fibroblast (HPF) cells . The M protein induces apoptosis through modulation of the Akt pathway and mitochondrial cytochrome c release in HEK293T cells and transgenic Drosophila [85]. Overexpression of SARS-CoV 3a protein in Vero E6 cells induces apoptosis, mediated through a caspase-8-dependent pathway or p38 MAPK Waye et al. 2005; Padhan et al. 2008) . The 3a protein expression in Drosophila induces apoptosis, which could be modulated by cellular cytochrome c levels and caspase activity . The SARS-CoV 3b protein induces both necrosis and apoptosis in Vero E6 cells (Khan et al. 2006) . The SARS-CoV 7a protein interacts with pro-survival proteins, basal cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-w, A1, and myeloid cell leukaemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), at the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria, resulting in triggering apoptosis in HEK293T and Vero E6 cells (Tan et al. 2007 ). Interestingly, the 7a protein does not interact with the pro-apoptotic members, Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), Bcl-2 homologous killer (Bak), Bad, and Bcl-2 interacting domain (Bid). However, a mutant virus without the 7a/7b gene is able to induce extensive CPEs in the Vero cell line (Yount et al. 2005) , suggesting that the 7a protein is not a dominant contributor to virus-induced cell death in this cell culture system. The SARS-CoV N protein downregulates the level of Bcl-2 in COS-1 cells (Surjit et al. 2004 ). The SARS-CoV E protein induces apoptosis in Jurkat T cells in the absence of growth factors, but apoptosis is inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-xL via interaction with the E protein . Apoptosis is also inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2 in SARS-CoVinfected Vero cells (Bordi et al. 2006 ). In the virus-infected Vero cells, downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax are observed (Ren et al. 2005) . Bcl-xL activation plays important roles in establishing persistent infection of SARS-CoV (Mizutani et al. 2006b) . The N protein upregulates the Bcl-xL protein level (Mizutani et al. 2006d ). These reports indicate that Bcl-xL activation is the key to preventing apoptosis due to SARS-CoV infection. The other viral proteins localized in the mitochondria of infected cells may also interact with Bcl-xL and other prosurvival proteins. Western blots are used to analyze signaling pathway proteins of cultured cells infected with SARS-CoV or transfected with plasmids encoding viral proteins. Thus, the kinetics of phosphor-proteins regulating signaling pathways is important for understanding which signaling pathways are activated in virus-infected cells. However, in vivo analysis and amounts of mRNA from whole blood or tissues of SARS patients are primarily analyzed using DNA microarrays. Unfortunately, when the level of mRNA related to a signaling pathway increases in SARS patients, as measured by DNA microarray analysis, the results do not suggest activation of particular signaling pathways, due to the analysis being performed on a mixed population of cells. The roles of signaling pathways may be different amongst different cell types. Analyses of signaling pathways in virus-infected patients are still difficult to perform for these reasons. However, flow cytometric analysis of cell samples from virus-infected patients provides an improved method for the investigation of signaling pathways in vivo. Flow cytometric analysis of phospho-p38 indicated that augmented p38 MAPK phosphorylation of CD14 monocytes was associated with suppressed p38 MAPK phosphorylation of CD8 lymphocytes, suggesting that altered leukocyte p38 activation contributes to abnormal blood cytokine profiles in SARS patients ). Analysis of cell apoptosis in SARS patients is key to understanding the signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis. In SARS patients, lymphopenia caused by depletion of T lymphocytes by apoptosis is a common abnormality ). Compared to healthy controls, SARS patients have significantly lower lymphocyte and platelet counts and have significantly higher vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) levels and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) levels, as determined using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). SARS patients also have intracellular activated caspase-3 fragment levels, as measured using flow cytometry (Peiris et al. 2003b) . Liver impairment commonly occurs amongst patients with SARS, indicating that SARS-CoV may be localized in the liver (Chau et al. 2004 ). The pathologic features, perhaps due to apoptosis, are the presence of acidophilic bodies, ballooning of hepatocytes, and mild to moderate lobular activities. The thyroid glands of SARS-infected patients show extensive injury due to apoptosis of the follicular epithelial cells and the parafollicular cells, as measured using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assay . Necrosis is also observed in splenic lymphoid tissue and lymph nodes of SARS patients (Ding et al. 2003) . MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung in BALB/c mice may be required for protection from lethal recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV infection (Sheahan et al. 2008) . Further detailed analysis of apoptosis in cells of SARS patients is required, but the initial reports indicate the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways in SARS patients.@story_separate@Both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival signaling pathways are activated in SARS-CoV-infected cells (Fig. 19.2) . The balance of activities of signaling pathways is important for determination of cell death or cell survival. In SARS patients, analysis of signaling pathways is further complicated because many cell types respond to viral infection. For example, immune cells infected by SARS-CoV produce and release cytokines, and the cytokines activate other cells. Thus, in SARS patients, many types of cells are infected by SARS-CoV, compared with one type of cell used for in vitro experiments. In addition, the viral proteins that interact with cellular proteins in signaling pathways must be further clarified to understand the It is particularly important to determine the viral proteins that are necessary and sufficient to fully activate signaling pathways leading to apoptotic cell death. Determining the SARS-CoVinduced signaling pathways in SARS patients will enable the development of therapeutic reagents that can inhibit the pathways of apoptotic cell death and production of cytokines.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory illness with variable symptoms that was recognized as the first near-pandemic infectious disease of the twenty-first century. A novel human coronavirus, named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), derived from SARS patients was reported as the etiologic agent of SARS. Studying the signaling pathways of SARS-infected cells is key to understanding the molecular mechanism of SARS viral infection. Cell death is observed in cultured Vero E6 cells after SARS-CoV infection. From SARS-CoV infection to cell death, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a key participant in the determination of cell death and survival. Two signaling pathways comprising signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) are downstream of p38 MAPK. AKT and JNK (Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase) signaling pathways are important to establish persistent infection of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. Expression studies of SARS-CoV proteins indicate that the viral proteins are able to activate signaling pathways of host cells. The study of signaling pathways in SARS-CoV patients is difficult to perform compared with in vitro studies due to the effects of the human immune system. This review highlights recent progress in characterizing signal transduction pathways in SARS-CoV-infected cells in vitro and in vivo."
"Agriculture plays a fundamental role in human history. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, agriculture was the major economic activity and enabled the human population to grow. As a result, agricultural growth has been regarded as an essential condition, or even a precondition, for the rise of human civilization. Although the share of agriculture in total GDP kept decreasing, agriculture is still important after the Industrial Revolution. On the one hand, agriculture remains a vital and unique instrument for achieving poverty alleviation, especially in the rural areas (Thirtle et al. 2003; World Bank 2007; Chen and Gong 2021) . On the other hand, agriculture has significant impacts on industrialization, urbanization, and the long-term evolution of the economy (Ashraf and Galor 2011; Carillo 2018) . Some scholars (e.g., Lewis (1954) , Ranis and Fei (1961) , Foster and Rosenzweig (1996) , Bustos et al. (2016) , and Schmidt et al. (2018) ) believe that higher agricultural productivity can enhance human capital accumulation, reallocate labor and other resource towards the industrial sector, and therefore stimulate the process of economic development. Other scholars (e.g., Matsuyama (1992) , Foster and Rosenzweig (2004) , Galor and Mountford (2008) ), however, highlight that agricultural productivity growth may foster the comparative advantage of the agricultural sector, limit human capital formation, and hinder industrialization, especially in an open economy. To summarize, agriculture has always been a key determinant of economic growth. To investigate the relationship between changes in agricultural productivity and long-run economic growth (in both agricultural and industrial sector), accurate estimation of agricultural productivity is necessary and therefore has been the subject of intensive research since the 1950s (Coelli and Rao 2005) . Ruttan (2002) divides the comparative research on agricultural productivity growth into three stages. In the first two stages, efforts were directed towards measuring the single/partial factor productivity and then total factor productivity (TFP) (e.g., Kögel and Prskawetz (2001) , Jin et al. (2002) , O' Rourke and Williamson (2005) , Strulik and Weisdorf (2008) , Deininger (2009), Vollrath (2011) , Yu (2012) , and ), whereas agricultural convergence tests in productivity and efficiency are the core of the third and current stage. Examining the evidence and rate that agricultural productivity is converging across countries is an issue of enduring interest, and for good reason: It indicates whether poor countries are catching up with rich countries (Henderson and Russell 2005) and clarifies the conditions under which nations benefit from an ""backwardness advantage"" to help design relevant development policies (Inklaar and Diewert 2016) . Moreover, it can reflect the changes in comparative advantages of agriculture across countries and hence affect the structural transformation as well as the demographic transition. The frontier productivity approach, including stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA), is the most frequently used method in this line of research (Ruttan 2002; Coelli and Rao 2005) . Compared with the classic production function method, this frontier approach allows for the further decomposition of productivity growth into shifts in the world frontier as well as changes in technical efficiency (Alene and Coulibaly 2009) . In a seminal work of Kumar and Russell (2002) , technical efficiency improvement is labeled as a technological catchup and indicates convergence, since it measures countries' movements toward the best global practice, or production frontier. Some studies (e.g., Coelli and Rao (2005) and Rezitis (2010)) on agricultural productivity have employed the DEA approach to measure agricultural TFP/efficiency and test agricultural convergence. However, recent studies have found that agricultural productivity estimates using the DEA method often yields anomalous results (Headey et al. 2010) . Nin et al. (2003) find that DEA-based TFP estimates typically lead to very different results when compared with those generated by every other measure of agricultural development, because DEA fails to distinguish productivity from measurement error and white noise. Different from many other industries, white noise and measurement error are significant challenges and problems in agricultural productivity analysis. On the one hand, agriculture is sensitive to and severely affected by certain difficult-to-observe shocks (e.g., changes in policies and prices, diseases and pests, as well as rainfall and temperature). On the other hand, agricultural data from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the main data sources for this line of study, can be deeply flawed, especially for small and poor nations without adequate capacity for statistical collection (Headey et al. 2010) . Neither of these problems can be fully addressed in DEA, as it is a deterministic approach. Stochastic frontier analysis, however, can capture measurement error and white noises in the disturbance, and therefore rules them out from the productivity estimates. Using both the DEA and SFA approaches on FAO data, Coelli et al. (2004) and Headey et al. (2010) find that SFA results are considerably more stable and credible than DEA results. However, most of these SFA studies (e.g., Kumbhakar and Wang (2005) , Deliktas and Balcilar (2005) , and Headey et al. (2010) ) use the Battese and Coelli estimator (BC, hereafter) , which is proposed by Battese and Coelli (1992) and has a similar monotonicity restriction on technical efficiency for all countries. As a result, BC92 fails to reflect the non-monotonic fluctuation in efficiencies across countries and over time. For example, the Green Revolution was introduced to various countries in different periods and the achievements in agricultural catch-up differed across countries and over time. In recent years, many new SFA models (e.g., Greene (2005) , Greene (2008) , Wang and Ho (2010) , Kneip et al. (2012) , and Kumbhakar et al. (2014) ) are constantly developed to allow more flexible trend of efficiencies. To our knowledge, however, less effort has been made to apply these new models to test world convergence in agricultural efficiency. Therefore, the first puzzle is to find appropriate SFA estimators that can better capture the heterogeneity in country-level efficiency trend of agriculture. Once the technical efficiencies are estimated, the next question is how to investigate convergence. Existing convergence tests include σ-convergence test, unconditional βconvergence test and conditional β-convergence test (Cameron et al. 2005; Madsen 2007; Ruan et al. 2008; Inklaar and Diewert 2016) . Moreover, the degrees of convergence in different regions and different groups of countries are of great importance. Finally, how to improve technical efficiency and hence accelerate the speed of convergence is also a question of enduring interest in development economics. This article aims to answer all of the questions mentioned above, especially those related to estimating accurate technical efficiency and investigating whether agricultural convergence occurs. Firstly, a Jackknife model averaging method is applied in this article, which can consider both a parametric and a semi-parametric SFA model to better estimate technical efficiency. Then, the aforementioned convergence tests are employed to determine whether world agricultural catch-up occurred as well as the degree of convergence among different groups of countries. It is worth noting that efficiency convergence only indicates that countries in the same group are becoming closer and closer, which can be either ""good"" or ""bad"". 1 Similarly, efficiency divergence only indicates that countries in the same group are becoming more dispersed, which can also be ""good"" or ""bad"". Therefore, this article further investigates the heterogeneity in efficiency convergence and divergence, respectively. Finally, this article analyzes potential methods to improve agricultural efficiency and diminish the productivity gap among different groups of countries. This study mainly contributes to the literature on agricultural convergence in three ways: (1) it tests not only the world agricultural convergence, but also the situations in different groups of countries; (2) it further analyzes how to accelerate technological catch-up in different countries and finds that the different major driving forces to achieve convergence within rich countries and poor countries; and (3) compared with existing efficiency convergence analyses, it further estimates technological progress to investigate the heterogeneity in efficiency convergence and divergence, respectively. Utilizing a balanced panel of 126 countries from 1970-2014, the empirical results show that world agricultural convergence has not occurred. This article then investigates the situations in different groups of countries and discusses how to use international trade, irrigation system, and structural transformation to improve agricultural efficiency and to diminish the efficiency gap among different countries in the future. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 establishes the model, Section 3 provides data description, Section 4 presents the empirical results and makes some discussions, and Section 5 concludes the paper.@story_separate@This section begins with an introduction to stochastic frontier model and how different models can be combined to estimate efficiency. Then three types of convergence tests are established to measure agricultural efficiency convergence. Finally, endogeneity problems are discussed. Productivity This article adopts stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to estimate technical efficiency, which has been used in some studies (e.g., Jin et al. 2010 , Wang et al. 2016 , Ma et al. 2019 , and Gong and Sickles 2020 to measure the productivity gap. It is worth noting that the DEA also has its own advantages, as it does not need to impose assumptions of parametric functional forms and distributional assumptions on random noise and inefficiency as in the SFA. However, measurement errors may be pertinent in the USDA-ERS dataset (Alston and Pardey 2014) , which is employed in this article. Since flexibility is less important than measurement errors in this particular application, we choose to use the SFA. The classic SFA model with the Cobb-Douglas formation was first proposed by Aigner et al. (1977) and Meeusen and Van den Broeck (1977) , then developed by Schmidt and Sickles (1984) under a panel data setting, where y it is the output of country i at time t in logarithms, and x k i measures the k-th input of country i at time t in logarithms. it describes the production frontier. u i is a non-negative random term that indicates the vertical distance of country i production to the frontier, and hence the gap with the ""best practice"" level identified by the most productive country. Technical efficiency can be derived by TE i = exp(−u i ), which ranges from 0 to 100%. v i is the typical disturbance. It is worth noting that the technical efficiency term, u i , is assumed to be time-invariant in Eq. (1). Therefore, α i can be modeled by the fixed effects or random effects methods. However, the technical efficiency of a country may change over time, as will the debate of convergence and divergence. Moreover, some scholars (e.g., Kumbhakar and Wang (2005) , Headey et al. (2010) , Inklaar and Diewert (2016), and Zhang et al. (2020) ) believe that the Transcendental Logarithmic (T-L) specification for the production function fits data better than the Cobb-Douglas (C-D) specification, as it provides suitable second-order approximations. Accordingly, a stochastic frontier model in T-L specification and time-variant technical efficiency has the form: where α it = α t − u it measures total factor productivity in logarithms, which is determined by both the frontier α t and the efficiency u it . Moreover, the productivity growth, Δα it , can be decomposed into technological change (shifts in the production frontier, or notionally, Δα t ) and efficiency change 1 A ""good"" convergence occurs when the leading countries experience normal or fast technological progress whereas the lagging countries grow even very fast. A ""bad"" convergence occurs, on the other hand, when the lagging countries grow slowly but the leading countries grow slower or even experience stagnation. (distance to the frontier, also known as technological catchup, or notionally, Δu it ) (Henderson and Russell 2005) . A new wave of studies (e.g., Cornwell et al. (1990) , Kumbhakar (1990) , Battese and Coelli (1992) , Lee and Schmidt (1993) , Kneip et al. (2003) , and Sickles (2005)) have developed various models to estimate the time-variant efficiency in the 1990s and 2000s. Shang (2015) and Gong (2020a) introduce a number of competing approaches and compares them under different settings. One of the most popular time-variant estimators is the BC estimator established by Battese and Coelli (1992) , where u it =exp(−η(t − T))·u i and u i $ N þ ðμ; σ 2 μ Þ is a truncated normal distribution. Under this assumption, Eq. (2) can be solved by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Most existing SFA studies, such as Deliktas and Balcilar (2005) , Kumbhakar and Wang (2005) , and Headey et al. (2010) , adopted the BC estimator to investigate economic convergence or technological catch-up. The BC estimator has a monotonicity restriction on technical efficiency. Moreover, this monotonic trend has a constant growth rate and is the same for all of the countries, as η is time-invariant and country-invariant. If η is negative, then technical efficiency is decreasing over time for all countries, therefore leading to a conclusion of economic divergence. The case in which ηis positive implies that all countries are getting closer to the frontier over time and therefore suggests economic convergences to a single TFP level (σ-convergence). A zero η indicates that technical efficiency is time invariant, which implies that the gaps across countries do not change over time. However, the assumption of time-invariant and countryinvariant growth rates in efficiency that is held by the BC estimator is unrealistic. Aside from the example of the Green Revolution in the previous section, less efficient countries can replicate the production methods, technologies and institutions of efficient and frontier countries. This catch-up effect can be realized through international trade and irrigation investment. International trade makes the new production methods and technologies accessible to less efficient countries, whereas establishing irrigation systems and cultivating new cropland can improve agricultural productivity. Moreover, structural transformation may also affect technical efficiency, since the TFPs for crop production and livestock production are different. Since the efficiency determinants, including international trade, irrigation investment, and structural transformation, change across countries and over time, so does technical efficiency. This article aims to investigate the efficiency changes in agriculture over the period of 1970-2014, during which both the macro and micro environments changed dramatically. For example, the Green Revolution helped many poor countries produce more food and generated catch-up effects. Some less developed countries, such as China, achieved remarkable agricultural growth as a result of several waves of institutional reforms and market deregulations. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the 1990s provided more opportunities for international trade and global cooperation. The BC estimator fails to capture both the changing macro environment and countrylevel factors due to its rigid assumption of the time-invariant and country-invariant efficiency trend. Therefore, this article employs two other stochastic frontier methods that are more flexible in order to capture the time-variant and country-variant efficiency trend. The first stochastic frontier model, the Cornwell-Schmidt-Sickles (CSS) estimator, is proposed by Cornwell et al. (1990) , which has a quadratic time-variant intercept of each country based on Eq. (2) where the quadratic equation of time captures the non-linear trend of efficiency over time, and the country-specific parameters θ i1 − θ i3 capture the heterogeneity in the efficiency trend across countries. The CSS model is derived by a Generalized Least Squares (GLS) estimator. The second stochastic frontier model, the Kneip-Sickles-Song (KSS) model, is proposed by Kneip et al. (2012) who believe that country-level efficiencies are affected by some time-variant variables and therefore model efficiencies through a linear combination of some basis functions. Mathematically, the KSS approach models the individual effects in Eq. (2) have the form where the basis functions consist of g 1 (t), …, g L (t), and θ i1 , …, θ iL are the corresponding country-specific parameters. As a semi-parametric model, KSS relaxes some rigid formation assumption in the parametric models, such as BC and CSS. Moreover, KSS can be regarded as a generalized model that nests both the BC and CSS estimators. More specifically, if L = 3 and the polynomial functions are the basis functions, the CSS model is a special case of the KSS model, whereas the BC model is nested in the KSS model if L = 1 and There are both advantages and disadvantages to the CSS model and the KSS model. The CSS model is more computationally friendly, but relies heavily on the rigid quadratic formation assumption. The KSS model, however, relaxes the formation assumption to capture a more general functional form of the efficiency trend, but may encounter computational challenges. Therefore, the CSS estimator is preferred if the true data generating process (DGP) of efficiency approximates to the quadratic formation; otherwise, it is likely to underperform the KSS estimator. However, the true DGP is unobserved and varies case by case, which makes it necessary to find an optimal approach to better use these estimators. One popular approach is to use some model selection criterion to choose either CSS or KSS models, such as adjusted R 2 , Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). However, a small variation in data might result in different selection of the ""best"" model under the same criterion if the criterion scores happen to be close across models, not to mention the different results due to varying selection of the criteria. Moreover, more than one candidate model may partially capture the underlying DGP (Shang 2015) . In terms of global agricultural production, some countries may have a quadratic trend of productivity growth, whereas other countries may not. The CSS estimator is preferred for the first group of countries and the KSS estimator is preferred for the second group of countries. Finally, the trend of productivity growth for the same countries may also vary over time, and therefore CSS and KSS estimators should be utilized for different periods. Considering the complexity of the true DGP in crosscountry agricultural production during such a long sample period, we need to find an alternative approach that allows the joint utilization of different candidate models. This article therefore adopts a model averaging method to assign weights to each candidate model based on the model's ability to explain the sample data (Balcombe and Rapsomanikis 2010; Cho and Kasa 2017) . If one candidate model dominates in describing the true DGP and approximating the underlying mechanism, model averaging methods can then assign all the weights to that model during model selection. Therefore, model selection is a special case of model averaging. Another advantage of model averaging is the robustness of the estimation results. As has been mentioned, a slight change in data or a different use of criteria may cause a different model selection and very different estimation results. However, such changes have limited effects on the weights assigned to various candidate models and therefore cause limited variation in the estimation results. Various model averaging methods are applied in the literature. The information criteria-based method assigns weights to candidate models based on information criteria (Buckland et al. 1997; Gong 2018b ), such as AIC or BIC. However, the effectiveness and quality improvement are difficult to test. With this concern in mind, a jackknife model averaging (JMA) method, proposed by Hansen and Racine (2012) , assigns weights based on a ""leave one out"" cross-validation criterion. The JMA method is adopted in this article, as it is asymptotically optimal and approaches the minimum expected square errors as the sample size is close to infinity. More specifically, JMA is employed in this article to assign weights to the CSS and KSS models as it best fits the data. Let us denote the jackknife estimates as i measure the fitted value of country i's production utilizing the KSS and CSS methods, respectively, after the observations of the ith country are removed. The jackknife weight w * of CSS model is obtained by minimizing the cross-validation As a result, the jackknife model averaging CSS & KSS stochastic frontier model is where y CSS it represents the CSS estimator based on Eqs. (2) and (3), and y KSS it represents KSS estimator based on Eqs. (2) and (4). The overall technical efficiency is the jackknifeweighted averages of the CSS and KSS estimators: To assess the degree of convergence, this article considers three measures. The first method is the σ-convergence, which measures the cross-sectional dispersion of efficiency changes and has been widely used in existing studies (e.g., Lichtenberg (1994) , McCunn and Huffman (2000) , and Rezitis (2010)). σ-convergence implies the extent to which productivity and efficiency levels are becoming more similar over time. To test for σ-convergence, consider the regression equation where var(lnTE) t is the variance of technical efficiency for all countries at time t in logarithms, which is computed by Þ is the average level of efficiency in logarithms. The sufficient condition for σ-convergence is that ϕ 2 is significantly negative, which implies the convergence to the frontier for all countries over time. Otherwise, the unconditional σ-convergence does not happen. Furthermore, when the test rejects unconditional σ-convergence, it can then be employed to subgroups of countries (e.g., McCunn and Huffman (2000)) or to sub-periods (e.g., Rezitis (2010) ), which extends a test of convergence across all countries within a group or during a subperiod. The second method is the unconditional β-convergence, which occurs when less efficient countries grow faster than more efficient ones. Following Sala-i-Martin (1996) and Young et al. (2008) , an unconditional β-convergence equation is proposed of the form in this article where TE i,t−1 is the technical efficiency in the previous period and ΔTE it = 100 * (TE it − TE i,t−1 ) measures the percentage change in efficiency for country i at time t. When ϕ 2 is statistically significant negative, it implies that less efficient countries grow faster. The third method is the conditional β-convergence, which implies possible channels through which convergence can be achieved or accelerated in the future. A conditional β-convergence occurs when countries experience β-convergence that is conditional on other variables (i.e., the state of each country). This article establishes a conditional β-convergence equation of the form where Z is a vector of variables that may affect agricultural technical efficiency, which includes the total volume of international trade (trade), proportion of cropland to total agricultural land (cropland), proportion of agricultural land that is irrigated (irrig), and the output ratio of livestock in total products (livestock). A conditional β-convergence is accepted if ϕ 2 in Eq. (9) is negative and significantly different from zero. Some scholars (e.g., Raiser (1998) and McCunn and Huffman (2000)) replace previous period efficiency lnTE i,t−1 with lnTE i,t0 in the β-convergence equation to measure the initial level of efficiency and therefore define less efficient and more efficient countries. This revision may not work well for studying agricultural convergence, as it relies heavily on the first year of the sample period. Agricultural production suffers from great risk and uncertainty, which leads to frequent fluctuation in productivity and efficiency, especially for small and poor countries. As a result, a different selection of the initial period may cause very different results. Since the dependent variable ΔTE it is in the range 0-100, this article uses a Tobit model to solve Eqs. (7) and (8). Moreover, this article follows Kumbhakar et al. (2015) to correct the standard errors using the bootstrap method. This article uses the aforementioned measures (σ-convergence, unconditional β-convergence, and conditional βconvergence) to test agricultural convergence for 126 countries during the period from 1970-2014. Moreover, this article tests the σ-convergence and β-convergence for various groups that may share the same steady state, in addition to the test of the whole world: (1) Since geographic condition is time invariant and highly related to the initial conditions of the countries, this article tests agricultural convergence in different regions. 2 (2) Bartkowska and Riedl (2012) point out that the initial condition of per capita income plays a crucial role in determining convergence groups. This article also tests the convergence for low-income, lower middle-income, upper middle-income, and high-income countries, as countries in each of the four groups are likely to have a similar initial level of per capita income. (3) Another popular classification of countries is less developed countries (LDCs) and developed countries (DCs), which not only reflects the difference in income level, but also many other development factors that may lead countries to different steady states. Therefore, the third set of convergence tests is for DCs and LDCs separately. (4) International trade enhances the speed of technology transfer (Cameron et al. 2005 ) and therefore affects convergence. As a result, it may be easier to achieve convergence in GATT/WTO member countries. This article therefore tests agricultural catch-up for GATT/WTO member countries and non-member countries. (5) An alternative classification of developing countries that not only considers development level, but focuses on agricultural development level, is proposed in the World Development Report 2008: Agriculture for Development by World Bank (World Bank, 2007) , which indicates that agriculture operates in three different worlds: agriculture-based, transforming and urbanized countries 3 . This article also tests if convergence occurs within each of these three groups in addition to developed countries. The stochastic frontier model may experience an endogeneity problem because some productivity information considered in the decision-making process of production is unobservable by scholars (Ackerberg et al. 2015; Gong and Sickles 2021) . Amsler et al. (2016) introduce a way to solve endogeneity in stochatic frontier models. Following their approach, this article tests the endogeneity of each input by employing a control function method and correct the bias if necessary. Lagged values of inputs are employed to serve as instruments, which is recommended in Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) , Guan et al. (2009), and Gong (2018a) . An endogeneity problem may also occur in the conditional β-convergence function in Eq. (9), since international trade may affect technical efficiency and thus lead to a reverse causation issue. The instrument variable (IV) method is usually employed to solve this bias. This article uses per capita agricultural production (agri_pc it ) and per capita arable land (land_pc it ) as instruments for international trade, which is suggested in Chanda and Dalgaard (2008) and Madsen (2009) . Moreover, the delayed value of international trade can also mitigate the causality problem. Moreover, USDA-ERS also reports the proportion of cropland to total agricultural land (cropland it ) as well as the proportion of agricultural land that is irrigated (irrig it ) and separates countries into eight geographical regions and four income classes as mentioned in Section 2.3. Data for the total volume of international trade in agricultural products (trade it ) are collected from the NBER-UN database for 1970-1994 and the CEPII-BACI database for 1995-2014. 5 The output share of livestock in total agricultural products (livestock it ) is collected and calculated from FAO's database. The list of GATT/WTO members is available on the WTO website, 6 whereas the list of developed countries is from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Population size (pop it ) is collected from World Bank databases. Finally, per capita arable land (land_pc it ) and per capita agricultural production (agri_pc it ) are calculated using population data from World Bank databases and agricultural output and land data from USDA-ERS. Combining all the data mentioned above, this article is based on a balanced panel of 126 countries from 1970-2014. These countries account for roughly 86% of the world's total population and 82% of the world's total agricultural production in 1970, whereas these two figures increased to 89 and 90%, respectively, by 2014. Table 1 presents the distribution of these countries under various classifications in 2014. Under geographic classification, countries in America, Europe and Oceania have abundant agricultural products as their shares of agricultural products are higher than their shares of population, whereas low per capita agricultural output and shortages of food mainly occurred in Sub-Saharan African countries as they account for 11.2% of global population, but only produce 5.5% of the world's agricultural output. In terms of income levels, low-income and lower middle-income countries, on average, have per capita agricultural outputs that are significantly and slightly lower than the world average, respectively, whereas high-income and upper middleincome countries on average have per capita agricultural outputs that are significantly and slightly higher than world average, respectively. Therefore, income level also seems like a valid standard to classify countries into different groups that may have different conditions in agriculture. The same conclusion applies to development groups, trade groups and agricultural groups, as various groups under each of the three classifications have a significantly different per capita agricultural output. More specifically, developed countries, GATT/WTO members, and urbanized countries on average have better agricultural conditions than less developed countries, non-GATT/WTO members, and agriculture-based countries, respectively. In summary, significant differences in agriculture across groups are observed under all five classifications. Therefore, convergence tests are also applied within each group under these classifications. Table 2 provides summary statistics of the key variables. These 126 countries on average generated agricultural products worth 10.3 billion international dollars at 2005's constant price. Roughly 60% of the agricultural outputs are crops and 40% are livestock-related products. In terms of agricultural inputs, these countries on average use a 7.0 million-strong labor force, 15.1 thousand cattle equivalents of livestock capital, 0.2 million tractor equivalents of farm machinery, 0.8 million metric tons of fertilizer, and 6.7 million metric tons of feed, in addition to utilizing 13.3 million hectares of agricultural land, where 79% is cropland and 12% is equipped for irrigation. Moreover, the average volume of international trade is 5.9 billion dollars. Finally, the average per capita amount of arable land is 0.44 hectare, and the average per capita agricultural products are valued at 310 international dollars at 2005's constant price. Table 3 reports the estimation results of various SFA models. The first and second columns show the results of the CSS and KSS models, respectively. The jackknife weight assigned to the CSS model is 0.489, whereas the weight assigned to the KSS model is 0.511, which shows that both models can partially capture the true DGP, but the semi-parametric KSS weighs more. Column 3 of Table 3 reports the estimation result of the model averaging CSS & KSS stochastic frontier model using the jackknife weights reported in the first two columns. Based on Column 3, labor elasticity and livestock elasticity are the greatest, followed by the elasticity of land and feed, whereas the elasticity of machinery and fertilizer are the lowest. Using the estimations in Table 3 , this article calculates the output elasticity with respect to each input across models: (1) Table 4 presents country-level technical efficiency estimated by the CSS, KSS, and jackknife averaging CSS & KSS models. The average efficiency level of agricultural production is 35%, which implies great potential to increase agricultural output. Even without technical progress, the global agricultural output can almost triple if all countries can achieve the highest attainable productivity on the frontier through efficiency improvement, which could significantly contribute to sustainable development and poverty reduction. Moreover, the distribution of technical efficiency is right skewed as more than three-quarters of the countries are less than half as efficient as the frontier countries. One-quarter of these 126 countries have an efficiency level of less than 21%; these are the least developed countries with severe hunger and poverty. All of these facts provide evidence of the great importance of agricultural convergence if technological catch-up occurred in those The last two columns give mean and median value of agricultural output in billion international dollars at 2005 constant price, respectively least efficient countries. Otherwise, the world will face more challenges between the growing population and food scarcity if agricultural divergence is observed. Table 5 reports the change of technical efficiency between 1970 and 2014 for various groups. To summarize, different groups in different classifications reflect different efficiency trends for the period from 1970-2014. Significant efficiency decrease is witnessed in lagging groups, such as low-income, less developed, agriculture-based, and African countries, whereas efficiency increase is observed in more advanced groups, such as high-income, developed, urbanized and European countries. Overall, the gap between advanced and lagging groups is enlarged during the last five decades. Table 6 reports the estimation results of σ-convergence tests for all countries and for various groups of countries. It is worth noting that each row presents the results for one regression where variance in efficiency is the dependent variable and time trend is the independent variable. This article finds no evidence of world agricultural convergence using a σ-convergence test. In contrast, the first row in Table 6 implies larger efficiency dispersion over time, which indicates agricultural divergence. The results of σ-convergence in Table 6 show that agricultural convergence occurred within lagging regions, such as low-income, less developed, agriculture-based, and African countries, respectively. This implies that the countries are getting closer to group-specific frontier countries. A possible explanation of these findings is that technology sharing and access are only available within the same group and are limited from the advanced countries. On the contrary, the advanced groups, such as developed countries, and urbanized countries, experienced divergence during the same period, indicating larger gaps across countries within the same group. In other words, some countries are more efficient, whereas others are less efficient. This may be less problematic, for example, for urbanized countries since agriculture may account for a relatively small portion of their GDP. Food insecurity and mass poverty won't happen as long as their productivity and efficiency in nonagricultural sectors are high and the international trade of agricultural products remains unobstructed. Table 7 presents the estimation results of the unconditional β-convergence tests under various classifications, which links the efficiency growth to the efficiency level of the countries that were ignored in the σ-convergence tests. For all 126 of the countries, the unconditional β-convergence test also rejects world agricultural convergence. Moreover, this article finds unconditional β-divergence, which implies that more efficient countries grow faster than less efficient countries. The results of unconditional β-convergence tests under different classifications are fairly consistent with the findings in σ-convergence tests. Advanced economies, such as developed countries and urbanized countries, experienced agricultural divergence. Agricultural convergence, on the other hand, is witnessed among lagging economies, such as Sub-Saharan African countries, low-income countries, less developed countries, and agriculture-based countries, which indicates that less efficient nations grow faster within each of these groups. The final question this article aims to answer is whether all countries can converge to a single point in the future? Tables 8 and 9 report the estimation results of the conditional β-convergence tests. When other variables are held constant, β-convergence is witnessed for world agricultural production, indicating that it is possible to achieve global convergence. Moreover, among all the 16 groups under different classifications, 11 groups achieved conditional within-group convergence, 2 groups suffered from conditional within-group divergence, and the remaining 2 groups experienced neither convergence nor divergence. This article is also interested in the role of other growth drivers on convergence. By comparing the coefficients of lagged efficiency in the unconditional convergence analysis (Table 7) with the ones in the conditional convergence analysis (Tables 8 and 9 ), we can test if considering these Standard errors are given in parentheses Asterisks *, **, and *** denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively growth drivers have contributed to world agricultural convergence. In full sample analysis, the coefficient changed from positive in the unconditional test to negative in the conditional test, indicating openness to trade and other factors controlled contributed to world agricultural convergence. Among all the 16 comparisons at group level, 75% (12/16) of the results indicate that openness to trade and other factors contributed to within-group convergence. The results of the conditional β-convergence tests also indicate how to improve efficiency and accelerate convergence in different countries in the future. Overall, the total volume of international trade, share of cropland in total agricultural land, and share of irrigated land have significantly positive, although different, effects on agricultural efficiency in most groups. More specifically, international trade is more important and has a greater impact on efficiency improvement in the lagging countries, whereas the effect is smaller in the leading countries. In terms of cropland ratio, transforming, high-income, WANA and GATT/WTO countries can benefit more from cropland than other countries. Irrigation construction can also significantly improve technical efficiency in most countries. Livestock production is more efficient than crop production in the leading countries (e.g., Europe, urbanized, highincome, and developed countries) but crop production is more efficient in the lagging countries (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa and lower middle-income countries), as the coefficient of livestock t−1 is significantly positive in the former groups but significantly negative in the latter groups. The first concern is the reliability of technical efficiency calculations. We check the robustness of the current Translog SFA model by introducing two more models. On the one hand, this article introduces technical efficiency calculated by the DEA method to see if the consistent convergence results hold, which can relax fixed functional forms in the SFA method. Some scholars (e.g., Kumar and Russell (2002) , Coelli and Rao (2005) , and Henderson and Russell (2005) ) estimate efficiency using the DEA method in agricultural convergence studies, which implements a nonparametric representation of the frontier. This article follows Deliktas and Balcilar (2005) and Headey et al. (2010) by using the DEA as a confirmatory analysis to supplement the results in the SFA. In the DEA model, the efficiency is predicted by solving the following linear programming equation: where Y accounts for the output matrix of y it , and X accounts for the input matrix of x it . λ vectors a group of constants. The efficiency score is measured by θ, which is comparable to the one derived from the SFA models. On the other hand, the true DGP remains unobserved, making it difficult for a single method to explain the agricultural technical efficiency trend sufficiently for all countries. Taking the complexity of the true DGP in cross-country agricultural production into account, this article therefore adopts the Jackknife averaging modeling procedure as the benchmark, which can assign weights based on the ability of each candidate model to explain the sample data We also employ the CSS and KSS technical efficiency scores to test the robustness of the baseline estimates. Table 10 compares the convergence results using technical efficiency scores calculated by different models. The first four columns in Table 2 present the results of σconvergence tests with the TE scores of different models. For all countries, all the three additional convergence tests deliver consistent results with our main model using SFA technical efficiency scores. In the heterogeneity analysis, the proportion of the three robust convergence results that are consistent with the main model is more than 85%. Columns (5)-(8) show the results of the unconditional βconvergence tests. For all countries, the convergence results based on TE scores of CSS, KSS and DEA methods deliver consistent conclusion that unconditional β-convergence has not occurred for all countries. Among the seventeen comparisons, the proportions of results from additional analysis that are consistent with the main model is over 75%. Columns (9)-(12) show that conditional β-convergence in agricultural technical efficiency is witnessed in all countries with different TE scores calculation methods. Among the seventeen comparisons, more than 90% of them show the same result. As a result, the additional analysis confirms the robustness of our baseline estimates. The second concern is the quality of the USDA-ERS datasets. Although there are some defects in the USDA-ERS data, it may still be difficult to replace (Villoria 2019) . The main reasons are as follows: first, although developed countries such as the United States and Australia have better databases, there is a lack of comparable data for developing countries. Second, the statistical standards of different countries are varied, which may produce additional errors in the merge of data. In order to address the possible problems posed by using the USDA-ERS data, we conduct a robustness check on the main regression results using the agricultural value-added data for each country from 1970-2018 provided by United Nations (UN) 8 , which has been widely used in studies related to agriculture productivity, such as Gollin et al. (2014) . This article establishes a value-added production function for world Standard errors are given in parentheses Asterisks *, **, and *** denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively agricultural sector in the form: where Valuedded it accounts for the agricultural value-added of country i at time t in logarithms, and x k i measures the k-th input of country i at time t in logarithms. Compared to the input choice in Eq. (2), we don't include the intermediate input variables, such as animal feed and fertilizer, as suggested in literature. Thirdly, the technical efficiency in agriculture from yearto-year data may be violated in responding to some transitory shocks. Following Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1991) and Wang et al. (2019) , this article uses the average rate of technical efficiency growth (TFP growth rate in their model) over the interval T (3 years and 5 years, respectively) to calculate σ-convergence test, unconditional β-convergence test and conditional β-convergence test. Table 11 compares the convergence results between the year-to-year analysis and the period-to-period analysis using the USDA-ERS data, as well as the ones using the UN data. The first four columns in Table 11 present the results of σ-convergence tests. For all the countries, the σ-convergence tests' results in our main model are consistent with those considering 3-year average and those using the UN value-added data 9 . Columns (5)-(8) show the results of the unconditional β-convergence tests. For all countries, the results of the unconditional β-convergence tests considering 3-year lag or using the value-added data are consistent with our main model. The unconditional β-convergence tests with 5-year lag are inconsistent with our main model because of the small sample size. Among the seventeen comparisons, the proportion of results that are consistent with the data set corresponding to the main model is nearly 75%. Columns (9)-(12) show that the conditional β-convergence in agricultural technical efficiency is witnessed in all countries with different data settings. Among the seventeen comparisons, more than 90% of them show the same result, which confirms the robustness of our baseline results. Standard errors are given in parentheses Asterisks *, **, and *** denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively Table 9 Estimation results of conditional β-convergence tests ( Standard errors are given in parentheses Asterisks *, **, and *** denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively Table 8 Estimation results of conditional Standard errors are given in parentheses Asterisks *, **, and *** denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively On the one hand, convergence is achieved for lagging country groups, such as Sub-Saharan African countries, low-income countries, less developed countries, and agriculture-based countries, in all σ-convergence and βconvergence tests. This indicates that the gap within each group is decreasing and seems to be a good signal of catchup. However, these lagging country groups all witnessed a significant decrease in average efficiency in Table 5 , which implies that they are even further behind advanced countries now than they were in 1970. Taking both findings into consideration, the leaders in these lagging country groups are less efficient, which diminishes the within-group gap, but extends the cross-group gap. To summarize, the once most-promising countries in the lagging groups fail to catch up and the gap between lagging countries and advanced countries is enlarged. On the other hand, advanced country groups, such as developed countries, raised average efficiency and therefore converged. However, σ-divergence and unconditional β-divergence are also observed in these groups. These findings together imply that more countries are catching up to the frontier, whereas the rest of them are falling behind in these advanced groups. To empirically verify this hypothesis, we reference the method used by Jin et al. (2010) to measure technological progress of the two groups (developed countries and developing countries). The results show that the average annual growth rates of Another interesting finding is that many groups achieve convergence only after other variables are controlled in the conditional β-convergence test, which implies that the agricultural efficiency gap can diminish in the ideal state when all other things are equal. Therefore, agricultural catch-up can be obtained if the lagging countries can improve irrigation system, international trade, and optimize crop-livestock structure based on relative advantages. This is of great significance to sustainable development and poverty reduction on a global scale. However, countries with lower agricultural efficiency may not be able to improve their level of relevant efficiency determinants by themselves and will therefore fail to diminish the efficiency gap. Hence, support from other countries and related organizations are necessary to achieve convergence. Finally, we find that the ""within-group"" efficiency divergence in rich countries is mainly due to the faster technological process, whereas the ""within-group"" efficiency convergence in poor countries is the result of slow growth in its frontier country. Therefore, technology transfers and spillovers from rich countries to poor countries are very important to accelerate the growth in the frontier of the poor countries.@story_separate@The aim of this article is to answer two questions: Has world agricultural convergence occurred? If not, how can D represents divergence, C represents convergence, and N represents neither of the two. The underscored results are inconsistent with the ones of the main model. The last row presents consistent results of the corresponding data settings with the main model among the seventeen comparisons this goal be fulfilled? Existing studies find that the SFA method is better than the DEA method in studying world agricultural catch-up, since it can capture the random noise and measurement error. However, the classic SFA estimator cannot capture the non-monotonic trend of technical efficiency. This article uses both CSS and KSS models to estimate more accurate country-level technical efficiency in agriculture. Three convergence tests are then employed to answer the two aforementioned questions. To our knowledge, this is the first study that employs the model averaging method to investigate world agricultural convergence. Compared with existing studies, this article also analyzes regional agricultural convergence and the potential approaches to improve agricultural efficiency and accelerate technological catch-up in different countries. Using a balanced panel of 126 countries for the period from 1970-2014, this article finds that the global average technical efficiency is 0.35, indicating the potential to increase agricultural output and the importance of agricultural convergence. Unconditional measures of convergence show all countries fail to converge to a single point. Moreover, it is possible for all countries to converge to the same equilibrium based on the conditional convergence test. This article finds that international trade and irrigation system can help diminish the efficiency gap and achieve agricultural catch-up in lagging countries. This article further investigates a within-group single steady state is achieved for different groups of countries. Lagging countries groups, such as Sub-Sahara African countries, low-income countries, less developed countries and agriculture-based countries, achieved σ-convergence and unconditional β-convergence, which implies that the within-group gaps are diminishing over time. However, the convergence is due to the slow development of the leaders in these lagging groups, rather than the catch-up of the laggards, since their gaps and distances toward the advanced countries are enlarged. Moreover, the laggards in the advanced country groups also witnessed decreasing efficiency and therefore led to divergence within those advanced groups. To summarize, the middling countries suffered from stagnation, which is the major obstacle to world agricultural convergence. Moreover, we find that even after controlling country differences in international trade, irrigation system and structural transformation, a puzzlingly large gap remains among advanced groups such as European countries, and developed countries. Future studies can investigate how to diminish this gap and how to solve the stagnation issue of the middling countries. Moreover, this article uses widely accepted classifications to do cluster convergence analysis, such as by geographical location, income level, development level, openness levels, and agricultural importance, respectively. How to identify more rational agriculture-based classification using other methods, such as club convergence tests, is worth investigating in the future. Finally, existing studies find negative impact of epidemics on agricultural productivity , it is necessary to evaluate the short-run and long-run effects of COVID-19 on world agricultural convergence when relevant data are available.","The goal of this article is to answer two questions: Has world agricultural convergence occurred? If not, how can this goal be fulfilled? This article introduces a model averaging method to consider both a parametric and a semi-parametric SFA model to better estimate technical efficiency. Then, three types of convergence tests are employed to check if world agricultural catch-up occurs and to determine the degree of convergence across different groups of countries. The empirical results on a balanced panel of 126 countries from 1970–2014 show that world agricultural convergence has not occurred. This article then investigates the situations in different groups of countries and discusses how to use international trade, irrigation system, and structural transformation to improve agricultural efficiency and to diminish the efficiency gap among different countries in the future."
"Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1, 2] . Within a few months it dispersed widely across the globe, causing severe humanitarian and economic burden, and overwhelmed health systems globally. As of 12 May 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported over 164.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including about 3.5 million deaths, globally [3] . In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the first COVID-19 case was identified on 2 March 2020. The KSA took early precautionary responses against the pandemic. The authorities enforced several timely and judicious preventive measures, including lockdown, to limit the spread of the virus [4] . These actions were believed to decrease the number of cases, fatality, and minimized economic burden in comparison with other countries [5] . Despite these efforts, by 20 May 2021 the KSA recorded 436,240 COVID-19 cases including 7201 deaths [3] . The lack of proven treatment [6] , severe burden of COVID-19 infection and its fast spread generated an urgent need of a vaccine against COVID-19, leading to an unprecedented scale and speed in the effort to develop the COVID-19 vaccine; the development hit a record by entering human clinical trial in March 2020 [7] . By April 2020, more than 100 vaccine candidates were developed across different countries using different methods; five of which were in the clinical evaluation stage, and 73 at exploratory or pre-clinical stage [7, 8] . As of 12 November 2020, the number of candidate vaccines in preclinical evaluation grew to 164, and those in clinical evaluation became 48 vaccines with four vaccines cleared for phase three trials [9] . By 7 May 2021, five vaccines against COVID-19 received approval from the WHO to roll out globally. These vaccines were the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (USA), two AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines produced by AstraZeneca-SKBio (Republic of Korea) and the Serum Institute of India, COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S developed by Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), and the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd., subsidiary of China National Biotec Group [10] . During the first quarter of 2021, the Saudi Ministry of Health was using two COVID-19 vaccines-Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 and AstraZeneca/Oxford AZD1222-to inoculate people in the Kingdom [11] . For the COVID-19 vaccine to be effective in containing the epidemic within a country without other measures like social distancing, a big percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated [12, 13] . There were differences in the acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccine in different countries-less than 55% in Russia to 90% in China [14] . In the KSA, in December 2020, 50.5% of health workers [15] and 48% of the general population [16] expressed their intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. While another study conducted in January-February 2021 reported that only 20.3% of the study participants had registered to receive the vaccine [17] . According to a study conducted in the USA, willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine declined quickly from 71% in April to 53.6% in October 2020, whereas the proportion unwilling to receive the vaccine increased from 18% to 32% in the same period. Most of those unwilling to be vaccinated feared the side effects and long-lasting health complications in addition to being uncertain of the vaccine benefits [18] , not to mention that misinformation, rumours, and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 negatively affected the willingness of the population to be vaccinated [19, 20] . The WHO identified vaccine hesitancy as a leading threat to global health. Vaccine hesitancy could be due to inconvenience in accessing vaccines, complacency, or lack of trust [21] . In addition, different unmeasurable influence/power could make the issue more complex that depends on context, time, place, and type of vaccine [22] . A multi-country study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy [14] reported that a positive attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine was associated with higher levels of education, income, a medium to high number of cases and fatality rates, and trust in the respective government. In KSA, willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, even when it was not available, was significantly associated with being >45 years old and married [23] . The Health Belief Model (HBM) is a conceptual framework that has been used to explain, predict, and influence behaviours of individuals or groups in relation to health issues. This model explains that actions related to health issues need the existence of sufficient motivation (e.g., illness or health concern), a perceived threat, the belief of a serious health problem/complication caused by that illness, perceived benefits, the belief that abiding by health recommendations would be beneficial in reducing the perceived threats, and that the benefits outweigh the costs [24] . The HBM was used by several studies to predict the intention to receive vaccines. For example, it was used to predict uptake of the influenza vaccine [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , parents' intention regarding vaccination of their children [30] , and intention of females to receive HPV vaccine [31] . In the KSA, the hesitancy in receiving the influenza vaccine was associated with the belief that it was not beneficial, people had fear of side effects, and they had a lack of perceived threat from influenza [32] . Recently, this model was used to predict COVID-19 vaccination intention in different countries [33] [34] [35] [36] . The KSA imposed phased restriction measures to contain the COVID-19 epidemic with the aim to gradually and cautiously return to normal life [4] . To achieve that goal, the country needs to inoculate most of the population. A study in the USA suggested that with 80% vaccine efficacy and 10% mask usage, 90% vaccine coverage is needed to contain the epidemic in the USA. The coverage could be decreased to 82% if mask compliance increased to 50% of the population [13] . Therefore, it was of paramount importance to study the current level of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and identify the influencing factors to assist the government and public health officials in addressing vaccine hesitancy and plan accordingly to improve vaccine uptake in KSA. In this context, this study examined the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and whether socio-demographic and HBM predicted such intention among the adults in the KSA.@story_separate@We conducted a nationwide online cross-sectional survey in the first quarter of 2021. Study population included adult (≥18 years) citizens or residents of Saudi Arabia. To disseminate our online questionnaire, we used all commonly used social media platforms in Saudi Arabia. In addition, we used our professional online groups and email networks to disseminate the questionnaire. Individuals completing the questionnaire were requested to forward the survey link to their networks. The minimum required sample size for this study was 384. Sample size was calculated using the Epi Info TM 7. For sample size calculation, we considered the following conditions: 50% expected intention frequency, 80% power, and 5% acceptable margin of error. Our questionnaire included questions on socio-demographic variables, health status, COVID-19 experience, intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and HBM constructs related to COVID-19 vaccination. Socio-demographic questions included age, gender, ethnicity, religion, marital status, education, and occupation. To assess health status, we collected information on diagnosis of chronic diseases. To assess participants' COVID-19 experience, we collected information on COVID-19 infection among participants, their family members, relatives, friends, neighbours, or colleagues. Participants' intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was assessed using a one-item question (if a vaccine against COVID-19 infection is available for you, would you take it?) on a five-point Likert type scale ('No, definitely not' to 'Yes, definitely'). We developed the questionnaire reviewing relevant literature. To ensure the relevance and clarity of the questions, the content validity of the questionnaire was assessed by a panel of public health scientists in KSA. In addition, the questionnaire was pre-tested among a group of university students. To assess the HBM constructs we asked three questions to assess perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, three questions to assess perceived severity of COVID-19 infection, two questions to assess perceived benefits of a COVID-19 vaccine, five questions to assess perceived barriers to getting a vaccination against COVID-19 and two questions to assess cues to action. We used a simplified response options-agree/disagree-since we did an online self-administered survey. Data were analysed using STATA v.12 (StataCorp LLC, TX, USA). All the study variables were categorical. At first, we conducted descriptive analyses to show the proportions of the study variables including socio-demographics, chronic diseases, diagnoses of COVID-19, and status of flu vaccination. Then, descriptive analyses were presented to show the proportions of COVID-19 related health beliefs in the category of agree or disagree. The primary study variable of our interest was intention to take COVID-19 vaccine, which collected data in four categories, such as 'definitely not', 'probably not', 'definitely yes', and 'probably yes'. For analyses, we re-categorised them into dichotomous responses, as 'definitely or probably yes' and 'definitely or probably no'. Then we examined the factors associated with intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine; chi-square tests were used to determine statistically significant association as indicated by p value < 0.05, followed by bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to determine the strength of association. Odds Ratio (OR), Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated. In the same way, we examined the association between perceived COVID-19 related health beliefs and intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. We adjusted gender, age, ethnicity, regions, education, occupation, presence of chronic disease, diagnoses of COVID-19, and status of flu vaccination during multivariate analyses. Ethical approval was obtained from the Qassim Regional Ethics Committee (IRB number: H-04-Q-001). In addition, approval was obtained from the Saudi Center for Disease Control and Prevention (registration number: 202102011). All participants were informed about the objectives of the study. They were also informed that participating in this study was completely voluntary and was not associated with any benefits or harms. The first page of the online survey form included the informed consent form. A total of 1387 people participated in our study; most of them (61%) were male. One third of the study participants belonged to the age group 18-29 years and the other third belonged to the 30-39 years age group. Most of them were Saudi (86%) and almost half of them were from Riyadh (46%). Most of them had tertiary education (85%) and one in five were healthcare workers/professionals (21%). COVID-19 was diagnosed amongst 15% of the study participants and a quarter of them (25%) reported receiving the flu vaccine every year. More than half of the study participants (58%) intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (Table 1) . When COVID-19-related health beliefs were analysed, as shown in Table 2 , it was found that the majority of the study participants disagreed on the perceived susceptibility to getting COVID-19. While severity of complications was perceived as very serious by more than half of the study participants (58%), a quarter of them (27%) agreed that they would be very sick if they got COVID-19. Two thirds of the study participants (66%) perceived benefits of getting COVID-19 vaccine. However, the majority of them were concerned about the efficacy and safety/side effects. Most of them (83%) were not concerned of the halal nature of the vaccine. A third of the study participants (32%) intended to receive the vaccine if it would be received by many in the public, but the majority of them intended to receive the vaccine after receiving complete information and if the vaccine did not cause indue problems to the vaccinated people (Table 2) . Table 3 showed unadjusted and adjusted analyses regarding factors associated with intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Unadjusted analyses showed that older people (50 years old and above), people from Qassim, healthcare workers/professionals and those who used to receive the flu vaccine every year were more likely to receive COVID-19 vaccine. However, those who identified themselves as Saudi, people from Riyadh, general workers, students, and unemployed people were less likely to elect to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Following adjustment of potential confounders, we found that three groups of people were more likely to get COVID-19 vaccine: older people (50 years old and above) (AOR 2.11, 95% CIs 1.38-3.23, p < 0.01), healthcare workers/professionals (AOR 2.50, 95% CIs 1.58-3.94, p < 0.001), and those who used to receive the flu vaccine every year (AOR 2.63, 95% CIs 1.93-3.58, p < 0.001). People from Riyadh were less likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR 0.72, 95% CIs 0.55-0.96, p < 0.05) ( Table 3) . Table 4 showed univariate and multivariate analyses for the association between perceived COVID-19-related health beliefs and intention to get the COVID-19 vaccine. People who had more agreement on perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and cues to actions were more likely to take COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, people who had more disagreement of the perceived barriers, were more likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine.  This study examined the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in KSA and how the health belief model constructs predicted such intention. We found that 15.6% and 26.8% adults would definitely and probably not accept the vaccine, respectively, whereas a recent study in the UK and USA found that the percentage of respondents who would definitely accept the vaccine to protect themselves from COVID-19 was 54.1%. In comparison, 6.0% of the respondents in the UK and 15% in the US reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine [37] . That indicated that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was higher in the KSA compared to other high-income countries. Our study revealed that younger individuals of age group 18-29 (38.2%) were more vaccine hesitant. Similar findings were reported in Ireland and the UK where individuals belonging to the age group 18-24 years were more hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [38] . Another study in Jordan and Kuwait stated that the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine was higher among males and people with higher educational status [39] ; similar findings were reported in our study that the acceptance of vaccine was higher in males (62.0%) and those who had tertiary education (84.7%). Our study also suggested that people who were previously infected with COVID-19 were more likely to receive the vaccine than those who were not infected, which was similar to the findings of other studies in Saudi Arabia [23] and France [40] . COVID-19 did not only affect physical health but also the mental health of people globally. Hence, their experience of suffering from COVID-19 might be the reason for the higher intent to receive the vaccine. A vast majority of the study participants (66%) believed that chances of getting the infection would reduce after taking the vaccine. Similar results were reported for the COVID-19 vaccine among the general population in Russia [41] , in Bangladesh [36] , and the residents from Northern Italy [42] . On a positive note, most of the participants who indicated high perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and perceived benefits were more likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. This was in line with other study findings in Malaysia where the health belief model was used to assess COVID-19 vaccine intake among the general population [33] . A study conducted in Hong Kong reported that COVID-19 vaccine intake was significantly associated with perceived severity, perceived benefits of the vaccine, cues to action, self-reported health outcomes, and trust in the healthcare system or vaccine manufacturers [43] . Among the perceived barriers, the major concern among the participants was that the vaccine might not be halal. Similarly, a recent study among Bangladeshi residents revealed that the negative intent was associated with the concern that the vaccine might not be halal [36] . This was due to the fact that most of the participants were practicing Islam and would avoid anything that is not permissible by the religion. Despite that, it was evident that the participants who had disagreement on perceived barriers and constructs of HBM were highly likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. This was completely contrary to the study conducted in Hong Kong where no correlation was found between perceived barriers and vaccination intention [43] . Another study states that belief in COVID-19 misinformation significantly reduced willingness to get the vaccine [20] . Therefore, van der Linden et al. (2021) suggested that to combat vaccine misinformation, the public should be immunized against misinformation-a process that could draw on the concept of psychological inoculation [44] . Also, vaccine acceptability would increase once additional information about vaccine safety and efficacy could be made available in the public domain, preferably by a trusted, centralized source of information [45] . This study provided a glimpse of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among the general population of KSA. The main strength of the study was a larger sample size compared to other similar studies on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the KSA. However, we did not have equal representation from all socio-demographic groups such as age, gender, nationality, and region. The cross-sectional nature of the study indicated that we could not draw any causal relationship between intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and the associated factors. In addition, we were unable to rule out the possibility of selection bias since we used online platforms such as social media to recruit study participants. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. Data Availability Statement: Data used for this study are presented in the manuscript and any request for raw data access will be available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.@story_separate@This study revealed that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was high in the KSA. The HBM constructs also predicted willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Perceived susceptibility to and severity of the COVID-19 vaccine and perceived benefits of the vaccine against COVID-19 were positively associated with COVID-19 vaccination intention, whereas perceived barriers were negatively associated. Individuals were more likely to get the vaccine after obtaining complete information and when vaccination would be more common amongst the public. The KSA aimed to return to normal life gradually and cautiously from the COVID-19 restriction measures. In this context, proper vaccination coverage could help in reducing the infection and subsequent mortality rates due to COIVD-19. Therefore, public health campaigns in the KSA should consider adopting the HBM to promote COVID-19 vaccine in the population. Institutional Review Board Statement: The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the Institutional Review Board (or Ethics Committee) of the Qassim Regional Ethics Committee (IRB number: H-04-Q-001) and the Saudi Center for Disease Control and Prevention (registration number: 202102011).","We examined the intention and predictors of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia. We conducted a nation-wide, cross-sectional online survey between February and March 2021. A total of 1387 people (≥18 years) participated. Only 27.3% adults had a definite and 30.2% had a probable vaccination intent; 26.8% and 15.6% had a probable and definite negative vaccination intent. Older people (≥50 years) (p < 0.01), healthcare workers/professionals (p < 0.001), and those who received flu vaccine (p < 0.001) were more likely to have a positive intent. People from Riyadh were less likely to receive the vaccine (p < 0.05). Among the health belief model constructs, perceived susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 (p < 0.001), and perceived benefit of the vaccine (p < 0.001) were positively associated with vaccination intent, whereas perceived barriers had a negative association (p < 0.001). Individuals were more likely to receive the vaccine after obtaining complete information (p < 0.001) and when the vaccine uptake would be more common amongst the public (p < 0.001)."
"Public health emergency (PHE) refers to the sudden occurrence of major infectious diseases such as congregative disease of unknown reasons, serious food and occupational poisoning, and other events that severely threaten public health (China, 2011) . Since the beginning of the 21 st century, several major PHEs related to infectious disease have challenged public health globally (Holshue et al., 2020; Lai, Shih, Ko, Tang, & Hsueh, 2020; Remuzzi & Remuzzi, 2020) . The ongoing PHE is coronavirus disease-2019 with the first confirmed case reported in December, 2019. The COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic on March 11(Director-General, 2020) . Up to April 15, the confirmed COVID-19 global cases were 1914916 with 123010 deaths (WHO, 2020a) . Several pandemics emerged over the past two decades including SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), (Drosten et al., 2003; Zaki, van Boheemen, Bestebroer, Osterhaus, & Fouchier, 2012) and Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which started in Guinea 2014, then spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia (Holmes, Dudas, Rambaut, & Andersen, 2016) . SARS has caused 8422 global cumulative cases and 916 deaths by August 7 in 2003 (WHO, 2003 . At the end of September 2019, a total of 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS, including 851 associated deaths (casefatality rate: 34.4%) were reported globally (WHO, 2019) . The Ebola epidemic in Democratic Republic of the Congo has been around since 2018 (Team, 2018) , with 3456 confirmed cases and 2266 deaths reported up to April 12 (WHO, 2020b) . These major PHEs have challenged the development of human society in the new era. Mental health consequences associated with PHEs need to be addressed as much as physical health consequences (Chen et al., 2020; Shultz, Baingana, & Neria, 2015; Y. Yang et al., 2020 ). PHEs exposed individuals to multiple stressors including physical health consequences associated with disease , anxiety over getting infected (Asmundson & Taylor, 2020) , social isolation (Brooks et al., 2020) , depression due to quarantine (Hawryluck et al., 2004) , and other stressful events arise during epidemic (e.g., unemployment and loss of loved ones) (Chaves, Castellanos, Abrams, & Vazquez, 2018) . One common psychological distress resulted from PHEs is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a psychological disorder that occurs after traumatic events (Lötsch, Schnyder, Goorhuis, & Grobusch, 2017; Rogers et al., 2020) . Chan and Huak reported that two months after SARS outbreak, around 20% of 661 healthcare workers (HCWs) of a medium size regional general hospital in Singapore, had a probable PTSD diagnosis (Chan & Huak, 2004) . Hawryluck et al (2004) examined the psychological effects of quarantine during SARS epidemic among individuals in Toronto, Canada, and found that 28.9% of 129 participants showed symptoms of PTSD (Hawryluck et al., 2004) . Diagnosis of PTSD could be conducted by psychiatrists using uniform diagnostic criteria for symptoms (e.g. Chinese Classification and Diagnostic Criteria of Mental Disorders 3rd edition (CCMDIII), DSM-IV). Having individuals completed a self-rated psychometric scale and see if they met the cut-off score of PTSD could lead to a probable PTSD diagnosis (Hawryluck et al., 2004; Su et al., 2007) . Individuals being diagnosed with PTSD or met cut-off score were considered to have significant posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Due to more cautious considerations on clinical diagnosis, the heterogeneity of PTSS prevalence rate caused by screening method is high (Lancee, Maunder, Goldbloom, & Coauthors for the Impact of, 2008; Maunder et al., 2006) . In addition, the prevalence rate of PTSS under PHEs varied across time course of the PHE and population group. The amount of follow-up studies on PTSS prevalence was limited and shows inconsistent results. For example, Lee et al found that the prevalence rate of PTSS decreased over time after MERS (12-18 months: 42%-27%)(S. H. Lee et al., 2019) , but another study tracked the prevalence of PTSS in SARS convalescent patients and found the rate to be stable at different time points: 40% (2.5 months), 41% (7 months), 39% (10 months), 40% (24 months), and 39% (46 months) (Hong et al., 2009) . The prevalence rate of PTSS tends to be high among patients . Shi et al (2005) found that prevalence rate in patients, first-line HCWs, second-line HCWs, general HCWs, and colleges students after SARS epidemic were 50%, 5%, 5%, 0%, and 7%, respectively (Shi et al., 2005) . investigated the prevalence of PTSS in residents during COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China, and found the rate was 7%(N. . Moreover, it was still unexplored that whether the prevalence under PHEs were affected by different country and epidemic A systematic review evaluated the psychological impact of deploying in support of the U.S. Response to Ebola by analyzing articles related to infectious disease and HCWs. It was estimated that effect sizes for PTSD was relatively small and non-significant (SMD = 0.12, 95%CI = -0.23 to 0.47, HCWs vs. low-risk control group) (Vyas, Delaney, Webb-Murphy, & Johnston, 2016) . Another study systematically reviewed the long-term neuropsychological effects of the Ebola outbreak on survivors and found that PTSD was one of the five most common sequelae (Lötsch et al., 2017) . To our knowledge, there is still lack of the overall estimation of prevalence rate of PTSS under the influence of major PHEs. To fill this gap, we conducted a meta-analytic review to improve our understanding of trauma-related mental health related to PHEs and further explored variation in prevalence by country, epidemic, time period, population group, screening method and study quality. type that conference proceedings and dissertations were also included. The searches were concluded by March 21, 2020. Two unpublished manuscripts were included with the approval of their authors. @story_separate@The following inclusion criteria were applied:1) participants under the influence of PHE; 2) prevalence of PTSS in study samples being surveyed and reported; 3) use of measures that have good psychometrics to assess PTSS or retrieve from reliable records. The following studies were excluded from this meta-analysis:1) commentary, editorial, case report or review; 2) not reporting prevalence data; 3) studies explicitly referring to different disorders, such as depressive symptoms. 4) articles that could not be retrieved in full-text form through online databases, library requests or email correspondence with the authors of the studies. Two authors screened the title and/or abstracts independently, and then full text of the studies was retrieved and being independently assessed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The two independent authors also applied a uniform data extraction form to record data such as authors, publication year, countries, epidemic, time after epidemic, study participants, screen tools, sample size, the prevalence of PTSS and other subgroup data, etc. For studies (k=3) with multiple assessment points, a mean value of combined results was calculated when estimating the overall prevalence rate; all time points were used as a separate study when estimating the prevalence rate across different time points. The 'time after epidemic' was estimated based on information provided by article and records on World Health Organization website (e.g. summary table of SARS cases by country) (WHO, 2003) . When the same sample were assessed using multiple assessments, a mean value of combined prevalence rate was calculated. when multiple studies were based on the same dataset, the study with a larger sample size was included. Interrater reliability was calculated for continuous variables (e.g. event rate, sample size) using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and for categorical moderators (e.g. study quality, country, epidemic). Interrater agreement was high (ICC=0.99 and Kappa=0.77 for continuous and categorical variables, respectively) across studies, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. We divided the participants in the studies into three categories: patients, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f healthcare workers (HCWs), and community samples. Patients referred to individuals with diseases related to PHEs. HCWs referred to individuals who provided medical services. Frontline HCWs referred to medical workers who had direct contact with patients. Community samples included individuals who are in quarantine, college students, residents, persons visiting the community primary health care and patients in psychiatric department (mixed sample). The quality of each study was assessed by a Risk of Bias Tool for prevalence studies developed by Hoy et al. (2012 )(Hoy et al., 2012 . The tool consists of 10 items, divided into external validity and internal validity subscales. The external validity subscale has four items, including representation of the national population, sampling frame, random sampling, and nonresponse bias. The internal validity subscale has six items: data collected directly from the subjects or a proxy, case definition, quality of instruments, consistency of data collection mode, the length of the prevalence period, and the calculation of prevalence. Each item was assigned a score of 1 (yes, high quality) or 0 (no, low quality), thus the total score ranged from 1-10. Consistent with previous studies (Tang, Tang, Ren, & Wong, 2019) , the quality of each study was classified as high (> 8), moderate (6) (7) (8) , or low (≤5). Two investigators (Yaoguang Zhou and Luna Sun) independently assigned the scores, and inconsistencies were resolved by discussion. The detail of quality assessment is shown in Supplementary Materials. Due to the between-studies heterogeneity, a random effects model was applied to estimate the mean value of prevalence rate, and it gave an overall estimate across studies weighted by sampling error and true variance (Borenstein, Hedges, & Rothstein, 2007) . The Q-value was chosen as an indicator of heterogeneity, with p less than .05 suggesting a significant heterogeneity across studies. In addition, we made a raw comparison between the estimated mean prevalence rate with the PTSD prevalence rate in National Epidemiologic Survey(NES) (Pietrzak, Goldstein, Southwick, & Grant, 2011) . NES refers to an up-to-date assessment of the lifetime prevalence and Axis I comorbidity of DSM-IV PTSD and partial PTSD, with a representative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population (n=34653). We performed subgroup analysis stratified by countries, epidemic, time periods, population groups, screening method, and study quality. Since there were more homogeneous group in included studies (i.e. studies from China, studies in SARS, studies within 6 months after epidemic, studies in sample of community samples, healthcare workers and patients), sensitivity analyses were conducted with subgroup moderators mentioned above in those groups. Sensitivity analyses were also performed by leave one out analysis. Meta-regression model was built by using maximum likelihood calculation to find moderators that explained the majority of the variance across studies. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's tests. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (V3, Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA) was used J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f for the meta-analyses. The screening process is shown in Figure 1 . Based on the search terms, we found a total of 158 non-duplicate articles. Of these, 33 were excluded by screening titles and abstracts, leaving a total of 125 full texts to be assessed for eligibility. After the full text screening, 40 articles met the inclusion criteria. Of the 85 articles that were excluded, 46 were commentary, editorial, case report or review, 13 did not report prevalence data, 3 were not PTSS study conducted under the influence of public health emergency. 20 had duplicate samples and 3 were not accessible in full-text-form. Table 1 shows 40 included studies with a total of 15538 participants. Sample sizes ranged from 29 to 3564. These studies were from 8 countries and 5 PHEs (SARS, Ebola, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, MERS, COVID-19), with three major of population group participating in these studies: patients, HCWs, and community samples. Fourteen studies obtained their samples from patients, 17 from HCWs and 13 from community samples. The investigation was conducted on 0-46 months from the time of epidemic. Dates of publication ranged from 2004-2020. Ten self-report scales were used to identify PTSS: The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Impact of Event Scale (IES), the PTSD checklist (PCL), the PTSD self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), Davidson Trauma Scale-Chinese version(DTS-C), the posttraumatic diagnostic scale for DSM-5 (PDS-5), the Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6, a shortened version of the full IES-R), the PTSD Checklist-Specific (PCL-S), PTSD checklist Cuvukuab version (PCL-C), PTSD checklist for . Two interview scales were used to identify PTSD diagnose: Composite International Diagnostic Interview-PTSD, Version 2.1 (CIDI 2.1), Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Regarding study quality, 3 out of 40 studies are of high quality, 34 are of moderate quality, and 3 are of low quality. The overall pooled estimates of PTSS reported by 40 studies yielded a crude summary of prevalence of 17.0% (95% CI: 13.5%-21.2%) with significant heterogeneity present (Q = 1199, I 2 = 96.75%, p < .001). See Figure 2 . Under a raw comparison (17.0% vs 6.6% and 6.4%), the 95%CI lower limit (13.5%) of estimated prevalence in current study is higher than the upper limit of prevalence of PTSD (9.9%) and partial PTSD (10.1%) in a National Epidemiologic Survey(NES), suggesting a significant difference on the level of α = .05. See Table 2 . To further determine the source of heterogeneity, meta-analyses stratified by multiple moderators were conducted (See Table 3 ). When stratified by countries, there was significant heterogeneity in the estimates of PTSS prevalence (p < .001). Specifically, prevalence of each country were as follows: Canada, 12.4% (95CI%: J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 7.0%-21.2%); China, 16.2% (95CI%: 10.7%-23.8%); Guinea, 6.3% (95CI%: 2.9%-13.4%); Korea, 36.5% (95CI%: 20.6%-56.0%); Liberia, 4.0% (95CI%: 1.9%-8.2%); Sierra Leone, 20.3% (95CI%: 10.0%-33.6%); Singapore, 20.8% (95CI%: 14.1%-29.5%); Turkey, 18.5% (95CI%: 10.3%-31.1%). When stratified by China vs other countries (16.2%, k=21 vs 17.8%, k=19), there was no significant heterogeneity between two groups (p = .700). Between-group Q value was reduced to .418 (Q value was 31.931 when grouping by different countries). Subsequent analysis of prevalence of PTSS on different variables among studies from China was presented at Table S1 . When stratified by different PHEs, there was no significant heterogeneity in the estimates of PTSS prevalence (p =.095). Specifically, prevalence in each epidemic were as follows: COVID-19, 13.5% (95CI%: 4.6%-33.1%); Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, 18.5% (95CI%: 10.3%-31.1%); Ebola, 12.1% (95CI%: 6.7%-21.0%); MERS, 36.5% (95CI%: 20.6%-56.0%); SARS, 17.4% (13.4%-22.3%). When stratified by SARS vs other PHEs (17.4%, k=24 vs 16.5%, k=16), heterogeneity was not significant (p = .826). Between-group Q value was reduced to .049 (Q value was 7.21 when grouping by different PHEs). Subsequent analysis of prevalence of PTSS on different variables among SARS-related studies was presented at Table S2 . The prevalence of PTSS fluctuated along with the time course. And there was no significant heterogeneity on different time period (p = .290). During the epidemic, the estimated PTSS prevalence rate was 16.1% (95CI%: 10.3%-24.2%). The estimated rate after 1-3 moths, 4-6 months, 7-12 months, 13-24 months, >24months were respectively 23.7% (95CI%: 17.1%-32.0%), 12.4% (95CI%: 7.1%-20.7%), 25.6%(95CI%: 14.1%-41.9%), 19.2% (95CI%: 7.9%-39.7%), 23.0% (95CI%:8.6%-48.4%). Subsequent analysis of prevalence of PTSS on different variables among studies within 6 months was presented at Table S3 . The prevalence of PTSS among patients (26.2%, 95%CI: 13.1%-37.9%) was significantly higher than community samples (12.4%, 95%CI: 9.1%-16.6%), and HCWs had a moderate prevalence rate (18.5%, 95%CI: 12.7%-26.2%), with significant heterogeneity among these three groups (p = .014). In group of HCWs, frontline HCWS had marginally significantly higher PTSS prevalence rate than general HCWs (22.2%, 95%CI:16.0%-30.1% vs. 10.4%, 95%CI: 6.4%-16.6%). The heterogeneity was significant (p = .009). Subsequent analysis of prevalence of PTSS on different variables among different population groups was presented at Table  S4-S6. When stratified by screening method, the estimated pooled prevalence rate screened by interview was lower than that screened by self-report scale (10.8%, 95%CI: 6.3%-18.1% vs. 19.1%, 95%CI: 14.8%-24.3%), with marginally significant heterogeneity between these two groups (p = .051). In terms of study quality, there was no significant heterogeneity (p = .238) among studies with high (12.4%, 95%CI: 0.09%-16.8%), moderate (17.3%, 95%CI: 12.9%-22.8%) and low (18.0%, 95%CI: 10.7%-28.7%) quality, with higher quality possessing lower estimated prevalence rate. Subgroup moderators were all included as covariates of a meta regression model, except epidemic which caused high collinearity with other variables. Thirty-five studies were available from regression analysis based on datasets. The test of the model showed that Q = 50.93, df = 17, p < .001, suggesting the model was significantly efficient on explaining the variance across studies. The proportion of total between-study variance explained by the model was 64% (R 2 =0.64, See Table  4 ). Sensitivity analysis, carried out leave one out analysis by omitting each study, demonstrated that no individual study affected the prevalence estimate of PTSS under the influence of PHE more than 4.7%. Details were presented in Figure S1 . Visual inspection of the funnel plot of studies revealed significant asymmetry (see Figure 7) . Evidence of substantial publication bias was not identified using Egger's test (p = .41). This systematic meta-analysis of 40 studies involving 15538 participants under the influence of PHEs yielded an estimated prevalence of PTSS of 17.0%. As reported in results, the Wave 2 NES on Alcohol and Related Conditions reported the lifetime full PTSD and partial PTSD were 6.4% and 6.8% in United States, respectively (Pietrzak et al., 2011) . Although the true deviation was obscure due to the bias confounded in meta-analytic result (e.g., mixed samples, time period), the prevalence of PTSS following PHEs was higher than the lifetime prevalence of general population. Furthermore, another study investigated the 12 month PTSD prevalence in the worldwide scale found that the prevalence rate was 1.1% in the total sample (Karam et al., 2014) . Those evidences preliminarily demonstrated that more attention should be paid to the trauma-related psychological impacts caused by PHEs. Subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence rate varied across countries and epidemics, but this variance became minimal when stratified by China and other countries (from 4.0%-36.5% to 16.2%-17.8%), and SARS and other PHEs (from 13.5-36.5% to 16.5%-17.4%). With increased studies included in each subgroup, the pooled prevalence was closer to the overall estimate of 17.0%, suggesting the representativeness of our results. However, the results should still be taken with caution due to the heterogeneity in each subgroup. Among the included studies, there were relatively high correlations between country and epidemic. For instance, the prevalence of PTSS under COVID-19 and SARS was mainly reported in China, while EVD was mainly reported in African countries. After controlling one variable (country or epidemic, Table S1-S2) or setting a multivariate regression model, our results preliminarily showed country or epidemic might not had a significant effect on J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f prevalence rate; However, there was a considerable amount of within-group heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the cross-cultural variations in PTSS prevalence has been previously reported in multiple large-scale investigations. In 2005, Kessler and colleagues have reported lifetime PTSD prevalence in the USA of 7.8% and 12-month prevalence of 3.9% (Kessler et al., 2005) . Creamer et al (2001) have reported a much lower 12-month PTSD prevalence (1.3%) in Australia, despite comparable levels of exposure to trauma (Creamer, Burgess, & McFarlane, 2001) . Relative to the USA, the prevalence of PTSD is lower in Canada (2.7% for woman and 1.2% for men) (Stein, Walker, Hazen, & Forde, 1997) , China (0.2%) (Karam et al., 2014) , and 12 European countries (1.1%) (Darves-Bornoz et al., 2008) . Therefore, there was complexity in the cross-cultural differences on the morbidity of PTSD and it could be still implicated that trauma-related mental health emergency strategies towards PHEs ought to be rigorously planned on the reference to those differences. In addition, to truly understand the impact of different PHEs on PTSS, a comparative study of more homogenous population groups in different epidemics was need but relevant research is rare. The PTSS prevalence fluctuated over time, which was mainly related to mixed characteristics in general population samples, healthcare workers, and patients. The PTSS prevalence in the general public was relatively low, with highest prevalence emerging on 1-3 months after epidemic, and only available for three time windows (0, 1-3, 4-6). There was a trend of declining in prevalence of HCWs and constant high level in patients. But the studies for each time window in each population group was highly heterogeneous or limited in numbers (Table S3-S6) . Notably, there is a lack of obvious decline in prevalence rate, with peak observed among 7-12 months after epidemic. The presence of PTSS could be delayed relative to the occurrence of traumatic event(Carty, O'Donnell, & Creamer, 2006) , along with the possibility of suffering from subsequent traumatic event (Pietrzak et al., 2011) . Meanwhile, PTSS could exist in a long time after index trauma. For instance, according to an investigation in US army, approximately 9000 veterans endured PTSS 40 years after Vietnam War (Marmar et al., 2015) . To more accurately describe the longitudinal trajectory of PTSS under the PHEs, future studies should conduct longer follow-up studies among different populations, as well as examine the protective and risk factor towards PTSS. In conclusion, these results preliminarily suggested that the prevalence was relatively high in a long time period. The wide range time effect of PTSS implicated the crucial need for consistent intervention and care towards posttraumatic psychiatry after PHEs. Patients who had higher risk of confronted with stressful experience (e.g. fear of deterioration) and physical lesion, had highest prevalence among participant groups. The estimated prevalence of patients in the current study was comparable to another systematic review that reported the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in adult critical care survivors was 19.8% (Righy et al., 2019) . HCWs also had a relatively high prevalence of PTSS, with frontline HCWs yielding higher estimated rate than general HCWs. As a systematic review concluded, work-related critical incidents are positively related to PTSS(de Boer et al., 2011) .The front-line personnel are in direct J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f contact with patients, facing greater challenges in work intensity and complexity, as well as safety protection. The PTSS of the community samples is relatively low, while the estimated rate was still higher than majority of the other trauma-related conditions reported in a national survey (Kessler et al., 2017) . Some effective control measures towards the epidemic, such as quarantine, may also be positively correlated with PTSS (Brooks et al., 2020) . Hence it is necessary to develop targeted psychological protection in PHE based on the posttraumatic characteristics of different populations. The prevalence screened by interview which was constantly regarded as a more objective way to evaluate the PTSS was estimated lower than by self-reported assessment. It could be inferred that positive PTSD confirmed by interview tended to be discreet in diagnostic process, for more comprehensive evaluation of psychopathological symptoms, traumatic events, and considerations of following consequences of a psychiatric verdict being needed (Bonfils et al., 2018) , while the PTSS points rated by self-reported scales were constantly seen as a reference to the symptom severity. It was also demonstrated that studies with higher quality were estimated at higher rate than lower ones, which is similar to another systematic review studying the prevalence of depress symptoms in Chinese young adolescents (Tang et al., 2019) . The above results suggested that the difference in psychometric measurements and the study quality may lead to bias in the estimated PTSS prevalence related to PHEs. The strength of this study is thoroughly reviewed studies that examined PTSS under the influence of PHEs and applied multivariate meta-regression model to investigate variances explained by subgroup moderators. Nevertheless, several limitations should be noted. First, there was a relatively high risk of bias in included studies, with only a few studies used probability sampling and had a high study quality. Second, there is a high heterogeneity (36%) among studies remains largely unexplained by the variables investigated. Third, the main results remained to be updated for the COVID-19 epidemic since there are ongoing surveys concerning the trauma-related mental health. Fourth, the study was not pre-registered and might lead to potential bias by post hoc decisions in review methods (Liberati et al., 2009) . Lastly, samples included in this study could not represent the general population, leading to an imbalance of sample composition and biased estimation of prevalence.@story_separate@In summary, our study suggests that PTSS are frequently experienced by various population under PHEs and the impact can be long-lasting. Several strategies can be taken to improve the accuracy of estimated prevalence rate. For example, future studies may include larger-scale samples by probability sampling, use statistical methods to eliminate the variance between screening by interview and self-report, utilize measurements with good psychometric properties and valid cutoffs for the targeted population, and conduct a longer follow-up. Moreover, since the correlated factors of PTSS under the PHEs had been studied in previous articles, more high-quality investigations and systematic reviews are needed to explore the characteristics and mechanism of PTSS under PHEs. Finally, more randomized J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of 21st century, several major public health emergencies (PHEs) have threatened the health of people globally. Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was one of the most concerned mental health problems. The objective of this study is to systematically estimate the prevalence of PTSS under the influence of PHEs. METHOD: We searched both English and Chinese databases. This meta-analysis used a random-effects model to estimate the prevalence of PTSS. Subgroup analysis were conducted to analyze the source of heterogeneity. Meta-regression model was used to calculate the proportion of the variance explained by subgroup moderators. RESULTS: Forty eligible studies (n = 15,538) were identified. The results revealed a pooled prevalence of PTSS of 17.0% (95%CI: 13.5%–21.2%), higher than that of previous epidemiological survey, with high between-studies heterogeneity (Q = 1199, I(2) = 96.75%, p < .001). There was variance of prevalence in different countries (4%–36.5%) and epidemics (12.1%–36.5%). The prevalence of PTSS showed the feature of fluctuation in the change of time (Q = 6.173, p = .290). Patients had higher prevalence (26.2%) compared to healthcare workers (HCWs) (18.5%) and community samples (12.4%) and frontline HCWs had marginally significantly higher estimated rate than general HCWs (22.2%, 95%CI:16.0%–30.1% vs. 10.4%, 95%CI: 6.4%–16.6%). The variance of prevalence screened by interview and self-reported was significant (Q = 3.393, p = .05) and studies with higher quality possessed lower prevalence (high:12.4%; moderate: 17.3%; low: 18.0%). The total variance explained by subgroup moderators was estimated 64% by meta regression model. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include high level of heterogeneity between studies and within subgroups as well as the lack of studies with high quality and using probability sampling. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the PTSS was common under the influence of PHEs. It was crucial to further explore the psychological mechanism and effective strategies for prevention and intervention in future research with more high-quality studies."
"The 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic is the most severe health crisis in the past 100 years. As of June 07, 2021, approximately 173 million cases have been reported worldwide, with more than 3.72 million deaths (WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard). In addition to the zoonotic agents responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is a spherical-enveloped virus with a positivesense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) which belongs to the broad Coronaviridae family and the Nidovirales order [1, 2] . The SARS-CoV-2 genome comprises about 30, 000 nucleotides, including open reading frames (ORFs) responsible for encoding structural and non-structural proteins. ORF1a and ORF1b are translated into two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, respectively [1] . These polyproteins are processed by the viral proteases M pro (main protease) and PL pro (papain-like protease) into 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs). Other ORFs undergo discontinuous transcription, and subgenomic mRNAs are translated into other non-structural, accessory, and structural molecules, such as envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [3, 4] . SARS-CoV-2 M pro is a dimer composed of three domains (the catalytic domains I and II and the C-terminal domain III), with the catalytic dyad formed by the residues His41 and Cys145 located in a cleft between domains I (residues 10-99) and II (residues 100-182) [5] . Dimerization is essential for SARS-CoV-2 M pro enzymatic activity since the NH2-terminal residues (N-finger) of each monomer interact with the Glu166 residue of the other monomer, which effectively contributes to the correct arrangement of the S1 pocket of the substrate binding site. Thus, the C-and N-terminus of the monomers form the dimeric interface of the active protein and are less flexible in comparison to their higher mobility in the free monomers [5] . This general protein architecture is highly conserved in M pro s of diverse coronaviruses [6] ; therefore, despite the extensive mutagenesis of these viruses in general, these key proteins are well conserved [7] and, therefore, are good targets for preventing virus replication and proliferation and reducing the risk of mutation-mediated drug resistance in new viral strains. Thus, the inhibition of M pro enzymatic activity could be an interesting strategy for exploring new therapeutic approaches to treat COVID-19. Indeed, non-structural proteins have been reported as potential targets for the design and development of antiviral agents against SARS and MERS [8] . Recently, six worrisome SARS-CoV-2 variants, commonly associated with a potential escape of the immune response and a more transmissible and infectious capacity, were first detected in the UK (Alpha, B.1.1.7) [9] , in South Africa (Beta, B.1.351) [10, 11] , in Brazil/Japan (Gama, P.1) [12] , in India (Delta, B.1.617+) [13] , in USA/California (Epsilon, B.1.429+B.1.427) [14] and in UK/Nigeria (Eta, B.1.525) [15] . Interestingly, the genomic analysis of these variants listed in the GISAID database (https:gisaid.org) [16] highlights a set of frequent mutations such as K90R, P108S, From a protein dynamics perspective, it would be worth investigating the structural effects of these amino acid substitutions on the stability, activation, reactivity, and catalytic activity related to SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Hence, in this work, we analyzed the molecular characteristics as solvent accessible surface areas, the conformation of the catalytic dyad, and the flexibility of the regions involved in dimerization and substrate binding in wild-type and different SARS-CoV-2 M pro mutants. A set of conformations of these molecules was generated using in silico methods based on all-atom molecular normal modes calculation. The results indicated that specific single mutations in SARS-CoV-2 M pro could cause important changes in structural and dynamical characteristics regarding collective movements, the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the dimer interface, energetically accessible conformations, and arrangement of the catalytic dyad. These changes may influence the function and stability of SARS-CoV-2 M pro present in important viral variants and could contribute to the emergence of harmful strains of SARS-CoV-2. This work analyzed the wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 M pro and several mutants using a hybrid approach in silico protocol to understand the possible influence of single mutations on this essential viral protein. The results shown here indicated that some of these mutations affect the SARS-CoV-2 M pro structural dynamics and may potentially alter the functional properties of this macromolecule.@story_separate@A Hybrid Method (VMOD, a module of the CHARMM program) that combines Normal Mode Analysis and low-temperature Molecular Dynamics simulations (described in the next section) was used to analyze the global motions and conformational changes for both WT and mutants of SARS-CoV-2 M pro . The characterization of the protein structural dynamics was done with the following analyses: a) flexibility with the Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF); b) analysis of collective modes of wild-type and mutants (correspondence/correlation calculation); c) conformational sampling using hybrid methods; d) distance analysis between the two residues of the catalytic dyad; e) SASA analysis for different regions; f) analysis of the frequency of occurrence of mutants in the patient data deposited in the GISAID database. were assigned in the PDB2PQR server [18] . The protonated structures were submitted to the Solution Builder module of the CHARMM-GUI web server [19] [20] [21] to generate the input files for the molecular dynamics simulation used to analyze the Normal Modes [22] [23] [24] . We followed the protocol as outlined below: • Selection of a dimeric wild-type and apo SARS-CoV-2 M pro structure in PDB. • Selection of SARS-CoV-2 M pro mutants described by Amamuddy et al, 2020 [17] . • Building 48 mutants using Pymol and protonation with PDB2PQR server (see Figure 1 ). It is important to highlight that the start point of this study is the mutants reported by Amamuddy et al. (2020) [17] . • Energy minimization of the WT and mutants of SARS-CoV-2 M pro . • Calculation of the first 18 lowest frequency modes with an all-atom approach. The lowest frequency normal modes represent the collective motions of the protein. • Analysis and selection of the mutants with a significant difference of RMSF compared to wild-type. We considered four important regions [5, 17] presented in Table 1 to accomplish this analysis. • Generation of energetically relaxed conformations along the lowest frequency normal modes by carrying out a low temperature MD and energy minimizations (the first 6 modes). Table 1 : Important regions of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro used as reference to compare the RMSFs and select the most significant mutants [5, 17] .

The backbone color corresponds to the RMSFs values for the WT where blue and red represent more rigid and flexible respectively. The positions of mutation for the mutants selected by RMSF (described in Table 2 ) are highlighted by spheres colored according to the characteristic of mutation: a) conservative (no charge change) in brown, b) charge inversion in cyan, c) polar to apolar without charge in red, d) special residue in magenta. Figure generated in PyMOL. Initially, the protein structure was minimized in two stages. In the first one harmonic constraints were applied and progressively decreased (250 to 0 kcal mol -1 Å -2 ) and for each constraint value 500 steps of gradient conjugate (CG) were applied. After the CG minimization the constraints were removed and 2x10 5 steps of adopted basis NeWTon Raphson (ABNR) were used with the convergence criterion of 10 -6 kcal mol -1 Å -1 RMS to energy gradient. The normal modes were calculated using the DIMB (Iterative Mixed-Basis Diagonalization) module [24] implemented in CHARMM software [25, 26] considering all the atoms of the protein and a force field corresponding to the CHARMM36m [27] . A set of the first six normal modes describing the internal movements were computed to ensure that all relevant large amplitude motions were included in our analysis. This is a sufficient set to ensure that all relevant large amplitude movements are included in our analysis. The modes corresponding to global rotation and translation were discarded. In the treatment of nonbonded interactions the Van der Waals (VDW) ones were computed up to 5 Å and a switching function was used to approximate these interactions until 9 Å. A distance-dependent dielectric constant (e=2ri,j) was employed to treat the shielding of electrostatic interactions by the solvent. In the work described here such a function has a good performance to predict realistic intrinsic global movements for all structures (WT and mutants of SARS-CoV-2 M pro ). To obtain energetically allowed displaced structures along selected normal modes, we used the VMOD module from CHARMM [24] that makes use of harmonic This procedure ensures that the structure slowly converges to the desired displacement. The restrain force Kd value was increased from 1,000 to 10,000 kcal·mol -1 Å −2 during successive 10 ps MD simulations. Velocities were assigned at random corresponding to a temperature of 30 K in the MD. The Berendsen thermostat with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps was used in all low temperature simulations. Using a low-temperature dynamic allows for a more efficient conformational search than using only energy minimizations. A final MD simulation was achieved with a Kd value of 20,000 kcal·mol -1 Å −2 followed by 1,000 steepest descent and 1000 conjugate gradient steps of minimizations to reach the final displacement target along the mode.Using this procedure 66 structures were generated (11 structures per mode x 6 modes) for each molecular system considered. According to Ramos-Guzmán et al. (2020) [29] , the reaction mechanism proposed to proteolysis catalyzed by SARS-CoV-2 M pro involves two steps, the acylation and deacylation steps. Briefly, in the first one the Sγ atom of Cys145 achieves nucleophilic attack to substrate peptide bond, before that occurs the formation of catalytic dyad ion pair by proton transfer from Sγ atom to the Nε atom of His41. Lastly, in the deacylation process, the bond between the M Pro and the substrate is broken by hydrolysis that enables the enzyme to participate in a new catalytic cycle [29] . Regarding the first step of the reaction, the distance between the histidine nitrogen atom (Nε) and the cysteine sulfur (Sγ) was calculated to check its variability in the set of structures generated along the normal modes considered. The CHARMM program was used to calculate the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) for the set of structures generated along the normal modes. We have reported the SASA values to the entire protein (SASAt -total), hydrophobic residues (SASAhp), dimeric interface residues (SASAdim), substrate binding site residues (SASAsb), His41 and Cys145 residue. The lowest frequency normal modes calculated for WT and mutants of SARS- Comparisons between the movements of the WT and the chosen mutants of SARS-CoV-2 M pro were performed using the protocol described in the Mantel test. In this protocol described by Louet et al. [29] , motions in 3D space were analyzed by calculating 2D matrices, exchanging the relative displacements of all pairs of Cα atoms between two structures [30, 31] . Briefly, the method consisted of calculating 2D matrices reflecting the relative displacements of all pairs of Cα atoms between two structures. For each mode, these matrices were calculated from the two structures obtained at a displacement amplitude of 1.0 Å in each direction. The correlation coefficients between two matrices were then calculated with Mantel's test [30] . With this method, it was assumed that two 2D maps sharing a correlation coefficient greater than 0.6 described highly related motions in cartesian space. The RMSF arithmetic average was calculated for each analyzed region (N- The data obtained related to the potential energy, distance between the catalytic dyad atoms (Cys145, His41), and SASA from (i) binding site, (ii) hydrophobic residues, (iii) dimer interface residues, and (iv) total molecular surface were compared between the 48 mutants and WT of SARS-CoV-2 M pro using ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) followed by Dunnett's test (with significance at p ≤ 0.05). All statistical analyzes were performed using the multcomp package of ANOVA [32] implemented by R-Studio package [33] . The Heatmap, Violin and Boxplot representations were generated in Python using the Pandas [34, 35] , NumPy [36] , Matplotlib [37] and Seaborn [38] libraries. We used the PDBe PISA (Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies) to investigate the interactions in the dimer interface for the WT and those mutants of SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Using the PISA web server, we calculate the solvation free energy gain upon formation of the interface, interface area and number of potential hydrogen bonds and salt bridge [39] . Complementary to the PISA results, we applied the TKSA-MC [40] to estimate the contribution of electrostatic interaction to free energy for the polar residues, especially those that are localized in the interface of the dimer (Arg4, Glu14, Glu240 and Arg298). The TKSA-MC calculates protein charge-charge interactions via the Tanford-Kirkwood Surface Accessibility model with the Monte Carlo method for sampling different protein protonation states. We used these two softwares to improve the discussion about the stability of the dimer for 4 mutants showing significant SASA and Potential Energy reduction (see Table 2 ). Several works have reported variants of SARS-CoV-2 with mutations in different regions of M pro and their effect on its functionality [5, 17] . Thereby, in this [17] and SARS-CoVM pro [41] as well as NMA calculation for HIV-1 protease [42] and DPP-IV diabetes related protein [43] . Thus, this analysis indicated that some mutants may present characteristics that can influence their catalytic activity, substrate binding affinity and/or dimer stability, as also shown previously by Amamuddy et al. (2020) [17] .  Up to now, the solved crystallographic structures of M pro molecules from coronavirus indicate they are structurally very similar and basically dimeric. The M pro protomers from coronavirus consists of three well-characterized domains, being two with a chymotrypsin fold and a third extra helix domain, which is essential for dimerization of this viral protease [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . Also, since the mid 2000s, a series of scientific works has confirmed that the dimerization process is fundamental to the full catalytic activity of the main proteases from coronavirus [5] . Hence, it is reasonable to suppose that the combination of low levels of potential energy, lesser SASA values and larger dimeric interfaces could favor the protein stabilization and, in the specific case of the mutants of SARS-CoV-2 M pro , to affect the activity of these enzymes. About this issue, Hu et al. (2009) [49] showed that two specific and neighbouring mutations at the SARS-CoV-1 M pro dimeric interface lead this molecule to assume distinct oligomeric conformations. In fact, this work concluded that certain key amino acid residues control the SARS-CoV-1 M pro dimerization and also suggested the dimeric stability of this protease is heavily dependent on the extent and integrity of the contacts between the Thus, these mutants of SARS-CoV-2 M pro were carefully examined to assess their differences to the WT SARS-CoV-2 M pro , particularly those related to the dimeric interfaces and the influence of the K90R, P99L, P108S, and N151D amino acid substitutions in the conformational space accessed by the mutant molecules. The PDBePISA web server indicated that some calculated K90R and N151D mutant structures presented a higher dimeric interface contribution to the total solvation free energy (Δ i G) not including the effect of satisfied hydrogen bonds and salt bridges across the interface) in relation to the wild-type molecule and the other mutants ( Figure   3A ). Therefore, at least these two mutants are able to assume oligomeric conformations which are kept by a dimeric interface more hydrophobic than the remaining wild-type and mutant structures generated by the computed normal mode displacements. On the other hand, as shown in Figure 3A , there is a visible concentration of wild-type molecules which reach Δ i G values around -11.0 kcal/mol whereas the calculated mut SARS-CoV-2 M pro structures showed mostly higher Δ i G values. Hence, the K90R, P99L, P108S, and N151D mutants can also form, with a higher probability, dimeric interfaces which offer a lesser hydrophobic contribution to the Δ i G in comparison to the WT SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Indeed, the Figure 3C indicates the K90R, P99L, P108S, and N151D mutants can potentially establish at their dimeric interfaces a higher number of hydrogen bonds than the wild-type protease, indicating thus the formation of more stable and specific contacts between the protomers. An example regarding this difference between the wild-type and mutant calculated structures is the influence of the mutation P99L. In this case, it was possible to generate a dimer presenting approximately ten hydrogen bonds at the interface more than the wild-type calculated structure with the highest number of hydrogen bonds connecting its monomers. Moreover, according to the TKSA-MC server [40] , the electrostatic contribution to the total free energy (ΔGqq) of four amino acid residues present at the mut SARS-CoV-2 M pro dimeric interfaces (residues) considering both protease chains was clearly distinct. As shown in Figure S10  It is well known that some amino acid residues are essential to the dimerization and activity of the main proteases from SARS-CoV-1. In this work, the authors found the Ser10 and Glu14 residues located at SARS-CoV-1 M pro domain I are crucial to the formation of interface interactions, being highly conserved in several coronavirus main proteases. Additionally, [54] reported that the amino acid substitution G11A led to a total monomer separation after crystallization of this mutant SARS-CoV-1. Next, Shi et al. (2008) [55] showed that the SARS-CoV-1 M pro R298A mutation produced crystals with monomeric molecules. In this study, the authors highlighted that Arg298 is a key amino acid residue involved in the dimerization of this protease. Remarkably (Table S1 ). As shown in Figure 4 , some of the calculated K90R, P99L, P108S, and N151D mutant structures were able to reach catalytic dyad distances below 4.0 Å. Therefore, these results indicated the proposed protocol involving displacement of the initial wild-type and mutant structures generated molecules with a catalytic dyad geometry prone to trigger the substrate catalysis. Figure S11 ). Thus, the results shown here point to some hints that could help to identify eventual differences between the action mechanism of wild-type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 M pro molecules. As highlighted by Goyal and Goyal (2020) several works have been based on the design of substrate binding pocket-ligands to inhibit the SARS-CoV-1 M pro , but none of them has reached clinical trials to date. Thus, a good therapeutic alternative to fight against SARS-CoV-2 could be to target the dimerization of its main protease. In this work, the importance of this process for SARS-CoV-2 M pro is strengthened by the evident influence of surface mutations on the oligomeric conformation of this essential viral protease and, probably, to its molecular evolution and adaptation. Finally, the results shown here may also help to identify factors related to the emergence of more pathogenic or transmissible viral types. The authors declare no conflict of interest. Table 1 . The WT SARS-CoV-2 M pro measure is highlighted by a red rectangle. @story_separate@This work compared the WT and mutants of SARS-CoV-2 M pro using a normal modes-based protocol involving the analysis of simple parameters as Cα flexibility, potential energy, hydrophobic and electrostatic contributions to free energy, solvent accessible surface areas, and catalytic dyad distance. These parameters allowed the selection of potential structurally stable dimers, which were posteriorly analyzed and remarkably showed that single surface amino acid substitutions are able to induce significant dimeric interface changes. Also, the mutants showed a low conservation of collective motions in relation to the wild-type molecule according to the Mantel test. Additionally, the K90R, P99L, P108S, and N151D mutants presented modes with different probabilities of generating conformers with catalytic dyad prone to trigger the catalysis reaction in comparison to the wild-type protease. Therefore, this finding allowed us to suppose the mutants could present a distinct functionality in relation to the original SARS-CoV-2 M pro .","The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (called Mpro or 3CLpro) is essential for processing polyproteins encoded by viral RNA. Macromolecules adopt several favored conformations in solution depending on their structure and shape, determining their dynamics and function. Integrated methods combining the lowest-frequency movements obtained by Normal Mode Analysis (NMA), and the faster movements from Molecular Dynamics (MD), and data from biophysical techniques, are necessary to establish the correlation between complex structural dynamics of macromolecules and their function. In this article, we used a hybrid simulation method to sample the conformational space to characterize the structural dynamics and global motions of WT SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and 48 mutants, including several mutations that appear in P.1, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.525 and B.1.429+B.1.427 variants. Integrated Hybrid methods combining NMA and MD have been useful to study the correlation between the complex structural dynamics of macromolecules and their functioning mechanisms. Here, we applied this hybrid approach to elucidate the effects of mutation in the structural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, considering their flexibility, solvent accessible surface area analyses, global movements, and catalytic dyad distance. Furthermore, some mutants showed significant changes in their structural dynamics and conformation, which could lead to distinct functional properties. Highlights Single surface mutations lead to changes in Mpro structural dynamics. Mutants can be more stable than WT according to the structural dynamics properties. Mpromutants can present a distinct functionality in relation to the wild-type. Potential viral markers for more pathogenic or transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants."
"London's population of approximately 9 M is served by 4 Level-1 Major Trauma Centres (MTCs) with surrounding trauma networks of Level-2 community centres [1] . These 4 hospitals were the first in the UK to admit large numbers of seriously ill patients affected by COVID-19 infections. Although major incident protocols are well-rehearsed at Level-1 MTCs, the challenges posed by COVID-19 have been very different. London is unfortunately accustomed to terrorist attacks, triggering short-lived mass-casualty major incidents where all resources are directed towards the provision of trauma care [2] . Recently, this traditional model of the 'major incident' has been redefined, with trauma services becoming marginalised to prioritise treatment for patients with viral pneumonia. Major operational changes increased capacity for medical and intensive care while downscaling capacity for major trauma-the polar opposite response to the mass casualty scenario that we prepare for. The resulting reconfiguration has had dramatic effects on normal healthcare provision. Very few aspects of the patient journey or health workers' roles have remained unaffected but many of the adaptations have already become established practice, with transformative service change emerging. In this article we reflect on the changes introduced and the lessons learned at London's four Level-1 Major Trauma Centres, in maintaining a reduced but functional service for trauma and urgent musculoskeletal pathology, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.@story_separate@Reconfiguration of the trauma service was the first critical element. Each centre adapted individually but the problems faced were identical; continuing to provide high quality sub-specialist orthopaedic and trauma care on the unstable platform of inevitable staff illness, redeployment and concerns around safety. We anticipated that up to 30% of our workforce may be infected and confined to self-isolation at any given time [3] . There were many common themes between centres and, as ever, high-level leadership and clear communication were often the hardest elements to get right [4] . The workforce was reorganised into smaller teams each with designated leaders and with a full spectrum of subspecialties represented (pelvis, upper/lower-limb etc.). Daily managerial and clinical decision-making could be shared among highly visible and readily available leaders at ground level. Senior leaders were then allowed to focus Co-first authors: Ramon Tahmassebi and Peter Bates. on strategic responsibilities. Smaller teams allowed agile, senior led responses, particularly in the polytrauma situation. It also allowed movement between teams in the event of staff absence, along with recovery time after periods of deployment. High infection rates within healthcare highlighted the vulnerability of the workforce [5] . Colleagues considered 'high risk' due to medical co-morbidities who had been advised to stay away from patient-facing duties were well-utilised. They provided off-site support in terms of rota co-ordination, communication with satellite hospitals and virtual outpatient consultations, a critical part of shutting down elective services. The actual staff sickness rate was much lower than expected and was, on average, closer to 10% at any given time. Despite delayed introduction, the availability of COVID-19 testing for staff and family numbers made a positive impact on staff retention, although the lack of test reliability has subsequently eroded this confidence [6] . Overall, social lockdown measures dramatically reduced trauma numbers allowing safe, effective major (and minor) trauma services to be maintained despite resource limitations. The traditional morning trauma meeting remained pivotal to the efficient and coordinated delivery of reconfigured services. However, the emerging situation enabled instigation of new modes of communication that would previously have seemed too disruptive to apply and embed. During the first weeks of the pandemic there was a deluge of information from a variety of governing bodies, which was often inconsistent and prompted confusion. Guidance was provided/updated on a daily and sometimes hourly basis, giving steer on everything from clinical decision-making, risk stratification and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). These constantly shifting sands made it difficult for clinicians to remain up-to-date and well informed. This was amplified by local variations of how guidelines were interpreted, something that often did not resonate with front-line clinicians [7] . The importance of clear, well considered, centrally driven directives cannot be overstated in any crisis and hospital leadership consistently struggled to support guidance from governing bodies with the real-time feedback from clinicians at ground level. In the initial phase of rapid change, this juxtaposition of conflicting advice (central vs on-the-ground) was difficult to manage and presented a major source of anxiety. Clinical teams often became dispersed to meet the demands of operating theatres, wards, out-patient clinics and the ED. Staff members working at home also needed to be kept abreast of developments in the hospital, both for their general awareness and their input towards clinical MDT decision-making. Moreover, it felt crucial for everyone to remain feeling engaged, included and appreciated within the team. Side-to-side communications also included contact and coordination with partners in other specialties internally, as well as networked hospitals outside. Concerns around patient confidentially with instant messaging apps were addressed at national level, where their use was sanctioned [8] . Around the hospital, their use became ubiquitous, allowing rapid dissemination of information within groups. However, negative elements of these social platforms also blossomed, as useful constructive information circulated alongside rumours, 'fake news' and conspiracies, with minimal discrimination between them [9] . Clinicians were presented with swathes of documents with no peer review or sense of authenticity, which had a destabilising effect when trying to instigate plans. Humorous posts and angry outbursts were aired over the same channels as important updates, which clouded the sharing of genuinely important information. Only once a sense of responsibility and a level of self-discipline around social media behaviour was established, could the value of real-time electronic communication be maximised. All centres rapidly introduced virtual meeting software and staff adapted well to its use. Platforms such as Zoom, Gotomeeting and Microsoft Teams were widely adopted [10]. This enforced transition has opened our eyes to embracing remote communication and incorporating it into ongoing daily practice; a classic example of beneficial service transformation arising from a disruptive and unsettling event [11] . The 4 hospitals quickly became COVID-19 hotspots, forcing us to critically appraise out-patient practices. To minimise risks, it was essential to distance patients from hospital unless physical attendance was absolutely necessary. Telephone clinics replaced face-to-face interactions, except those where remote consultations would fall short. Predictably, many patients could be willingly postponed or even discharged by telephone, seemingly confirming that traditional practice around out-patient follow-up is outdated and open to modernisation [12] . Our anecdotal experience reflects previous reports that telephone or videoconference consultations are not quicker, but the patient-experience seems preferable in some cases, compared to attending hospital [13, 14] . Anaesthetic staff redeployments and reconfiguration of operating theatres placed heavy constraints on surgical capacity. Consequently, there was an almost immediate postponement of all non-urgent elective surgery with no indication of when this work might resume [15] . The concern was that capacity would be downgraded so severely we would be forced to completely reconsider thresholds for trauma surgery. The British Orthopaedic Association encouraged us to consider amending our usual practices and apply non-operative treatments where feasible [16] . The downside of this conservative approach would be potential late displacement of fractures leading to malunions/nonunions, requiring months of post-COVID reconstructions. Fortunately, this did not materialise as societal lockdown led to a dramatic reduction in trauma volumes. This allowed risk-stratified surgical care to those who needed it, despite the heavily constrained access to surgery. In the event, poor reductions were rarely accepted unless the patient was highrisk for an adverse outcome with COVID-19 infection. Our reluctance to recommend surgery was easily matched by reluctance of the public to undergo surgery. Restricted operating room access reinforced the need for definitive single-stage surgery wherever possible and plastic surgery for soft tissue defects moved from free-flap reconstruction (requiring long operative times) to local flaps. Early amputation for severe mangled limb trauma was more favourably weighted against limb salvage, potentially requiring multiple operations and prolonged inpatient stays [17] . Early weight bearing was encouraged to facilitate rapid discharge and minimise viral exposure [18, 19] . Operating rooms were refashioned as extensions to critical care, with ventilators redistributed accordingly resulting in 50-75% reduction in operating capacity across all MTCs. Anaesthetic colleagues were redeployed to ICU for their airway skills and established surgical teams were broken up [20] . In addition, infection control measures have strongly diminished efficiency and turnover. Despite efforts to streamline processes, there are no shortcuts when it comes to safety of staff and patients. Adjustments to anaesthetic protocols and donning/doffing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) have led to a downturn in productivity [20] . Unfortunately, COVID-19 will continue to be a major influence in all our activity for the foreseeable future and while the threat still exists, this reduced theatre efficiency may become the new norm, negatively impacting each hospital's ability to revamp elective surgery services. We will undoubtedly need to consider innovative ways of addressing the huge backlog of elective work that has accrued [21] . The impact of COVID-19 on training has been profound in all specialties but particularly in surgery. All 4 institutions have large resident programmes but training opportunities have become scant. The need to keeping surgical times to a minimum, along with the cessation of elective surgery has slowed progress for all trainees and fellows, and for many, prolonged their period of residency by 6-months or more [22] . Aside from managing all polytrauma, the UK's MTCs provide support to their network hospitals in treating highenergy complex fractures [23] . These referral pathways became strained as inter-hospital transfers were minimised, which forced regional hospitals to take-on higher-energy injuries, having lost the referral option to the hub [24] . Again, electronic meeting platforms allowed for case discussions, advice and support. Often, pragmatic temporising measures were encouraged, rather than complex fracture reconstructions, to minimise difficult late reconstructions. Much attention has been paid to the physical wellbeing of health workers and their vulnerability to infection. Outside of those physicians working on the genuine front-line of caring for COVID patients (ED, ICU, Medicine, Anaesthetics, etc.), there has traditionally been less focus on the psychological health of the workforce; particularly in surgery. However, secondary psychosocial effects have permeated the hospital workforce at large and it is impossible to estimate how this may have affected judgement and performance as clinicians [25] . Trainees have seen logbook entries, job prospects and fellowships evaporate. Career uncertainty prevails for many and the threat of redeployment to unfamiliar environments has remained a destabilising influence. Arguably the biggest generator of anxiety has been the use and availability of PPE. As guidelines evolved, an unfortunate sense of mistrust emerged, fuelled by social media, as many perceived the updates were a reflection of poor planning and limited availability rather than a gold standard of protection [26] . Personal concerns around family members, social isolation, home schooling and financial worries have compounded this. Reassuringly, our hospitals have shown unprecedented willingness to engage in wellbeing initiatives to support staff. Examples include free staff yoga/Pilates classes; morning meditation and wellbeing sessions for staff; free food donations welcomed from outside charities; volunteer wellbeing officers (clinicians with a personal interest) being identified and offering advice and useful contacts to colleagues; assignment of designated rest areas and staff chillout zones; handouts and posters encouraging staff debriefs and offering opportunities to talk and share. Staff wellbeing now feels like a priority in many hospitals with psychological problems no longer seen as a sign of weakness but as a treatable (and sometimes preventable) condition.@story_separate@The COVID-19 pandemic has forced trauma services to adapt and evolve in ways that we had not previously envisaged. Emerging from the first wave, there is a sense of relief, but cautious optimism is diluted by the threat of future outbreaks. The full extent of COVID-19 will not be apparent for some time but the experiences of the past 3 months have transformed our understanding of how to cope with what lies ahead. We have already embedded many new ways of working into our normal practice, which will persist long beyond this pandemic.",Emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in dramatic changes in global healthcare provision. Resources were redirected across all healthcare sectors to support the treatment of viral pneumonia with resultant effects on other essential services. We describe the impact of this on the provision of major trauma care in a major capital city.
"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic disease where antibodies against the molecular complex of heparin-to-platelet factor 4 (PF4/H) interact with platelet receptors to promote platelet activation, aggregation, and removal from circulation [1, 2•]. PF4 is secreted by platelet granules or displaced from the endothelium. HIT antibodies against the heparin/PF4 complex will trigger downstream thrombin generation and catastrophic thrombus formation. The prevalence of HIT is rare in both medical and surgical patients, and the incidence in most population-based studies ranges between 0.3 and 3.0%. However, the occurrence of HIT in the operating theater or the postoperative critical care setting can be swift and devastating. In this review, we will discuss standard definitions, scoring systems, epidemiology, and pathogenesis that is relevant to the perioperative and critical care environments. For our review, we will be referring to the type 2 variety of HIT, where an immune-mediated disorder emerges typically 4-10 days after heparin exposure to heparin and has life-and limb-threatening thrombotic complications [2•, 3]. There will be a limited focus on the less clinically important type 1, which is a non-immune process that presents within the first 2 days after heparin exposure with correction of thrombocytopenia despite continuation of heparin therapy [3] .@story_separate@Approximately 20-50% of critically ill patients present with thrombocytopenia in the intensive care unit (ICU), whereby a reduced platelet count below 150,000 platelets per microliter of blood is noted on laboratory testing [4] . Heparinoid exposure by syringe flush, subcutaneous prophylaxis, or therapeutic anticoagulation is common in the operative room (OR) and ICU environments [5] .Only a fraction of those with low platelet counts will develop HIT, which presents in approximately 0.3-0.5% of critically ill patients exposed to heparin [6] . These statistics suggest that around 1 in 100 ICU patients will develop thrombocytopenia due to HIT [1, 4, 7] . HIT is paradoxically linked to a high risk for arterial and venous thromboses. Almost half of the critically ill patients diagnosed with HIT will present with thrombotic events [5, 8] . HIT presents in the setting of higher concentrations of platelet factor 4 (PF4) leading to the formation of PF4/H complexes. Surgery can trigger the release of massive amounts of PF4 [9] . Therefore, the frequency of HIT varies with the type of surgery. Five percent of orthopedic surgical patients exposed to heparin for 10-14 days present with HIT [10] [11] [12] . Shorter courses of heparin treatment seem to decrease the risk of HIT development [13] . Preferential use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as opposed to unfractionated heparin (UFH) is associated with lower rates of HIT [14• ]. In cardiac surgery patients, the frequency of HIT is approximately 2% [15, 16•] . Although HIT is less frequent in cardiac surgical patients compared with orthopedic patients, cardiac surgical patients have a higher frequency of HIT immunization (positive antibody formation) [15] , potentially due to the high intraoperative UFH doses required for anticoagulation on cardiopulmonary bypass [7, 17] . HIT presents in trauma patients with a frequency of around 2.2% [18] . Patients with major trauma showed higher rates of seroconversion compared with patients with minor trauma (OR 7.98 [95% CI 2.06-31.00]; P = 0.003). In these patients, HIT incidence was lower when using LMWH versus UFH, although the difference was not statistically significant (LMWH 1.3% vs. UFH 0.3%; P = 0.37). HIT occurs more frequently in surgical patients compared with medical patients [19, 20] . Medical patients present a HIT prevalence of around 0.8-2.0% [20, 21] . Gender seems to be a risk factor for HIT and females are more affected than men (OR, 9.22 vs. 1.83; P = .020) [19] . HIT is uncommon in obstetric patients [22] . The type of heparin used is a well-described risk factor for HIT. A small study with patients undergoing first-time CABG reported a seroconversion rate of 44.4% for bovine heparin and 30.6% for porcine heparin. Intraoperatively, bovine heparin is less frequently used compared with porcine heparin, and in the setting of HIT, both should be avoided [23] . Unfractionated heparin has been significantly associated with a higher incidence of HIT (almost 10fold higher), [2•] compared with LMWH and selective factor Xa inhibitors like fondaparinux [9, 18, 19, 24] likely due to the difference of the polysaccharide chain lengths and the degree of sulfation of each medication [25] . Of importance, dosing seems to be correlated to the risk of developing HIT. Prophylactic UFH is more frequently associated with HIT compared with therapeutic UFH, due to the fluctuations in the PF4/H ratio. LMWH and fondaparinux are less likely to form multimolecular complexes with PF4 and, consequently, less likely to induce HIT. The variability in the reported frequency of HIT is due to the multiple factors. Differences in the studied populations (medical vs. surgical) [15] , type of heparin used [9, 24] , duration of therapy, [10] and female over-representation [19] have been strongly correlated with such variability. Other limitations of the studies include selection bias, inconsistency in the definitions used for thrombocytopenia and HIT, discrepancy/ inconsistency of tests performed for confirmation, and differences in baseline patient characteristics (including baseline platelet counts, inclusion of patients with early thrombocytopenia, and the failure to exclude patient whose platelet counts recovered during continue heparin treatment) [19, [26] [27] [28] . In the ICU, exposure to UFH occurs from flushes and heparin-bonded devices. Although rare, Swan-Ganz catheters and extracorporeal circuits may be heparin coated to avoid thrombus formation during routine standard use. Even minor heparin exposures can elicit the formation of HIT antibodies [29] , but not all antibodies will trigger the development of HIT. The estimated frequency of catheter-associated HIT is around 0.4% [30] . Patients with central catheters and HIT antibodies are at a higher risk for both upper-extremity and lower-extremity DVT occurring at the catheter site [31] . The larger devices (i.e., VAD, ECMO, intra-aortic balloon pump) require high doses of systemic UFH, increasing the risk of seroconversion and clinically apparent HIT. Interestingly, the incidence of HIT in this population is around 8% [32] , while the rate of seroconversion by immunoassay has been reported between 25 and 75% [15, 32, 33] . Such a wide range depends on the criteria used to define HIT, the populations included, and the difference in confirmatory tests used for diagnosis. The binding specificity of heparin is determined by its negative charge, molecular size, molecular weight, and chain length [34••] . Heparin binding to the platelet surface can trigger the release of PF4, a positively charged chemokine secreted from the α granules of activated platelets [35] . PF4 readily binds negatively charged proteins on the endothelium and also to soluble proteins such as heparin [36] . Excess PF4 binding can alter the usual configuration of the endothelial proteins, expressing new antigens and inducing an immune response [34••, 37] . To be immunogenic, the PF4-heparin complexes must be soluble and sizable [25] to interact with the Fc γ receptors present on platelets and monocytes [38] . As a result of this interaction, these cells are activated and potentiate thrombin generation. In HIT, high-affinity IgG antibodies are produced soon after heparin exposure along with IgA and IgM antibodies [39] . In contrast to other conditions, HIT does not present with an initial IgM phase [40] . This rapid response with IgG might be related to exposure early in life to bacteria or host cells with PF4 bound to surface polyanions [41, 42] . Repeated exposure to heparin does not necessarily lead to recurrent episodes of HIT (e.g., non-anamnestic), suggesting that these antibodies disappear within a short time [43] [44] [45] due to a lack of a robust increase in memory B-cells [45, 46] . The fine balance between molar concentrations of PF4 relative to heparin determines the immune response in HIT. Molar concentrations where one component exceeds the other will promote the formation of complexes that are nonimmunogenic and that will not be favorable for platelet binding [15, 25, 42] . This may explain why seropositive HIT does not necessarily translate to clinically apparent HIT. The immunogenic ultralarge PF4-heparin complexes form in the presence of a 1:1 M ratio. The optimal concentration of PF4 needed to shift antigenicity to higher levels seems to be related to heparin dosing in the setting of platelet activation (i.e., surgery, trauma, diabetes, inflammation, etc.) [42] . Patients exposed intraoperatively to very high doses of heparin (e.g., cardiovascular surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass), where there is more heparin compared to PF4, are less likely to develop HIT [25] . Conversely, standard postoperative doses (e.g., orthopedic surgery) seem to produce a more favorable PF4/heparin ratio for clinically significant HIT [15] . HIT antibodies can develop even in the absence of heparin exposure, suggesting the presence of a group of B-cells that are triggered by inflammation and lack of immune regulation [47, 48] . Although rare, spontaneous or autoimmune HIT can occur through the binding of PF4 to other major anionic proteins including nucleic acids and bacterial lipopolysaccharides [41, 49] . Thrombocytopenia from autoimmune HIT may persist for weeks, even after the initiation of an alternative drug for anticoagulation [50] . HIT is characterized by thrombocytopenia or a fall of more than 50% in the baseline platelet count measured after surgery [11] . Around 85-90% of the patients diagnosed with HIT present with thrombocytopenia [51] . Thrombocytopenia (or the 50% fall in the platelet count) classically starts between 4 and 10 days of heparin exposure and more commonly between 6 and 15 days after the first heparin exposure in more than 90% of the patients with HIT [52] . By several reports, the platelet count reaches nadir values by day 8 and the first evidence of thrombosis usually starts by day 10. Some patients develop thrombocytopenia earlier (within 2 days of exposure), but those patients have usually been exposed to heparin before, typically within 2-3 weeks, yet sometimes within 100 days before heparin re-exposure [45, 50] . Thrombosis is common in HIT patients. It is estimated that around 50% of patients diagnosed with HIT in the postoperative period will present with thrombotic complications that might be a threat to life and/or limb [2•]. Venous thromboembolic disease, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus, is more common than arterial thrombosis (two-fourfold higher), particularly in surgical patients [53] . Patients with vascular disease are an exception as they tend to have similar rates of venous and arterial thrombosis in the setting of HIT [54] . Arterial thrombosis is also common in cardiac surgery patients [55] . In vascular patients, postoperative HIT is associated with longer hospitalizations, higher cost of stay, and higher rates of non-routine home discharges [56] . Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs with a range of incidence between 17 and 55% in postsurgical cardiac, orthopedic, oncologic, and neurosurgical patients [53, 57] . If HIT goes untreated, then the frequency of thrombosis increases by 6.1% each day until cessation of heparin and the initiation of alternative anticoagulant therapy [58] . Other manifestations that may present with seropositive HIT include necrotizing skin lesions at heparin injection sites [59, 60] , adrenal vein thrombosis with hemorrhagic necrosis [61] , cavernous sinus thrombosis [62] , acute systemic reactions within 30 min of an intravenous heparin bolus injection [60] , and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [63] [64] [65] [66] . DIC is perhaps the most feared complication if it were to occur along with a HIT diagnosis because clinical manifestations may be similar and the presence of DIC may often suggest HIT has progressed from localized thrombus formation to a systemic thromboinflammatory response [67] . Multiple scoring systems can be used for HIT probability estimation. Only the 4 T score (4Ts) has been validated. The 4Ts comprises four variables evaluated and scored from 0 to 2 ( Table 1 ). The positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values for this score were assessed in a pooled analysis from 2012 that included approximately 3000 patients. A low score (0-3) has a NPV 0.99 [95% CI, 0.99-1.00], which essentially rules out HIT. An intermediate score (4) (5) has a PPV of 0.48 [95% CI 0.42-0.55], and a high score (6-8) has a PPV of 0.12 [95% CI 0.10-0.14]. Intermediate and high scores are not as reliable as only 48% of the patients with an intermediate score and 12% of patients with a high score will be accurately diagnosed with HIT with these criteria [6, 17, 68] . The HIT expert probability score (HEP score) was developed according to expert opinion to offer another option for guiding clinical decision making, as previous scores had limited predictive capacities [69] . The score showed good agreement with the serotonin release assay, but greater interobserver variability. However, the predictive values were not different than the 4 Ts' score (positive predictive value of 0.55 (95% CI 0.25-0.82) and a negative predictive value of 0.97 [95% CI 0.85-1.00] for a cutoff > 5). This score has not been prospectively validated. The Lillo-Le Louët model [70] is intended for estimation of the likelihood of HIT in patients following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for cardiac surgery. A low score (< 2) suggests a low probability of HIT, while a high score (≥2) is associated with a high probability. The negative predictive value of this model was comparable with both the HEP and 4 T scores (9 7% ), but this model has not been prospectively validated. HIT is a challenging diagnosis in the ICU setting. Critically ill patients can often present with thrombocytopenia resulting from diagnoses other than HIT. The timing of thrombocytopenia is tremendously helpful in the diagnosis. The etiology of platelet depletion can be classified as consumptive and destructive (Table 2) . HIT is a challenging clinical diagnosis as critically ill patients often present thrombocytopenia and are almost ubiquitously exposed to heparin. There are two varieties of laboratory tests for HIT: Immunoassays (ELISA, IgG) and functional assays (serotonin release assay-SRA, heparin-induced platelet activation-HIPA) [85] . Immunoassays detect anti-PF4/H antibodies (platelet-activating and non-activating) and have high sensitivity (> 95%) but low specificity (i.e., high rate of false positives) [12, 15, 19] . These tests are widely available. Enzyme immunoassays (EIA) identify antibody presence by days 4-5 reaching maximum reactivity on days 10-12 [40] . These assays use a solid surface with heparin coating to which the patient's plasma is added. Antibody isotypes are measured using a combination of anti-immunoglobulins (Anti-IgG, -IgM, and IgA) or a single isotype (Anti-IgG) [66] . The main limitation of EIAs in HIT is the detection of antibodies that are not necessarily pathogenic (e.g., IgM and IgA antibodies). IgG-focused EIAs seem to be more specific but are likewise limited for identification of clinically relevant HIT antibodies [2•, 26]. Immunization (presence of PF4/H antibodies) does not necessarily mean the development of a clinical picture of HIT. In fact, seroconversion (or immunization) occurs frequently without thrombocytopenia or thrombosis [86] . A patient with a low pretest probability of HIT and a positive EIA requires confirmation with a functional assay [2•, 87, 88••]. The goal is to avoid over-diagnosis and over-treatment. A positive EIA does not automatically translate into a HIT diagnosis. Polyclonal immunoassays that detect IgA, IgM, and IgG isotypes can result in false positives for HIT, even when there are no clinical symptoms [89] . It is generally recommended to not pursue said test unless there is a high clinical suspicion of HIT. Treatment based on such results may be unnecessary and potentially harmful [90] . IgG-specific assays are more promising, but cutoffs for optical densities (OD) for HIT have not been clearly defined. OD values are arbitrary units and vary among laboratories Curr Anesthesiol Rep [91] . Strongly reactive ODs (more than 1.0) are usually correlated with clinically apparent HIT [27, 28] . High ODs are also associated with positive functional assays [27, 28] . Functional assays (i.e., SRA, HIPA) detect plateletactivating anti-PF4/H antibodies and have high specificity (80-100%) [92] but restricted availability due to technical requirements (i.e., require human platelets from known reactive donors, use of radioactive compounds) [92, 93] . SRA only detects antibodies that are capable of activating platelets and can detect antibodies by day 5 after heparin initiation [12] . The proportion of immunized patients who develop HIT is highest among the patients who have a positive SRA [94] . Titers of PF4/H antibodies decrease by 3-4 months [45] . These patients are still at risk for developing rapid-onset HIT on heparin re-exposure during this period unless the functional assays/EIA are negative [87] . HIT treatments aim to reduce thrombin generation, treat any thrombotic events, and interrupt platelet activation triggered by heparin. The mainstay of HIT treatment is the cessation of all forms of heparin and initiation of alternative anticoagulation (Fig. 1) . Vitamin K antagonists should be avoided until HIT has resolved and the platelet count has recovered and plateaued. This is due to the increased risk of venous limb gangrene and limb loss with the inhibition of Protein C [2•]. There are options for alternative anticoagulation. Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI), including argatroban, lepirudin, and bivalirudin, inhibit both free and clot-bound thrombin facilitating the action of antithrombin, preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and preventing the activation of factor XIII [95] . The inhibition is selective and reversible for argatroban and bivalirudin. These drugs have a short half-life (less than 2 h) and are monitored by PTT. However, there is a risk for falsely supratherapeutic PTT in the setting of coagulopathy (e.g., DIC, decreased liver function) leading to DTI underdosing [63] [64] [65] . DTIs (particularly argatroban) increase INR values and interfere with the protein C pathway [95] , so transitioning to warfarin requires specific protocols with an overlap of the two drugs for 5 days to maintain an INR > 4 [16•, 87] . Argatroban is useful for patients with renal insufficiency due to its hepatobiliary excretion [4] and requires parenteral administration. Lepirudin has to be monitored by [78, 79] Pulmonary embolism [80] Liver failure [81••] Diabetic ketoacidosis [82] Lupus/antiphospholipid syndrome [76] Cancer (mucin-producing adenocarcinomas) [83] c COVID-19 [77] a Antibodies that recognize GPIIb/IIIa in the presence of the provoking drug can cross-react with platelet-activating receptors [74] b Postoperative thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is due to abnormality on the clearance of ultralarge vWF multimers released from endothelium leads to increased platelet consumption [84] and severe thrombocytopenia (< 20 × 10 9 /L) [72••] c At the time of this composition, the exact mechanisms for COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability and thrombocytopenia are yet to be elucidated. The current prevailing conceptual framework involves dysregulated endothelial inflammation and upregulation of thrombin generation [77] ecarin clotting time (ECT) during cardiopulmonary bypass and with unexpected bleeding [96] . Bivalirudin is a better option for cardiac surgery as it has a quick onset and short half-life and can be monitored with the activated clotting time (ACT) (Fig. 1) . However, bivalirudin carries a risk for excessive bleeding as there is no specific reversal agent available to date. Monitoring its effect can be challenging due to a lack of standardized methods. Currently, ACT or aPTT are used as surrogates of the degree of anticoagulation. For surgeries that require the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, stagnant blood should be avoided at all times due to the increased risk of clotting as bivalirudin is cleaved by thrombin [97, 98] . Bivalirudin metabolism and clearance can be unpredictable with changes in renal function, core temperature, or repeated doses during a long procedure [99] . Indirect thrombin inhibitors (danaparoid, fondaparinux) work by enhancing the anti-Xa activity of antithrombin III. Danaparoid is not available in the USA since 2002, but it is available in other countries. Fondaparinux has a long half-life (17 h), requires monitoring with anti-Xa levels, has no effect on INR, and does not interfere with the activation of the protein C pathway [100] . These drugs undergo renal excretion [24, 101] and subcutaneously administered. Both direct and indirect thrombin inhibitors lack a reversal agent. Platelet transfusions are not indicated in HIT unless the patient has uncontrolled hemorrhage or is undergoing an invasive procedure as it increases the risk of thrombosis [102] . IVC filters are also relatively contraindicated in HIT as there is an increased risk of IVC thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and limb ischemia [103] . HIT patients with thrombosis or a moderate-high pretest probability should be started on a non-heparin anticoagulant while awaiting the results of confirmatory testing. These patients will require therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 months [2•]. Patients with a strong suspicion of isolated HIT or with a confirmed diagnosis should receive therapeutic dose anticoagulation with a non-heparin alternative. The treatment should be continued until platelets recover to a stable plateau [104] . The risk of major bleeding with a DTI for HIT is around 1% for lepirudin (mean treatment period: 14 days) and 0.6-1% for argatroban (mean treatment period: 5 days). Patients with a 4 T score of equal or less than 3 that do not have a reason for therapeutic dose anticoagulation should continue prophylactic treatment with heparin or an alternative [87] . Patients with an intermediate probability (4Ts score 4-5) without the need for therapeutic anticoagulation should continue prophylactic treatment with a non-heparin alternative. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) blocks the platelet Fc γ receptors at high doses (2 g/kg over 2 days) and, consequently, inhibits antibody-mediated platelet activation [105] . It can be an option in patients at high risk for autoimmune HIT or lifethreatening thrombosis and bleeding (e.g., cavernous sinus thrombosis, pregnancy, severe limb ischemia) [106] . IVIG has been used successfully in the preoperative period. It was shown to reduce the activity of HIT antibodies and also decreased the risk of thrombosis while rapidly increasing the platelet count shortly after initiation of therapy [107] . Plasma exchange has been described as an adjunctive therapy for life-threatening HIT, particularly in the setting of urgent cardiac surgery requiring full heparinization. Its mechanism has not been fully determined, but it is thought to remove pathogenic immune complexes and potentially correct coagulopathy with FFP replacement [108] . In cardiac surgery, the removal of prothrombotic complexes facilitates heparin use at high doses [16] . A single plasmapheresis session reduces EIA reactivity with a loss of SRA reactivity [109] . The anti-PF4/ heparin antibody titer decreases by approximately 50-80%. In a case series describing 11 cardiac surgery patients with HIT managed with intraoperative plasmapheresis before heparin administration for cardiopulmonary bypass, none of the patients with reduced titers developed clinical HIT [108] . To date, only a few institutions are using plasma exchange for HIT antibody elimination [110] . Intravenous epoprostenol (IV prostacyclin) is a prostaglandin that is FDA-approved as a pulmonary vasodilator for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Intravenous prostacyclins inhibit platelet aggregation by activating intracellular adenylate cyclase to increase cAMP in the platelets. In a small case series, intravenous epoprostenol was administered in an ""off-label"" manner, in conjunction with heparin, to facilitate anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass [111] . The authors deemed the use of IV epoprostenol to be safe and effective, especially for patients with impaired renal function where bivalirudin-induced anticoagulation may have lingered and been associated with harm after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. To date, there is a paucity of robust pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies to further evaluate the use of IV prostacyclins for this indication. In patients with a history of HIT with positive antibodies requiring non-emergent surgical procedures with heparinization (e.g., cardiac and vascular procedures, PCI, etc.), the current recommendation is to delay surgery until the functional assay is negative [112] and then to use heparin [50, 87] . If surgery is urgent or emergent, bivalirudin is the recommended drug of choice [87] , although plasmapheresis or therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) followed by heparin anticoagulation has been safely used at our institution for more than a decade in cardiac surgical operations that require systemic anticoagulation for cardiopulmonary bypass (Fig. 1) [108] . This off-label use of TPE has been supported as a potential option for antibody removal in non-surgical patients [109] . Intraoperative TPE is a valuable adjunct in the management of antibody-mediated syndromes including HIT and is FDA-approved for the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. TPE permits heparin use by removing immune complexes and HIT antibodies [113] . Intraoperative TPE can also allow for the routine reversal of post-cardiopulmonary bypass heparin reversal using protamine. In a retrospective study of 11 HIT or heparin/PF4 seropositive patients undergoing TPE in preparation for cardiac surgery, a single TPE treatment reduced heparin/PF4 titers by 50-84%, and 7 of 9 patients had normal anti-heparin/PF4 levels after treatment [108] . Following re-exposure to heparin, no serious adverse complications of HIT or to TPE were noted. Conflict of Interest Ingrid Moreno-Duarte declares that she has no conflict of interest. @story_separate@HIT is a devastating clinical condition that will lead to loss of life and/or limb if it is not quickly recognized, diagnosed, and managed in patients that have undergone surgery. The incidence of HIT development is higher in surgical patients than it is in non-surgical patients owing to the inflammatory milieu generated during surgery as well as the potential for heparin exposure, especially in select patients such as those that have undergone orthopedic or cardiac surgery. While the recognition and understanding of the pathogenesis of HIT has dramatically improved over the past several decades due to important basic and translational studies evaluating disease biology, there remains a paucity of information regarding optimal treatment modalities. Current therapy pivots on heparin avoidance and alternative nonheparinoid anticoagulation. Although therapeutic plasma exchange has been used as a means of quickly removing antibodies, comparative effectiveness studies have not been performed to assign a high level of evidence to the use of TPE in the setting of HIT management.

RECENT FINDINGS: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) occurs more frequently in surgical patients compared with medical patients due to the inflammatory release of platelet factor 4 and perioperative heparin exposure. Recognition of this disease requires a high index of suspicion. Diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies have been expanded and refined in recent years. SUMMARY: HIT is a condition where antibodies against the heparin/platelet factor 4 complex interact with platelet receptors to promote platelet activation, aggregation, and thrombus formation. Our review will focus on intraoperative and postoperative considerations related to HIT to help the clinician better manage this rare but often devastating hypercoagulable disease process."
"COVID-19 has turned into a global problem since recent months with spreading to more than 150 countries around the globe and transforming to a pandemic (1) . In a study by Ruanet al, they showed that the mortality rate ofCOVID-19 significantly increased in the presence of cardiovascular abnormalities (2) . Another study noted that underlying diseases such as hypertension can increase the mortality rate up to 2.5 times (3) . Although the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in patients with cardiac failure are unknown, the clinical features of patients with end-stage heart disease indicate cardiac injury by the virus (4) (5) (6) . COVID-19 manifestations also linked with demographic parameters. The highest mortality is related to older men with a mean age of 75 years, who also present histories of underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart problems, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, and prior surgery. COVID-19 exaggerates cardiovascular complications by promoting arterial and venous thrombosis through inducing inflammation, activating platelets, and causing vascular dysfunction and blockade. Because of this, antithrombotic drugs are recommended to be prescribed in these patients (7) . In addition to promoting inflammatory responses and myocardial injury, COVID-19 also augments the risk of acute coronary artery syndrome, HF, and arrhythmias (8) . Cardiac arrhythmias are the most threatening complications of heart diseases and cause the death of a large number of patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19 in the Shahid Mostafa Khomeini Hospital of Ilam from March to August 2020.@story_separate@In this descriptive-analytical study, all patients with COVID-19 and a cardiac condition admitted to the intensive care unit during March to August 2020were enrolled by census. A definite diagnosis of COVID-19 by PCR was applied as an inclusion criterion. Electrocardiography (ECG) and Holter monitoring were used to diagnose cardiac status. Data analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel applying descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage). In total, 45 eligible patients were enrolled, of whom 26 (57.8%) were men, and 19 (42.2%)were women. Twelve people (26.7%) had an age under 60 years old, 23 (51.1%) were between 60 and 70 years old, and 10 (22.3%) were over 70 years old. Of these patients, 40 (88.9%) had a history of hospitalization prior to admission. The criterionfor being hospitalized was a positive PCR test. After the diagnosis of Covid-19 based on clinical symptoms, treatment and supportive care were started, and after confirmation by PCR (which generally takes around 48 to 72 hours), the patient was subjected to major therapeutic measures. The medications used for these patients included Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Dexamethasone, Recigen, and Remdesivir, according to clinical signs and symptoms. The genotype of SARS-CoV-2 in this period was D614G. Table 1 demonstrates the frequencies of different types of arrhythmias and non-arrhythmias observed in ECG. Figure 1 shows the frequencies of AF and PVC arrhythmias in each gender. The fatality rate of arrhythmias among COVID-19 patients was 17.77% (8 out of 45 patients of whom6 (13.33%) were males, and 2 (4.44%) were females).The recovery rate was obtained 82.13% (37 out of 45), of whom 20 (46.44%) were men, and 17 (37.77%) were women. From deceased patients, each of AF, VT, and VF was detected in two patients. Holter monitoring was performed to verify arrhythmia in 3 patients, of whom; one was diagnosed with VT, and the other two with sinus tachycardia. Table 2 shows the frequency of death in COVID-19 patients with arrhythmia and non-arrhythmia disorders. Figure 1 shows the prevalence of AF and PVC arrhythmias in each gender. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f between the SARS-CoV infection and inflammatory mediators that may play important roles in the path physiology of cardiac events and arrhythmias. In one study, the rate of heart damage was 1% in around 19% of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this event was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality (9) . The mortality rate of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients was 17.77%, and the recovery rate was 82.13%. Although acute lung injury is a common problem in patients with COVID-19, which leads to significant morbidity and mortality, clinical and epidemiological evidences suggest that COVID-19 infection is also associated with myocardial damage and arrhythmias (2) . According to Mandipet al. studying cardiovascular risk factors in patients with heart conditions, 30.5%, 26.3%, 14.3%, 16.8%, and 5.5% of the patients reported hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, a history of smoking, and current smoking, respectively. In the recent study, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cardiovascular diseases included coronary artery disease (11.3%), congestive heart failure (2.1%), and cardiac arrhythmia (3.4%). The patients' average length of hospital stay was between 8 and 12 days, and the overall in-hospital mortality rates were 5.8% in total (515 out of 8910 patients) and 24.7% in the patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (2) . The most common arrhythmias in the deceased patients were AF, VF, and VT, respectively. This was in line with the study of Pitroet al. who asserted that the virus-induced aberrant function of the immune system increased the risk of arrhythmic events, including severe ventricular arrhythmias (11). We noticed that the mortality rate was higher among men than women. Along with age and gender, many other complications and parameters have been associated with severity and mortality rate in COVID-19 and SARS infections. Nevertheless, age was comparable between men and women in our study. However, the disease was more severe in men than women. Despite a similar distribution in men and women, the number of men who died of COVID-19 was 2.4 times higher than women. Regardless of age, men with COVID-19 infection have been at a higher risk for severe consequences and death (12). Tachycardia and failure to respond to heart rate reducing drug may be features of COVID-19 patients. These can overlap with the symptoms of heart diseases, and therefore, there is a need for further investigation of a possible COVID-19 infection in patients with arrhythmic symptoms. The low power of the study was one of our limitations, which was due to the relatively small number of COVID-19 patients in the province. It is recommended to screen cardiac abnormalities inCOVID-19 patients, which can affect their prognosis and survival by early diagnosis of arrhythmias.@story_separate@Although arrhythmias are not common in COVID-19 patients, they have a high mortality rate, necessitating early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.","Introduction Cardiac arrhythmias are important causes of death among populations and always responsible for a high percentage of mortality in hospitalized patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients in the Shahid Mostafa Khomeini Hospital of Ilam from March to August 2020. Materials and Methods In this descriptive-analytical study, all the COVID-19 patients with a cardiac condition admitted to the intensive care unit were enrolled by census. Electrocardiography (ECG) and Holter monitoring were used to diagnose arrhythmias. Data analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel using descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage). Results The total number of eligible patients was 45, of whom 26 (57.8%) were men, and 19 (42.2%) were women. The mortality rate of arrhythmias among COVID-19 patients was 17.77% (8 out of 45 patients), and the recovery rate was 82.13% (37 out of 45 patients). Conclusion Tachycardia and the lack of response to heart rate reducing drug be observed in patients with COVID-19.Owing to an overlap between these symptoms and those of heart diseases, there is a need to further evaluate patients with arrhythmias. Although arrhythmias are not common in COVID-19 patients, they can be fatal and inflict a high mortality rate, which can be prevented by early detection."
"The break of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread over the world, which has been declared as a global pandemic [1] . Accurate lung infections segmentation is one of the most important pre-processing steps for assessment and quantification of COVID-19 [2] [3] [4] [5] . The classic UNet [6] and UNet++ [7] were widely performed as segmentation architectures for COVID-19. Recently, UNet-Inf [8] with a parallel partial decoder was proposed to segment lung infections. Despite achieving good results, these approaches are still incapable of exploring sufficient information from multifocal infections, appearing in different lobe zones [9, 10] . It may hinder the infections segmentation performance, especially considering each pixel in isolation, as local information is noisy and ambiguous. It is also noteworthy that infections with various size occur in different scales. To tackle these two challenges, it is imperative to perform multi-scale long-term interactions on COVID-19 CT images, which contributes to model long-term dependencies among multiple lesions. Recently, graph convolution [11] has been incorporated into computer vision tasks for globally reasoning, which can be generally summarized as two kinds of approaches: feature space graph convolution and coordinate space graph convolution. The feature space graph convolution captures interdependencies along the channel dimensions of the feature map, which projects the feature into a non-coordinate space [12] [13] [14] [15] ; whistle coordinate space graph convolution explicitly models the spatial relationships between pixels [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , which projects the feature into a new coordinate space, to produce coherent prediction between the disjoint infections. In this paper, we propose a saliency-aware projectionbased Graph-based Pyramid Global Context Reasoning (Graph-PGCR) module for COVID-19 lung infections segmentation. Different from the existing work that the infection-related pixels were highlighted via average pooling [16] or maximum object probability [17] , we propose a saliencyaware projection (SAP) to keep eye on 'where' is an informative part, and thus selects discriminative pixels to form a fully-connected graph. In addition, we further take the multiscale cues into consideration to address the challenge that different infections appear in various scales. Inspired by the Pyramid Pooling Module [21] , we build a pyramid global context reasoning architecture to harvest multi-scale representations via SAP with various sampling rates. Hence, a coarser graph is constructed with lower sampling rate, providing more global dependencies for the larger receptive scale; while a finer graph is modeled with higher sampling rate, embedding more explicit long-range context for the smaller receptive field. In this way, we can perform graph reasoning on each scale and aggregate local and global clues to make the final prediction more reliable. Our Graph-PGCR module is plug-and-play and thus can be integrated into a wide variety of existing network architectures to further enhance their performance. In summary, the main contributions of this research are four-fold: (i) We propose a Graph-PGCR module to model long-range dependencies among disjoint infections as well as adapt size variation; (ii) We propose a SAP mechanism to select the infection-related pixels as a set of graph nodes, where global contextual information can be propagated via graph convolution; (iii) We construct multiple graphs to harvest multi-scale contextual patterns from infections with various size; (iv) We conduct extensive experiments on public and private COVID-19 dataset, where our method yields consistent improvements over a number of baselines. Fig.1 illustrates an overview of the proposed Graph-PGCR module in the segmentation architecture (e.g. UNet). Given an input image, we first extract features via the UNet-Encoder, and then our Graph-PGCR module is integrated to capture multi-scale long-range representations. Benefitting from the saliency-aware projection, the input feature map is firstly sampled into (e.g. = 3) parallel pyramid levels with various scales. After individual graph convolution, the reprojection via upsampling and the multi-scale fusion with concatenation layers are performed to generate the feature representation , which is finally fed into the UNet-decoder for prediction. It is worth noting that the input feature map can be extracted from any layer of deep convolutional model. In the following subsections, we introduce the detail of each component in the Graph-PGCR module.@story_separate@In order to project infection-related pixels in coordinate space into a set of graph nodes in a new coordinate space, we proposed a saliency-aware projection mechanism, which integrates attention mechanism with pooling operation. Specifically, the attention mechanism aims at learning where to emphasize or suppress; while the pooling operation desires of picking out discriminative pixels. Before projection, we need to reduce the dimension of feature map , which enhances the capacity of the projection. Inspired by the dual attention network [22] , we implement the channel attention module to capture the channel dependencies between any two channel maps via self-attention mechanism. After enhancing the feature representation, we adopt a 1×1 convolution layer to reduce the feature dimension from to . Similarly, the feature map also enhanced by spatial attention module to model the spatial dependencies between any two positions. Benefiting from the channel and spatial attention modules, we could emphasize interdependent feature maps and improve the feature representation of specific semantics. Considering that pooling along the channel dimension can effectively highlight informative regions [23] , we further perform the max-pooling and average-pooling operations on the channel axis and then concatenate them to generate an attention map ∈ ℝ ,×which focus on the salient pixels related to infections and surpass unnecessary ones. As vividly shown in Fig.2 , the attention map with spatial size of × is divided into several non-overlapping sub-regions with the stride of pixels. Within each region, the pixel with maximum localization probability: = arg max 8 9 ( ; ) is selected as a node. This process results in a set of nodes = { @ } @BC for the feature map . equals to / × / and represents the number of nodes. • is the ceiling operation, which gives the smallest integer equal or larger than its input. Note that the process can be considered as a sampling process and 1/ can be considered as a sampling rate. In view of this, each node @ is represented by its corresponding image coordinates. It is worth noting that the spatial interval between nodes can be controlled by adjusting . The coarser graph is constructed with lager values, which perhaps captures longer-range interactions among nodes. In contrast, all pixels are assigned as individual nodes in the extreme case, where = 1. The initial feature representation of each @ is extracted from the feature map enhanced in both channel and spatial dimensions. This results in a set of node features, ∈ ℝ G× , where equals to the feature dimension of . In spite of graph reasoning exploring the global context, the long-term context pattern differs in multiple scales of the same image. Specifically speaking, the finer representation with smaller receptive field (smaller ) embeds more explicit context; while the coarser representation with larger receptive scale (larger ) explores global dependencies. Taking the multi-scale schema into consideration, we incorporate it with graph reasoning to extend the long-range contextual patterns, and thus devise the Graph-PGCR module. Fig. 2 . An illustration of the proposed saliency-aware projection (SAP) mechanism. In this example, the attention map ∈ ℝ H×H is sampled with the stride = 2. We then find the pixel with maximum localization probability in each region (shown in different colors), which is selected as the node. As seen in Fig.1 , the graph convolution begins with subsampling the convolved features into parallel pyramid levels with various scales via saliency-aware projection. Higher sampling rate (smaller ) generates finer representations; while the coarser features are extracted from lower sampling rate (larger ). After selecting infection-related pixels as a set of nodes, a lightweight fully-connected graph with adjacency matrix K ∈ ℝ L × L is generated from -th separate branch for propagating information across nodes, as depicted in Fig.3 . The adjacency matrix K is defined as the similarity between nodes, where the more similar feature representations of two nodes, the stronger connectivity between them. It can be formulated as: where K (•) and K (•) are two learnable 1-dimensional linear transformations along node-wise dimension, ⨂ is the matrix multiplication. We further apply a softmax layer to yield a normalized adjacency matrix K . Then we conduct the graph convolution [11] in our model as: (2) where K • is a learnable linear transformation, K ∈ ℝ G×G is a trainable weight matrix, • is the ReLU activation function, and K is the output feature map after graph convolution in -th separate branch. To provide complementary feature for the down-stream task, the last step is to map the relation-aware features (ℝ G× L ) generated from -th separate branch back to the coordinate space (ℝ U×,×-), which is compatible with the regular CNN. To achieve the dimension transformation, we reshape the relation-aware K ∈ ℝ G× L into K ∈ ℝ G× ,/V L × -/V L . Then, a simple but effective upsampling operation is adopted as the reprojection function. In practice, the bilinear interpolation is performed to resize / K × / K to the original spatial input size × . To maintain the original information, we further utilize a multi-scale fusion to fuse the reshaped relation-aware features from each scale with the original feature map in a learnable way, which carries both local and global context information. The multi-scale fusion process can be formulated as: where (•) realizes the feature aggregation mechanism with a 1×1 convolution followed by a batch normalization and a ReLU activation function. (•) indicate up-sampling operation, and • represents the concatenation. As a result, we have the feature with channel dimension of . The method was evaluated on two datasets: the public and our private COVID-19 datasets. (i) The public COVID-19 dataset [24] : It contains 20 COVID-19 CT scans from the Coronacases Initiative and Radiopaedia, which were manually annotated for the left lung, right lung and COVID-19 infection. In the experiment, we trained our models using the 16 volumes with 2-fold cross-validation and average the experiment results as the final performance. (ii) The private COVID-19 dataset: we collected 102 COVID-19 CT scans (from the Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University), which has passed the ethic approvals. The left lung, right lung, and infection were annotated by two radiologists with 5-year experience in chest radiology. For our study, 82 scans were randomly selected for training and the other 20 scans for testing. After 2-fold cross-validation, we averaged the experiment results as the final performance. The input image consisted of three slices: the slice to be segmented and the upper and lower slices, which was cropped to 224×224×3. The networks were updated utilizing the stochastic gradient descent, where the learning rate was 1e-3 and weight decay was 5e-4. To effectively model the global contextual information, our Graph-PGCR module was appended at the end of the encoder as seen in Fig.1 . After feature extraction, the input feature map had the size of 1024×14× 14. We simply set node feature dimension = 64 in our implementation. The Dice coefficient was employed as our principal performance metric for each case. This section experiments the effect of key components of the Graph-PGCR module on the public COVID-19 dataset for lung infection segmentation. It includes the architecture of the original UNet as a baseline, Dual Attention (DA) Module [22] , the proposed Graph-PGCR with different projection mechanisms and multi-scales with different . Table 1 shows the segmentation performances when gradually adding components to the UNet. As seen, each component of the Graph-PGCR module contributes to the performance. Generally, a total improvement of 3.88% was gained by our proposed Graph-PGCR module compared to baseline UNet. A series of UNet based variations are adopted to further exam the effectiveness of the proposed Graph-PGCR module, including UNet++ [7] , UNet-Inf [8] and UNet 3+ [25] . Except for Dual Attention (DA) module, we further compare our method with the state-of-the-art graph context reasoning module (i.e., GloRe) [13] . The hyper-parameters of the graph, e.g., the number of the nodes and its feature dimensions, are set based on [13] . It is worth noting that they are appended at the same place as our proposed module. (i) Quantitative comparison: Table 2 shows the comparison results on public and private dataset, where we have the following observations. First, the proposed Graph-PGCR module ( = 2) improves the performance from the baselines under different segmentation networks. Moreover, our proposed Graph-PGCR module ( = 2 ) has superior performance over GloRe module. Additionally, the Graph-PGCR module ( = 2,4,7) with multiple GCR achieves the best performance in four architectures, obtaining average improvement of 3.0 and 2.5 point between four backbones performed on two datasets. (ii) Qualitative comparison: Fig.4 visualizes the segmentation results of different plugin based on UNet 3+ network in our private datasets, including DA module, Glore unit, our proposed Graph-PGCR module ( = 2,4,7). The results illustrated how efficient our proposed Graph-PGCR module is on segmenting the irregular and even small infections. Specifically, it generates segmentation results that are close to the ground truth with much less missegmented infections. The success of Graph-PGCR module is owed to the ability of capturing multi-scale long-range dependencies.@story_separate@In this paper, we develop an effective GCN-based approach, termed as Graph-based Pyramid Global Context Reasoning (Graph-PGCR) module, to model the multi-scale long-range contextual relationships, which is critical for COVID-19 lung infections segmentation. Benefiting from the saliency-aware projection that selects infection-related pixels as graph nodes, a fully-connected graph is constructed where global contextual information is propagated across all nodes via graph convolution. The multi-scale schema is also adopted to explore distinct contextual patterns from multiple graphs. Experiments show that the proposed Graph-PGCR module can effectively capture global contextual dependencies in COVID-19 CT images and consistently improve over four strong baselines on lung infections segmentation task.","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread in 2020, emerging a mass of studies for lung infection segmentation from CT images. Though many methods have been proposed for this issue, it is a challenging task because of infections of various size appearing in different lobe zones. To tackle these issues, we propose a Graph-based Pyramid Global Context Reasoning (Graph-PGCR) module, which is capable of modeling long-range dependencies among disjoint infections as well as adapt size variation. We first incorporate graph convolution to exploit long-term contextual information from multiple lobe zones. Different from previous average pooling or maximum object probability, we propose a saliency-aware projection mechanism to pick up infection-related pixels as a set of graph nodes. After graph reasoning, the relation-aware features are reversed back to the original coordinate space for the down-stream tasks. We further construct multiple graphs with different sampling rates to handle the size variation problem. To this end, distinct multi-scale long-range contextual patterns can be captured. Our Graph-PGCR module is plug-and-play, which can be integrated into any architecture to improve its performance. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method consistently boost the performance of state-of-the-art backbone architectures on both of public and our private COVID-19 datasets."
"The coronavirus disease pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become the most far-reaching health threat of this century, with more than 39 million infected individuals and 1.1 million deaths worldwide 1 . The United States has been one of the most severely affected countries with 2.3 million infected cases and more than 200,000 deaths 2 . Michigan was one of the states in the country that was significantly impacted by the pandemic with more than 7000 deaths and 150,000 confirmed infections. Compared to adults, until recently children were rarely severely affected by this disease with more than 90% being either asymptomatic or with mild disease. 3 However, recent reports from Europe described a pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome resembling incomplete Kawasaki Disease (KD) in children. 4, 5 The CDC recently named this entity as MIS-C and formulated a case definition. 6 Since then, additional reports of MIS-C from Europe and the US have been published. 7, 8, 9 The objective of this report was to describe the initial clinical and laboratory features of MIS-C in a cohort of 34 children at presentation to a pediatric emergency J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f department (PED) of a single institution in Michigan. All of these children met the CDC MIS-C definition and presented to our PED approximately three weeks after the peak of adult COVID-19 cases in our state. Methods: This study was performed at a level one pediatric trauma center with more than 85,000 visits per year. Our hospital is located in Detroit, Michigan which experienced high mortality rates in adults from SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a retrospective chart review of thirty four children ≤ 21 years of age who presented to our PED, met the CDC definition of MIS-C (Supplemental Table 1 ) and required treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin between April 16, 2020 and July 07, 2020. Data on patient demographics, clinical features, laboratory parameters including COVID-19 testing (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal swabs-RT-PCR and/or IgG serology), management and outcomes were abstracted. Descriptive statistics was used to summarize patient and laboratory characteristics. We used percentages, and means with standard deviation to describe normally distributed variables and median and interquartile ranges for those that were not normally distributed. This study was approved by our institutional review board under expedited review with waiver of informed consent.@story_separate@The demographics and clinical features of this cohort of children at presentation to the PED are noted in Table 2 . The majority were African American, older than 5 years of age, and many had at least one prior health care visit in the preceding 48 hours. Comorbidities occurred in more than one third of the children with asthma being the most common. Fever ≥ 2 days, gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhea) anorexia and rash were the most common symptoms, while respiratory symptoms were rare. While generalized abdominal J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f tenderness was elicited in 44.4% of patients, specific right lower quadrant tenderness was present in two patients that resulted in a work up for appendicitis which was found to be negative. Shock (persistent hypotension requiring > 20ml/kg fluids or need for vasopressors) occurred more than one third of the patients overall, with 10 (29%) requiring vasopressor addition (dopamine or epinephrine) in the PED. Elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer were noted in the majority of children with MIS-C while elevation of transaminases and hypoalbuminemia were less common at presentation (Table 3 ). Patients had significant cardiac involvement at presentation with abnormalities noted in 33% of electrocardiograms (EKG) and more than 60% of echocardiograms (Supplemental Table 4 ). Further, of the patients with elevated troponin who also had an EKG (n=18) or ECHO (n=17) performed, 50% and 88.2% were abnormal respectively. Table 5 . Our case series of 34 children from a single institution is one of the largest reports in the US of MIS-C temporally associated with SARS-CoV2 that predominantly resulted in myocardial injury. Our report parallels that of those reported from both Europe and other parts of United 8 This could be reflective of the population race and ethnicity distribution in our PED which is predominantly non Hispanic, African American. Further, compared to other reports, children in our series were slightly younger the reasons for which are unclear. In contrast to adults, the clinical features of COVID-19 in children had previously been mild with most presenting with fever and respiratory symptoms. Critical illness was rare and usually secondary to respiratory illness without cardiac involvement. 3 In contrast, most of the children in our cohort with MIS-C required admission to the intensive care unit for circulatory and hemodynamic support given their significant myocardial injury involvement. Some children with MIS-C presented with similar clinical and laboratory features as incomplete KD. 10 However, notable differences that distinguished MIS-C from incomplete KD included older age, predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms and more shock and myocardial injury at presentation. 8, 9, 11, 12 The most striking occurrence in our cohort was the myocardial injury associated with MIS-C. While reports of troponin elevation in KD have conflicted, more than half of our patients with MIS-C had an elevated troponin associated with myocardial injury at presentation. 13, 14 Many children in our cohort had myocardial dysfunction with predominantly LV dysfunction and 3 children had coronary dilation at presentation, suggesting a rapid and severe inflammation with a predilection for the heart. Further, the majority of those who did not have myocardial dysfunction in the PED developed worsening myocardial function later in their course. In fact, the myocardial involvement in our children bears similarity to that seen in adult acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome which presents with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. 15 Although the exact reason for this myocardial involvement is unclear in children, in adults it has been hypothesized to be secondary to acute coronary syndrome, microvascular ischemic injury, myocarditis or cytokine dysregulation. A striking feature was that most children with MIS-C had lymphopenia which has been reported commonly in adults with severe COVID-19. 16 Postulated reasons for this lymphopenia in COVID-19 include direct cell lysis due to interaction with the expressed ACE 2 receptor on cell surface and apoptosis caused by circulating cytokines. 17 The hyponatremia observed in a large proportion of MIS-C at presentation was likely secondary to dehydration, renal or cardiac failure. While hyponatremia has been described as a predictor of poor outcome in both COVID- 19 and KD, its role as a prognosticator in MIS-C is unclear. 18, 19 Further, while elevated D dimer J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f levels have been associated with treatment resistant KD, its significance in cardiac involvement in MIS-C is unclear. 20 Lastly, a recent report describes a MIS-A (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults) which clinical features very similar to the MIS-C in children thus suggesting a possible common pathophysiology that warrants further investigation. 21 Certainly, as the pandemic continues, it is critical for emergency department providers to recognize the various clinical presentations of MIS-C and its serious cardiovascular complications. A more comprehensive evaluation may be warranted in any child presenting with a fever in combination with a rash, conjunctivitis or gastrointestinal symptoms regardless of COVID-19 exposure. Laboratory investigation should include an evaluation of markers for inflammation and myocardial injury including a troponin level, an EKG and an echocardiogram. Clinicians should also anticipate sudden clinical deterioration in these children and consider early critical care unit admission.@story_separate@Clinicians need to be on high alert for MIS-C in previously healthy children. Since many of these children present with myocardial injury and recover completely with timely treatment, institution of a standardized screening protocol in the emergency department may facilitate the early identification and evaluation of these children. Evidence of increased inflammation and myocardial injury should prompt immediate admission to the pediatric critical care unit to optimize management and prevent morbidity and mortality. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","The SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus of the coronavirus family responsible for a global pandemic since December 2019. More than 35 million people have been affected with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with more than one million deaths worldwide. Michigan was one of the top three states in the United States that was severely affected by the SAR-CoV-2 pandemic with more than 7000 deaths in adults and greater than 145,000 confirmed infections. However, compared to adults, the majority of children until recently were either asymptomatic or had a mild illness with SARS-CoV-2. Recently, a rare but potentially serious presentation associated with SARS-CoV-2 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been recently reported and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released a case definition for the same. We report the clinical and laboratory presentations and outcomes of 34 children with MIS-C who were evaluated within a 12 week period at a pediatric emergency department (PED) of single institution in Michigan. These cases presented approximately three weeks after the peak of adult SAR-CoV-2 related deaths occurred in the state. While many children presented with clinical characteristics similar to incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD), they also exhibited certain unique features which differentiated MIS-C from KD. The information presented below will aid clinicians with early recognition, evaluation and management of MIS-C in the emergency department."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 is the most devastating pandemic of the 21st century. The first case was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [1] . Since then, the virus has spread globally with an exponential increase in the number of cases. The causative organism, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family, and is transmitted mainly by respiratory droplets [1, 2] . As of December 28th 2020, over 80 million cases have been diagnosed worldwide with more than 13 million cases in the USA [3] . Infection with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from an asymptomatic carrier state to critical illness characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with multi-organ failure and death in the most severe cases [4] . Approximately 19% of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus progress to severe or critical COVID-19 disease [4] . Critical illness is characterized by high oxygen requirements that ranges from oxygen supplementation via face mask to intubation and mechanical ventilation. Risk factors associated with development of critical disease include older age, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity [5] . Oxygen levels upon admission and inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) have been proposed as predictors of poor prognosis in these patients [6] . Mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is extremely high and exceeds 50% [4, 7] . Studies from the USA have been limited by the inclusion of a large number of patients who remain hospitalized at the time of the analysis [5, 8] . We conducted a retrospective analysis to describe the characteristics, mortality, intubation rate, and length of stay (LOS) of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 disease and high oxygen requirement (critically ill) in a single center in Brooklyn, New York. @story_separate@We conducted a single center, retrospective, observational analysis at Maimonides Medical Center, a 711-bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Brooklyn, New York. The Maimonides Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved the study as minimal risk research and waived the need for informed consent. This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical standards of the responsible institution on human subjects as well as with the Helsinki Declaration. We identified patients 18 years of age and older who were admitted between March 19th and April 25th, 2020 with COV-ID-19 disease and high oxygen requirements. We considered patients to have a high oxygen requirement if they developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and required intubation with mechanical ventilation or needed high-level oxygen supplementation (face mask at more than 10 L per minute, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), or non-rebreather (NRB) oxygen face mask) at the time of admission or during hospitalization. The accepted method for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection was real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal sample. All patients included in this study presented to our emergency department with either symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection or had a history of exposure to a person with known COVID-19 infection. For patients who presented with symptoms and had a positive result after being tested as outpatient, they were re-tested in our emergency department to confirm COVID-19 infection. We excluded patients not requiring high concentrations of oxygen, patients who died within 1 day of being admitted, and those who died during their emergency room stay. Data were manually collected from the hospital's electronic medical record (Sunrise Clinical Manager). The information collected included patients' demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, initial vital signs on admission, pertinent laboratory tests, treatment received for COVID-19 disease, need for vasopressor support, anticoagulation, use of antibiotics for suspected bacterial superinfection, and outcomes, including length of hospital stay, complications, and mortality. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Mortality was described as death in hospital following the diagnosis of COV-ID-19 disease. The secondary outcome was length of hospital stay. Based on the clinical demographics, pertinent laboratory re-sults upon admission and the highest values recorded during hospitalization (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, LDH, troponin, and procalcitonin), and complications including hemodialysis, need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), bacteremia, and/or fungemia, we developed prediction models for intubation, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Descriptive statistics of mean and standard deviation were used to express continuous variables. Frequencies and percentages were used to describe categorical variables. Skewed variables were logarithmic-transformed. Troponin had values of 0, so 0.01 was added to all values and then the values underwent logarithmic transformation. For intubation, analysis of variance was used to compare the continuous variables and the Pearson's Chisquare test compared the categorical variables except for when expected cell size was < 5 in which case Fisher's exact test was performed. Any variable that was statistically significant in the univariate analysis was included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Univariate logistic regression was conducted for the outcome variable of mortality. Any variable statistically significant in the univariate analysis for mortality was included in the multivariate analysis. Univariate linear regression was conducted for the outcome variable of LOS. Any variable statistically significant in the univariate analysis for LOS was included in the multivariate analysis. All P values were two tailed. Alpha level for significance was at P < 0.05. IBM SPSS Statistics Version 26 was used for all analyses (IBM, 2019). A total of 398 critically ill patients with COVID-19 disease were included in this study. Two-hundred forty-seven (62.1%) patients required intubation, and 151 (37.9%) needed oxygen supplementation via HFNC or NRB oxygen mask. The mean age was 65.8 years ± 16.26, and 52.8% of patients were 65 years or older. Two thirds of the patients (66.6%) were males, while 19.1% Hispanic. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, (n = 237; 59.5%) followed by obesity (n = 167; 42.0%), and diabetes mellitus (n = 141; 35.4%). Other comorbidities included coronary artery disease (CAD) at 14.1%, heart failure at 11.3%, atrial fibrillation at 9.8%, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at 6.8%. The most common presenting symptoms included shortness of breath (83.2%), fever (73.4%), and cough (70.9%). Patients' demographics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, and laboratory values are given in Table 1 . Additional baseline characteristics are shown here (Supplementary Material 1, www.jocmr.org). Most patients received hydroxychloroquine (93.7%) and Laboratory values are on admission unless otherwise specified. One patient was still hospitalized. Those with sample size for continuous variables less than 398 are: white blood cell (n = 397), lymphocyte (n = 397), platelet (n = 397), creatinine (n = 396), C-reactive protein (n = 390), ferritin (n = 373), D-dimer (n = 217), lactate dehydrogenase (n = 373), glomerular filtration rate (n = 391), troponin (n = 387), and procalcitonin (n = 350). Sample size for continuous variables less than 398 are: oxygen saturation (n = 396), respiratory rate (n = 391); sample size for categorical variables missing are: obesity (n = 12), atrial fibrillation (n = 1), heart failure (n = 1), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 1), chronic kidney disease (n = 1), nausea (n = 1), and chest pain (n = 1). M: mean; SD: standard deviation. Table 2 summarizes the treatments received during admission. More than half of the patients (57.8%) needed vasopressor support. Hemodialysis was used in one-fifth of patients while blood transfusion was administered to 20.9%. Bacteremia and/ or fungemia were documented in one-fifth of the cases. The majority of patients (91.5%) received antibiotics ( Table 2 ). Figure 1 shows the percentage of some of the complications observed in the study population. Tables 1 and 2 show univariate comparisons for those patients who were either intubated or nonintubated. In the multivariate analysis, only obesity and use of vasopressor were each independently associated with increased odds for intubation ( Table 3) . Overall mortality in our study was 57.3% (n = 228). In an analysis comparing intubation and mortality, the mortality rate was significantly higher in intubated patients (78.1%) as compared to those not intubated (23.2%). Table 4 shows logistic regression analyses for mortality. In the multivariate analysis, increased age, intubation, and increased LDH were each independently associated with increased odds of mortality. Diarrhea was independently associated with decreased mortality. None of the comorbidities (including diabetes and hypertension), vital signs, treatment management, or complications was significantly associated with mortality. Table 2 . Table 5 shows the linear regression analyses for LOS. In the multivariate analysis, Asian race, hemodialysis, ECMO support, blood transfusion, treatment with steroids, remdesivir, or vitamin C, and diagnosis of bacteremia and/or fungemia were each independently associated with increased LOS. CAD was significantly associated with decreased LOS. In a multivariate analysis in the subset of patients who survived to dis-charge for variables significant in the whole sample multivariate analysis, hemodialysis, blood transfusion, use of vitamin C, and diagnosis of bacteremia/fungemia were each significantly associated with increased LOS. In the subset of patients with mortality for those variables significant in the whole sample multivariate analysis, blood transfusion, treatment with steroids, remdesivir, or vitamin C were each significantly associated with increased LOS. CAD was significantly associated with decreased LOS. Our study represents one of the largest analyses of patients with COVID-19 disease with high oxygen requirements and complete outcomes. We included 398 critically ill patients, of which 247 (62.1%) were intubated. The reported percentage of intubation in COVID-19 patients with critical disease ranges from 57% to 88% [7, [9] [10] [11] [12] . We found obesity and use of vasopressors were each independently associated with higher odds of intubation. These findings are consistent with a study that reported higher rates of intubation in obese COVID-19 patients [10] . The mean LOS in our study population was 19.1 days. Other studies on critically patients with COVID-19 have reported a LOS of 15 -22 days [5, 10] . We found that patients who died had a 2.5-time shorter LOS as compared to those who lived. This finding is consistent with other studies that have reported LOS for patients who died between 4 and 21 days and 4 to 53 days for those who were discharged alive [13] . The overall mortality in our cohort was 57.3%. This finding was mainly driven by a significantly higher mortality in intubated patients than non-intubated patients (78.1% versus 23.2%). In a previous study addressing patients with COV-ID-19, we reported a mortality of 50%; however, that study included patients with less severe disease [14] . Our current findings are consistent with reports from China concerning critically ill patients with COVID-19 disease. A study that examined 239 critically ill patients, of which 69% were intubated, showed a 61.5% mortality [7] . Similarly, another group reported a mortality rate of 56% in which more than half of the studied patients were intubated [9] . In a study from Italy that included 1,300 patients with COVID-19 treated in the intensive care unit (ICU), mortality was 26% despite 88% of the patients being intubated. However, more than 50% of patients remained hospitalized at the time of the analysis [15] . Studies from the New York City area have included cohorts of similar illness severity as our sample. The mortality rate reported in these studies ranged from 39% to 68%. However, they included a high percentage of patients (ranging from 23% to 37%) who remained hospitalized at the time of the analysis, which makes their results on mortality and LOS inconclusive [8, 11, 16] . In our study, only one patient remained hospitalized under hospice care. Various authors examined predictors of mortality and many reported older age to be independently associated with increased mortality [7, 11] . Other factors associated with higher mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 include chronic cardiac *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001. Analysis included one patient still hospitalized. Analysis includes 238 patients due to missing data. D-dimer, procalcitonin, and aspartate transaminase were not included in the multivariate analysis due to a lot of missing data.

OR: odds ratio; CI: confidence interval. disease (CAD and heart failure combined), high concentration of interleukin-6, elevated D-dimer, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, and ARDS [7, 11, 17] . We found increased age, LDH levels and intubation were each independently associated with increased mortality. In a pooled analysis including 1,532 patients, LDH levels were found to be associated with a 16-fold increase in mortality [18] . That analysis was based on the LDH value upon admission, whereas in our study we used the highest LDH value during hospitalization. Even though diabetes mellitus and hypertension are recognized risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 disease, they have failed to consistently show any association with higher mortality in critically ill patients [17, 19, 20] . One study found no difference in the rate of hypertension or diabetes between survivors and non-survivors of critical COVID-19 disease [7] . In contrast, another study reported a significant difference in mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 disease with diabetes versus non-diabetic patients (81% versus 47%). However, this difference in outcome could also be explained by the 10-year difference in age between the groups in that study [9] . Nonetheless, despite having a lower rate of hypertension and diabetes as compared to our cohort, both studies reported similar number of intubated patients and mortality rate similar to our findings [7, 9] . A study from Detroit, Michigan in the USA reported a mortality rate of 39% in 141 patients with COVID-19 who were treated in the ICU, including 114 (80%) intubated patients. Their cohort included 51.8% with diabetes and 78.7% with hypertension and yet the reported mortality was significantly lower than other reports with COVID-19 patients of similar severity [10] . These studies, including ours, suggest that diabetes and hypertension might not affect mortality in patients with COVID-19 disease once they progress to critical illness. Similarly, we did not find any association between gender and mortality. This finding is consistent with previously published data [7] . Previous studies examined gastrointestinal involvement in COVID-19 and reported diarrhea to be associated with prolonged symptoms, viral carriage, development of cytokine storm, and multi-organ damage [21, 22] . Other researchers have failed to establish an association between gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, with increased mortality, LOS, or mechanical ventilation [23] . Our analysis showed diarrhea to be independently associated with decreased mortality. Our study has some limitations. First, our analysis is subject to data entry errors given that the information was manually collected. To minimize this, we performed multiple checks during the process of data collection. Prior to data analysis, we double checked very abnormal laboratory values. Second, we did not include mechanical ventilation settings, which could be important information for management of these patients. However, our objective was to focus on mortality and LOS outcome. Third, smoking information was self-reported and was not provided in over 50% of patients. This information could be an important risk factor in patients with COVID-19 disease. Suppl 1. Complete list of baseline characteristics.@story_separate@Our study shows a high mortality rate in COVID-19 patients with high oxygen requirements. This finding is driven mainly by higher mortality in intubated patients. We found a significant difference in LOS between patients who died during hospitalization as compared to those who survived to discharge. Older age, intubation, and higher LDH levels were associated with increased mortality, while diarrhea was associated with decreased mortality. Gender, diabetes, and hypertension did not have any association with mortality or length of hospital stay.","BACKGROUND: Approximately 19% of people infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) progress to severe or critical stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a mortality rate exceeding 50%. We aimed to examine the characteristics, mortality rates, intubation rate, and length of stay (LOS) of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 disease with high oxygen requirements (critically ill). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis in a single center in Brooklyn, New York. Adult hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease and high oxygen requirements were included. We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses for statistically significant variables to reduce any confounding. RESULTS: A total of 398 patients were identified between March 19th and April 25th, 2020 who met the inclusion criteria, of which 247 (62.1%) required intubation. The overall mortality rate in our study was 57.3% (n = 228). The mean hospital LOS was 19.1 ± 17.4 days. Patients who survived to hospital discharge had a longer mean LOS compared to those who died during hospitalization (25.4 ± 22.03 days versus10.7 ± 1.74 days). In the multivariate analysis, increased age, intubation and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were each independently associated with increased odds of mortality. Diarrhea was associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.4; CI 0.16, 0.99). Obesity and use of vasopressors were each independently associated with increased intubation. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19 disease and high oxygen requirements, advanced age, intubation, and higher LDH levels were associated with increased mortality, while diarrhea was associated with decreased mortality. Gender, diabetes, and hypertension did not have any association with mortality or length of hospital stay."
"COronaVIrus Disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was deemed a public health emergency of international concern in January 2020 [1] [2] [3] . As of October 27, 2020, over 42 million cases and well over 1.1 million fatalities of SARS-CoV-2 have occurred globally since its emergence in December 2019 [1, 4] . Transmitted primarily by inhalation of secretions generated by infected individuals and direct contact with fomites [5, 6] , SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a wide range of clinical manifestations. Mild symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection include cough, fever, sore throat, malaise and muscle weakness, which typically occur 4-5 days after infection [7] . Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea can occur in 3-4% of those infected [8] . An estimated 15% develop severe pneumonia and approximately 5% progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), kidney injury, cardiac injury, liver dysfunction, and sometimes death [9, 10] . The reported case fatality rates of SARS-CoV-2 range from 1-7% [11] . Despite ongoing clinical testing of vaccines and therapeutics [12] , there remains no medical countermeasure approved for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [13] . A crucial hurdle in the race to implement an effective vaccine is the need for a high-throughput means to quantify humoral protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Such assays are also crucial for assessing the immune response of recovered COVID-19 patients and conducting large-scale epidemiological studies. Several in-house and commercially-available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been developed to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies raised upon infection [14, 15] . While these platforms provide a high-throughput means of detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, they are unable to measure the immunological function of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. In contrast, the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) quantifies levels of antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, due to the time-consuming and laborious nature of the PRNT, as well as the need for containment level 3 (CL-3) facilities to work with the Risk Group-3 pathogen, it is limited in its capacity to be implemented in large-scale immunity testing. Virus neutralizing antibodies confer protection by blocking the interaction that mediates virus entry into susceptible host cells. For SARS-CoV-2, this interaction involves binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [16] . The Genscript SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (sVNT) is a commercially-available assay that detects antibodies that specifically inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction without the use of live SARS-CoV-2 [17] . While the assay is high-throughput and can be safely conducted in containment level 2 (CL-2) facilities, it remains unknown whether the assay accurately captures functional antibody-mediated neutralization to the same extent as the reference standard PRNT. Ideally, a surrogate neutralization test should demonstrate high sensitivity and a low false negative rate for samples eliciting neutralization by PRNT. Conversely, a surrogate neutralization test should demonstrate a low non-neutralizing antibody detection rate, which we define as the rate at which specimens that test positive by the assay are unable to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by PRNT. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the commercially-available sVNT for SARS-CoV-2 compared with an in-house PRNT as a reference standard. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the sVNT with the PRNT using a panel of serological samples from COVID-19 patients, healthy individuals, as well as non-COVID-19 patients. While the sVNT demonstrated similar or greater detection of COVID-19 specimens, it displayed a high non-neutralizing antibody detection rate for PRNT-negative COVID-19 samples, which may lead to over-estimation of a functional neutralizing antibody response. Furthermore, the sVNT demonstrated cross-reactivity for specimens collected from SARS-CoV-1 and syphilis patients compared with PRNT. However, due to its low false negative rate for specimens eliciting 90% SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, the sVNT may offer a high-throughput screening tool to prioritize samples for neutralizing antibody testing. coronavirus OC43 by molecular testing (n=1), human coronavirus 229E by molecular testing (n=1), HIV by serological testing (n=10), and syphilis by serological testing (n=20) were used to evaluate the cross-reactivity of the assays.@story_separate@The SARS-CoV-2 PRNT was adapted from a previously described method for SARS-CoV-1 [18] . Briefly, serological specimens were diluted 2-fold from 1:20 to 1:640 in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and challenged with 50 plaque forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Canada/ON_ON-VIDO-01-2/2020, EPI_ISL_425177), which were titrated by plaque assay [19] . After 1 hour of incubation at 37°C and 5% CO 2 , the sera-virus mixtures were added to 12-well plates containing Vero E6 cells at 90-100% confluence and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 for 1 hour. After adsorption, a liquid overlay comprising 1.5% carboxymethylcellulose diluted in MEM supplemented with 4% FBS, L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, and sodium bicarbonate was added to each well and plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 for 72 hours. The liquid overlay was removed and cells were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 1 hour at room temperature. The monolayers were stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 10 minutes and washed with 20% ethanol. Plaques were enumerated and compared to controls. The highest serum dilution resulting in 50% and 90% reduction in plaques compared with controls were defined as the PRNT-50 and PRNT-90 endpoint titers, respectively. PRNT-50 titres and PRNT-90 titers ≥1:20 were considered positive for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. The SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (sVNT) Kit (L00847; GenScript, Piscataway, USA) was performed according to manufacturer instructions, with each sample tested in duplicate. Briefly, samples and controls were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated RBD (HRP-RBD) at 37 °C for 30 minutes. The mixtures were added to the hACE2-coated capture plate and incubated at 37 °C for 15 minutes. Plates were then washed, removing HRP-RBD:neutralizing antibody complexes and allowing unbound HRP-RBD and HRP-RBD:non-neutalizing antibody complexes to remain bound to hACE2. TMB solution was added and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes and the reaction was stopped by Stop Solution. The OD of each well was measured by spectrophotometry at 450 nm. The percent inhibition of a sample was calculated as (1-Average OD of sample/Average OD of negative control) x 100%. A sample with a percent inhibition <20% was considered -negative‖ and ≥20% was considered -positive‖ for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Test results generated from the kit evaluation were categorized as either -positive‖ or -negative‖ for SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies as described above. Detection was defined as the proportion of samples collected from COVID-19 patients which tested positive in each assay. Sensitivity of the sVNT compared with PRNT was defined as the proportion corresponded with negligible, low, moderate, high, and very high correlation [20] . P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Serological specimens collected from molecular-confirmed COVID-19 patients were tested to evaluate the detection by the sVNT compared with PRNT-50 and PRNT-90. The sVNT detected 78.9% of all serological specimens collected from molecular-confirmed COVID-19 patients (Table 1) , which was similar compared with PRNT-50 (80.9%, p=0.5708) and increased compared with PRNT-90 (50.5%, p<0.0001 Sensitivity: percentage of SARS-CoV-2 PRNT positive samples from COVID-19 patients that also tested positive by sVNT. False negative rate: percentage of SARS-CoV-2 PRNT positive samples from COVID-19 patients, which tested negative by sVNT. †Non-neutralizing antibody detection rate: percentage of SARS-CoV-2 PRNT negative samples from COVID-19 patients, which tested positive by sVNT. Specificity: percentage of SARS-CoV-2 PRNT negative samples from healthy individuals that also tested negative by sVNT. Pearson's Chi-square tests were conducted to analyze the difference in sensitivity of the sVNT for PRNT-50+ and PRNT-90+ COVID-19 specimens. Number of specimens of total subset and 95% confidence intervals are indicated in parentheses. *=p<0.05, **=p<0.001, ***=p<0.0001. Serological specimens collected from molecular-confirmed COVID-19 patients were tested to evaluate the correlation between the % inhibition values generated by the sVNT and titres generated by PRNT-50 and PRNT-90 ( Figure 1 ). The Pearson's product-moment correlation between sVNT % inhibition and log-transformed PRNT-50 titres was 0.73, corresponding with a high degree of positive correlation. The Pearson's product-moment correlation between sVNT % inhibition and log-transformed PRNT-90 titres was 0.65, corresponding with a moderate degree of positive correlation. The blue lines and the grey bands show the fitted linear models and the 95% confidence level intervals, respectively. The cross-reactivity of the sVNT for SARS-CoV-1 specimens was 70%, which was significantly higher than the PRNT-50 (10%; p=0.0015) and PRNT-90 (0%; p=0.0005) ( Table 3 ). All assays demonstrated 0% cross-reactivity with hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43 specimens. Compared with the sVNT and PRNT-90, which demonstrated 0% cross-reactivity for HIV specimens, the PRNT-50 demonstrated an increased cross-reactivity of 20%. However, this increase was not considered significant (p=0.4795). The cross-reactivity of the sVNT for syphilis specimens was 50%, which was significantly higher (p=0.0044) than PRNT-50 and PRNT-90, both of which demonstrated 0% cross-reactivity. The total cross-reactivity of the sVNT of 46.2% was significantly greater than the PRNT-50 (7.69%; p<0.0001) and PRNT-90 (0%; p<0.0001).  The COVID-19 pandemic has warranted an urgent need to understand both vaccine-mediated and infection-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we validated a commercially-available sVNT and established a high-throughput algorithm for COVID-19 neutralizing antibody testing as depicted in Figure 2 . The sVNT demonstrated similar detection of specimens collected from COVID-19 patients as the PRNT-50 and higher detection of specimens collected from COVID-19 patients than the PRNT-90. Furthermore, the sVNT generated % inhibition values that positively correlated with PRNT-50 and PRNT-90 titres and demonstrated excellent specificity when testing sera from healthy individuals collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we anticipated the sVNT would demonstrate some cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-1 sharing ~75% homology with SARS-CoV-2 Spike [21] , it did not demonstrate cross-reactivity with sera from hCoV-OC43 (β-coronavirus) and hCoV-229E (α-coronavirus) patients. However, since these samples were only confirmed by molecular testing, it is possible the sera was collected prior to the development of antibodies against hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-229E. It is also important to note only one sample was tested for each of these subsets and future investigation will be required to understand the generalizability of this observation. Interestingly, the sVNT demonstrated cross-reactivity with specimens from syphilis patients. Cross-reactivity with sera from syphilis patients has also been demonstrated in Borrelia burgdorferi [23] and West Nile virus [23] assays. However, due to the number of samples used in the cross-reactivity study, further testing of larger subsets will be needed to understand the relevance of the cross-reactivity of the sVNT. Since sVNTs are intended to be used as surrogate assays to measure functional humoral immunity, we investigated the ability of the Genscript sVNT kit to differentiate between non-neutralizing and neutralizing COVID-19 specimens. To do so, we evaluated the non-neutralizing antibody detection rate of the sVNT for COVID-19 specimens that were unable to functionally neutralize 50% and 90% of SARS-CoV-2 by PRNT. We found that the sVNT demonstrated a high non-neutralizing antibody detection rate, generating positive results for 32.4% and 58.3% of samples confirmed negative by PRNT-50 and PRNT-90, respectively. The inability of some sVNT positive specimens to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by PRNT could be attributed to the detection of poorly neutralizing anti-RBD antibodies, which have been documented in several studies [24, 25] . Due to this, caution should be exercised if the sVNT is used as an alternative to the PRNT because specimens that test positive by sVNT may not be able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and may translate to inability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. However, further studies may evaluate more stringent cut-off values to enhance specificity and reduce the non-neutralizing antibody detection rate of the sVNT. We wished to investigate whether the sVNT could instead be used as high-throughput method of screening samples for subsequent testing by the laborious and time-consuming PRNT. We evaluated the sensitivity of the sVNT for COVID-19 specimens that were confirmed capable of neutralizing 50% and 90% of SARS-CoV-2 by PRNT. We found that the sVNT demonstrated high sensitivity for both PRNT-50+ and PRNT-90+ specimens. However, the sVNT demonstrated a significantly higher false negative rate for PRNT-50+ specimens compared with PRNT-90. This could be attributed to the inability of the sVNT to detect neutralizing antibodies that target non-RBD epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 [24] , including the N-terminal domain of the spike protein [26] . It could also fail to detect antibodies targeting two different cleavage sites of the Spike protein that may neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by blocking priming by the serine protease, TMPRSS2, crucial for entry into the cell via ACE2 [27] . Future research assessing the limit of detection and analytical sensitivity will be important in understanding the false negative rate of the sVNT for samples that test positive by PRNT-50. Given the significantly higher sensitivity and lower false negative rate of the sVNT for PRNT-90+ specimens over PRNT-50+ specimens, we concluded that a negative result produced by the sVNT could accurately predict a negative result by PRNT-90 and be used to screen out samples for further testing. Meanwhile, specimens giving a positive result by the sVNT could be subsequently tested by PRNT-90 to confirm the presence of neutralizing antibodies (Figure 2 ). Such an algorithm could significantly optimize neutralizing antibody testing compared with solely testing by PRNT, which can take up to seven days from cell preparation to process 32 samples at a time by highly trained CL-3 staff. In contrast, the sVNT can process a large number of specimens in CL-2 within 2-3 hours, significantly reducing the number of samples requiring confirmation by PRNT. There remains limitations to consider for the implementation of the described algorithm for analyzing humoral protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. First, the algorithm uses 90% neutralization as a reference-standard, which may prevent the detection of specimens only capable of neutralizing 50% of SARS-CoV-2. While much remains unknown about the characteristics of the neutralizing antibody responses required for protection, conclusions about neutralizing antibodies vary in studies using 50% neutralization as a reference-standard. On one hand, high neutralizing titres capable of 50% neutralization correlated with protection in immunized non-human primates [28] and COVID-19 patients receiving convalescent plasma transfusions [29] . In contrast, other studies did not observe a correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and clinical course of disease when using 50% neutralization as a reference-standard [30] . Given that heterogeneity in B cell responses gives rise to antibodies of varying affinity and avidity within a single host [31] , it could be possible that an antibody response capable of 50% neutralization lacks the collective potency to effectively block entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 compared with an antibody response capable of eliciting 90% neutralization. A present, but suboptimal antibody response may be detrimental for disease course of COVID-19 [32] . For example, a study in non-human primates suggested that antibodies specific for other S protein epitopes could induce antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [33] . Further investigations are needed to determine whether using 90% neutralization as a reference-standard could provide additional insight into the relationship between neutralizing antibody responses and protection. Some evidence suggests that neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wane weeks after infection [34] . Therefore, the timing at which a patient's sample is assessed for neutralizing antibodies will be an important factor to consider when investigating whether or not a person has protective immunity against the virus. Furthermore, future research could compare the sVNT with other previously described surrogate platforms for use in such an algorithm for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies [35, 36] .@story_separate@The Genscript sVNT provides a high-throughput screening tool prior to confirmatory PRNT","There remains an urgent need for assays to quantify humoral protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 to understand the immune responses of COVID-19 patients, evaluate efficacy of vaccine candidates in clinical trials, and conduct large-scale epidemiological studies. The plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is the reference-standard for quantifying antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, the PRNT is logistically demanding, time-consuming, and requires containment level-3 facilities to safely work with live virus. In contrast, a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) manufactured by Genscript is a quick and simple assay that detects antibodies that inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction, crucial for virus entry into host cells. In this study, we evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity of the sVNT compared with the PRNT using both 50% and 90% SARS-CoV-2 neutralization as a reference-standard. We found that the sVNT provides a high-throughput screening tool prior to confirmatory PRNT testing for the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies."
"Coronavirus disease is an emerging respiratory disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus and was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [1] . Due to the threatening impact on health, society, and the economy, this infectious disease was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) [2] . The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has spread very quickly and, after four months, it has infected over 1.4 million people with more than 85,000 deaths in 212 countries and territories [3] . The health security of Vietnam, one of the countries that shares a border with China, is also threatened with 255 infected cases [4] . It urgently requires Vietnam's preparedness at the national and provincial levels, with outbreak prevention, and coordinated responses to extinguish the epidemic as rapidly as possible. To report on the ability of implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR), the State Party Self-Assessment Annual Reporting Tool (SPAR) was used for States Parties' annual reporting [5] . According to the SPAR 2018 report, Europe has a higher score of risk communication (66%) than Vietnam (60%), which presents a real-time exchange of information about disease outbreak between experts or officials and people facing the threats, and how to mitigate the effects of those threats [6] . Moreover, amid an unprecedented global health crisis, we have seen myriad information about COVID-19 circulating in communities, such as infodemics of misinformation concerning dwindling supplies of medical equipment, which increase anxiety within the community [7] . This situation indicates the urgent need to assess the coverage of health information in communities, as misleading information may hamper efforts to contain the epidemic. There is a diversity of information sources in metropolitan areas, such as mass media, the Internet, social networks, and peer interaction. Research on COVID-19 found that the general population in city areas preferred regular updates of health information via the Internet at the outbreak [8] and during the peak of epidemics [9] . However, those communication measures are not popular in rural areas, which may result in difficulties in COVID-19 information accessibility. Therefore, it is essential to assess the primary and useful information sources about the epidemic in order to help people in communities respond and make informed decisions to prevent and control COVID-19. Health personnel and community workers are at the front line of any outbreak response. They play critical roles in preventing and controlling any epidemic including the current COVID-19 epidemic [10] . Having the most up-to-date knowledge regarding COVID-19 is necessary in controlling the spread of COVID-19 through appropriate treatment for patients, and protection from infection due to frequent contact with patients [11] [12] [13] . The WHO also highlights the rights and responsibilities of health workers in order to protect occupational safety and health as they are at a high risk of infection and the source of transmission in the community [14] . Moreover, lessons learned from previous outbreaks and epidemics suggest that knowledge and attitudes regarding infectious diseases are related to the level of adherence to all control measures, which may limit the spread of those diseases. During the battle against COVID-19, all countries, even those with developed health systems, face a lack of human resources [15] and a threat to their resilience [16] . Thus, maximizing human resources is one of the keys to success. All health personnel, as well as medical students, can contribute to every stage of epidemic prevention [17] . Medical students who have knowledge of surveillance training, detection tests, and prevention measures will be a useful force in an emergency such as the COVID-19 epidemic [17] . Therefore, this study aimed to identify the information sources of COVID-19, and their contents, accessed by health workers and community workers in Vietnam. This result can inform preparedness efforts to help policymakers to deliver best practices in controlling the COVID-19 disease, particularly in Vietnam.@story_separate@A cross-sectional study utilizing web-based research was carried out from January to February 2020 in Vietnam. This study was a sub-analysis of the overall project on COVID-19 epidemic response assessment from January 2020. During this period of time, Vietnam was highly concerned about COVID-19 cases imported from Hubei, Wuhan, China-the core of the epidemic. Participants who met the following inclusion criteria took part in the survey: (1) aged 18 years old or above; (2) living in Vietnam for at least 6 months; (3) agreeing to be involved in the research by accepting the online informed consent agreement. Our study subjects were medical professionals, medical students, and community workers who were the most influential information receivers in supporting communities to eliminate COVID-19. Thus, in order to create changes in the cognition and behaviors of these subjects, risk communication plays an integral role. During epidemics, effective risk communication, which is the real-time exchange of information between community leaders and the people who are at risk, may allow people to understand and adopt protective behaviors [18] . Understanding and approaching risk communication is critical to perform best practices in preparedness (before), decrease the health risk (during), and disaster resilience (after) the COVID-19 pandemic [18, 19] . We utilized the formula of the respondent-driven sampling (RDS) technique for calculating the sample size of the study [20] . The expected proportion of people knowing the coronavirus family before the beginning of COVID-19 infection = 18.8% [12] , the margin of error = 0.05, the design effect = 3, and the expected sample size was 504 people. To take into consideration participants not answering completely, we added 25% to the sample size to compensate for people giving incomplete answers, and the expected sample size was 630. A total of 604 participants (medical staff, community workers, medical students) were selected for the sample, with a response rate of 95.9%. The recruitment process was based on core groups of the Vietnam Young Physician Association, Vietnam Youth Federation, and medical universities in Hanoi, Danang, and Ho Chi Minh City. We selected these groups to reflect the diversity of study subjects, including age, gender, and occupation. The core groups had a higher probability of knowing other people with similar background characteristics and who were eligible to take part in the survey. Community workers were all those working in community facilities. The government of Vietnam mobilized all the political systems, agencies, ministries, branches, and unions, especially those working in the communities-the front line of the combating. Therefore, community workers who are working in community facilities are also the priority subjects of our survey. Demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, marital status and living areas were obtained from the participants together with Work-related characteristics, which included the administration level, job title, and workplace location. COVID-19-related information channels: Participants self-reported the channels through which they accessed COVID-19 information, such as training programs at universities/workplaces/unions, news from residential areas/religious activities, mass media, or friends/relatives. Each channel was rated from 0 to 10 for the level of access. Moreover, participants were asked to sort the information content they received into three main categories including clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19; guidelines and policies on prevention and control of COVID-19; responsibilities of agencies/organizations/individuals regarding prevention and control of COVID-19. STATA 15.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) was used to analyze the data. We utilized the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine the construct validity of the questionnaire. The principal component analysis (PCA) was used to define factors with a threshold of an eigenvalue of 1.1 by Scree test, where the curve was flattened. An orthogonal varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization was applied for exploring the scale of items to increase the interpretability of study results. The cut-off point for factor loading was defined at a value of 0.4. We measured the internal consistency of each factor by Cronbach's alpha. Descriptive statistics was adopted to examine characteristic data which covered frequency, percent, mean, and standard deviation. Inferential statistics were applied to perform the comparison among three subject groups by T-test or Mann-Whitney test for quantitative variables and by the Fisher-exact test or Chi-square test for qualitative variables. A Tobit multivariable regression model was applied to identify factors associated with each type of channel. Poisson regression models were used to examine factors related to information content. To obtain reduced models, stepwise forward selection strategies were utilized with a log-likelihood ratio test at a p-value of 0.2. Statistical significance was defined at a p-value of less than 0.05. Participants were asked to provide informed consent prior to conducting the survey. Participants can refuse to take part in or withdraw from the survey at any time. All collected data would be coded and secured and only used for research purposes. Ethical consideration of the study was approved by the Scientific Council of Central Vietnam Youth Union Committee (372a QĐ/TWDTN-VNCTN). General information about the participants is presented in Table 1 . In total, 30% of participants were male. The majority of participants lived in urban areas (86.4%) and were single (87.7%). Nearly two-thirds of participants worked at the grassroots levels (district and commune levels). The mean age was 22.7 (SD = 5.4). Table 2 shows the results of the EFA model regarding information sources. Two items were defined from the factor analysis, including ""Information from organizations/agencies/associations"" and ""Mass media and peer-educators"". The first item consisted of five dimensions, with Cronbach's alpha = 0.88. The second item covered five aspects, and the Cronbach's alpha was also high at 0.85. About 15.2% of participants always accessed COVID-19 information from training programs at colleges/universities, followed by internet/online newspapers/social networks (13.7%) and 11.7% via radio/television. The mean score of the two items were 5.4 (SD = 2.4) and 6.6 (SD = 1.9), respectively. a Agencies include news agencies as well as organizations and associations. Table 3 depicts the construct validity of information content approached by participants. There were two dimensions determined after factor analysis, namely ""Clinical and pathogen characteristics"" and ""Regulations and policies related to COVID-19"". The values of Cronbach's alpha were 0.75 (three items) and 0.73 (four items), respectively. A high proportion of participants knew about the causes, transmission, and symptoms of COVID-19 (75.7%), followed by the physical health consequences of COVID-19 (66.3%). Only 30% of participants accessed the information regarding ""Guidelines and policies on prevention and control of COVID-19"". The primary COVID-19 information contents and the frequency of accessing information sources are described in Table 4 . Regarding the type of information, the percentage of participants obtained for ""Clinical and pathogen characteristics"" was higher than that of ""Regulations and policies related to COVID-19"" (85.3% and 67.8%, respectively). It is important to note that the proportion of participants who obtained information about ""Guidelines and policies on prevention and control of COVID-19"" was the lowest, at 29.8%. As was reasonably expected, this proportion among medical students was lower than the medical professionals and community workers groups, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01) because the latter groups could receive this information directly from their organization. Moreover, for access to information sources, the score of accessing via ""Mass media and peer-educators"" was higher than the score of approaching via organizations/ agencies/ associations (6.6 (SD = 1.9) and 5.4 (SD = 2.4), respectively). Accessing through ""Internet, online newspapers, social networks"" achieved the highest score (7.3 (SD = 2.0)). Table 5 reveals the factors associated with COVID-19 information sources and contents. Participants aged 25 years old and above were less likely to access COVID-19 epidemic information via both primary sources (Organizations/agencies/associations and mass media/peer-educators). Compared to single participants, those who lived with spouse/family were more likely to know about all of the COVID-19-related information, including ""Regulations/ policies"" and ""Clinical/pathogen characteristics"". Living in rural areas was associated with knowing about ""Regulations and policies related to COVID-19"". Regarding information sources, accessing via ""Mass media and peer-educators"" was positively related to obtaining information about both ""Regulations and policies related to COVID-19"" and ""Clinical and pathogen characteristics"".  This study showed the differences in accessibility of COVID-19 primary information via multiple channels among medical professionals, medical students, and community workers. ""Mass media and peer-educators"" was accessed more frequently, compared to ""Organizations/agencies/associations"". ""Guidelines and policies on prevention and control of COVID-19"" was the least accessed type of information. This means that in the urgent response to the COVID-19 epidemic, it is necessary to promote communication of up-to-date information on regulations and policies of COVID-19 prevention and control through mass media instead of focusing on the communication of the impact of the epidemic. Regarding the contents, a high percentage of participants knew about ""Clinical and pathogen characteristics of COVID-19"". This is consistent with a previous study conducted in Ho Chi Minh City (2020) among health workers, which revealed that large proportions of participants were aware of COVID-19 virus transmission, the main symptoms, and prevention measures [21] . Our findings were higher than the result of a previous survey of healthcare workers, which showed that only 39% of participants knew about COVID-19 epidemic transmission dynamics [11] . In our survey, participants reportedly heard about ""Regulations and policies related to COVID-19"" less than ""Clinical and pathogen characteristics"". But it is important to note that this survey was conducted at the early stage of the epidemic when Hubei was on lockdown, and the risk of COVID-19 transmission from China and elsewhere to Vietnam had materialized but was still low. [22] At this time, the first COVID-19 case, who was a foreigner from Wuhan, China, was detected in Vietnam on 24th January. The government of Vietnam focused on exploring the causes, transmission pathways, main symptoms, and protection from COVID-19. On 1st February, when the first case of domestic transmission was investigated, the government took the first action to announce the COVID-19 epidemic across the country. The highest measure implemented so far was to lock down the entire Son Loi commune, which had six COVID-19 cases, on 12th February, to limit the spread of coronavirus. When the number of COVID-19 cases exponentially increased, at the end of March, the Prime Minister decided to temporarily suspend entry for all foreigners and pose the regulation of ""social isolation"" for at least 15 days nationwide. Communication activities on regulations and policies related to COVID-19 prevention have also been strengthened after the Son Loi lockdown and social isolation, compared to the previous period-the time of conducting the study. However, when the government of Vietnam launched the emergency state for epidemics, the whole system had worked efficiently to respond to COVID-19. It was demonstrated by the high level of adherence to social distancing and ""social nearly quarantined"" at a very early stage [23] . Among the items of ""Regulations and policies related to COVID-19"", ""Guidelines and policies on prevention and control of COVID-19"" received the least attention from participants, especially medical students. Because medical students are a vital force in COVID-19 epidemic prevention, it is important to provide them not only with knowledge about the epidemiology of epidemics [17] but also updated healthcare policies related to COVID-19. As a lesson learned from previous epidemics, understanding the government policies and adhering strictly to those regulations plays a core role in effectively responding and controlling the epidemic [13, 24, 25] . Therefore, communication activities on regulations and policies related to the prevention and control of COVID-19 should be further promoted, in order to create an effective workforce and collaborating mechanism. Noticeably, ""Mass media and peer-eductors"" channels had a higher score of accessing COVID-19 information, compared to ""Organizations/ agencies/ associations"". Moreover, approaching information via ""Mass media and peer-eductors"" was more likely to obtain information regarding both ""Clinical and pathogen characteristics"" and ""Regulations and policies related to COVID-19"", compared to other sources. Mass media is a dominant information source in this information era since it can provide lightning-speed updates on the epidemic, particularly the number of cases and emergency announcements [26] . Online newspapers can aid in the dissemination of COVID-19 epidemic information, while mass media coverage-including television and printed newspapers-can elicit positive behavioral changes [27] . ""Internet, online newspapers, social networks"" was the information channel that was most frequently accessed. In fact, public health officials often utilize social networks to stay informed on official information released by government authorities as well as monitor the information authenticity posted by official accounts, which is vital in emergency responses [28] . Social networks and other population-based digital platforms can also offer additional data sources to detect disease outbreaks and cases via the public health surveillance systems [29] . Several implications can be drawn from our study. First, the participants in our study are a key force in COVID-19 prevention and control, and they were aware of their limitations in knowledge about COVID-19. Thus, it is urgent to strengthen training programs to enhance their capacity in epidemic response. Second, communication activities regarding regulations and policies of COVID-19 prevention and control should be further promoted in order for individuals to understand and strictly comply with those regulations fully. ""Mass media and peer-educators"" are useful information channels to convey timely messages about the epidemic to the people. However, this study does not provide information on the awareness and practice of the community. Therefore, to fully understand the capacity of systems and local communities to control COVID-19, household surveys can provide valuable information about the behaviors, attitudes, and practices of the population in each setting, and at different stages of the epidemic. Currently, the sources of COVID-19 information are well organized and conveyed by the WHO and the national healthcare agencies. We have suggested several highly accredited sources of information on COVID-19, which may be helpful for medical professionals and primary healthcare workers in training and staying informed ( Table 6 ). The strength of our study is the diversity of the respondents' backgrounds at the different levels of the health system. However, several limitations still exist in the study. The cross-sectional study design may limit the ability to infer causal relationships. Additionally, it was difficult to generalize our findings across the general population. Data were collected by self-reporting, which may lead to recall bias and social desirability. Although we are aware of the limitations about the representability of the sample population, in times of epidemics, it is not always feasible to obtain a nationally representative sample. Meanwhile, the design for rapid evidence to inform critical policies is vital, and we think that this study can provide a useful reference in Vietnam. In addition, behavioral aspects of the communities were not included in this manuscript, which may have indirect effects on medical professionals' behaviors in their respective workplaces.

""Regulations and policies related to COVID-19"" received the least attention while ""Mass media and peer-educators"" was the information channel most frequently accessed. This findings provide evidence for urgently formulating/re-designing training programs and communication activities to enhance the capacity of those people in rapidly responding to the COVID-19 epidemic.","Health personnel and community workers are at the front line of the COVID-19 emergency response and need to be equipped with adequate knowledge related to epidemics for an effective response.

Participants consumed most of their COVID-19 information via “Internet, online newspapers, social networks”. Our findings indicate an urgency to re-design training programs and communication activities for a more effective dissemination of information related to the COVID-19 epidemic or epidemics in general."
"The central nerve system (CNS) is protected from pathogens by effective immune responses and physical barriers including the blood brain barrier (BBB) and blood cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) barriers (1) . However, viral infection of the CNS does occur and may cause disease via direct viral-induced neuronal damage or by inflammatory-or immune-mediated pathologic mechanisms (1) . Brain cells express immune receptors that recruit leukocytes to the CNS upon detection an infection. The initial inflammatory response upon neurological infection frequently leads to an increase in the permeability of the BBB and potentially as a consequence severe neurological damage (1, 2) . Viral infections can induce serious CNS injury including encephalitis or severe acute demyelinating lesions (3) . In addition, viruses induce the production of chemokines and cytokines such as type I interferon (IFN) and the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-1 by neurons in vivo and in vitro (4) . To control the immune response and avoid immune mediated tissue damage, the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-10 is enhanced within the CNS upon viral infection. This tight regulation of immune responses within the CNS is important since neurons are highly specialized cells with a limited regenerative capacity (3) . Previous studies have shown the neurotropism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) and highlighted their ability to cause brain infection in patients with SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (3) . Considering the high degree of similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 should possess a similar mechanism for the induction of CNS injury and brain damage. In this review, an overview on the mechanism(s) by which SARS-CoV-2 accesses the CNS and induces neurological dysregulation is described.@story_separate@Neuro-invasion is a common feature of human coronaviruses (5) . Autopsy findings have confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV in the brain tissue and CSF of patients with severe SARS or MERS by electron microscopy, reverse transcription PCR and by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (6) (7) (8) . Interestingly, the RNA of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) was detected in the brain tissue of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients (9, 10) and their putative role in chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), headache and MS has recently been suggested (11) . Coronaviruses are able to locate to the brain via synapseconnected routes. For example, coronaviruses may first infect peripheral nerve terminals and reach the CNS via retrograde transport (12) . Neurotropism of coronaviruses was first described with swine hemaglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) (13) . Oronasal inoculation of HEV in suckling piglets indicated primary viral replication in nasal epithelial cells, tonsils and the small intestine. Subsequently, the virus was transported to the CNS and brain stem via retrograde transport along the peripheral nervous system. Viral spread into the cerebrum, spinal cord and neural plexuses of the stomach was also observed in the later stages of HEV infection which affected the peristaltic function of the digestive tract, resulting in anorexia and vomiting (13) . In experimental models, HCoV-OC43 was able to reach the CNS via the olfactory route by neuron-to-neuron transmission and to replicate in the brain stem and spinal cord (14) . The infectivity of adults with a normal immune system to HCoV-OC43 results in a mild chronic or latent disease but in immunocompromised individuals and children this virus may lead to lethal acute encephalitis (15) . Furthermore, intranasal infection of mice with SARS or MERS-CoVs evoked rapid histopathological changes in the brain stem and thalamus (7) . This further supports the concept that viral transmission to these brain areas was predominantly via the olfactory nodes (8) . Considering the high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 might show a similar mechanism of CNS invasion (16) . Non-neural cells in the olfactory system express high levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and for this reason can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 (17) . These cells have a supportive role for mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and can transfer the virus to OSNs through axonal transport (14) . This process enables the penetration of neuroinvasive viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 into the brain and the generation of a local inflammatory response which may act as trigger of neurodegenerative diseases (18, 19) . Thus, the early occurrence of loss of smell or hyposmia during COVID-19 infections should be taken into consideration as a marker for subsequent CNS involvement (20) . Neuronal entry of SARS-CoV-2 may also occur via a neuropilin-1 (NRP1)-related pathway. NRP1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor and can bind furin-cleaved substrates (21) . NRP1 is highly expressed in endothelial and epithelial cells of the respiratory and olfactory systems (22) and in vagal and other sensory neurons (23) . The coronavirus spike (S1) protein contains a furin cleavage site (24) which suggests that it has the potential to activate NRP1 and gain cell entry (25) . Interestingly, monoclonal antibody against NRP1 significantly reduces viral infectivity significantly (21) . Another suggested mechanism accounting for viral entry into the brain is the systemic circulation and disruption of the BBB (26) . ACE2 receptors are widespread throughout the brain stem including regions with high vascularization and a leaky BBB would allow viral infection that may subsequently induce or accelerate neurodegeneration (26) . Noroviruses can infect the endothelial cells that are one of the three cell types that contribute to the BBB and increase the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This, in turn, decreases the expression of tight junction proteins resulting in increased permeability of the BBB (27) . Furthermore, replication and budding of the virus, along with the subsequent expression of inflammation cytokines, will disrupt the normal function of the BBB and enable virus access to the CNS (15) . This mechanism is observed with viruses such as hepatitis E virus (28) and encephalitic alpha viruses (29) . Because of the high expression of ACE2 in cellular components of the BBB, it is suggested that the disruption of BBB by SARS-CoV-2 may play the main role in the central and peripheral nervous system damage seen in severe COVID-19 (30) . Rather than destruction of the BBB, other viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (31) and Zika virus (32, 33) enter the CNS through a Trojan horse mechanism in which they infected monocytes which shuttle them across the BBB. Coronaviruses have the same potential as HIV to constitute a reservoir in leukocytes and use them as carrier to spread into the other tissues (34) . There are reports indicating that ACE2-expressing CD68 + CD169 + macrophages may act as a Trojan horse and contribute to viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 (34) although this needs to be confirmed (Figure 1) . Furthermore, the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can cross the BBB and reach CNS via absorptive mediated transcytosis (AMT) in mice (35) . Viral infection can cause aggregation α-synuclein and trigger α-synucleinopthies. Viral replication triggers cytokine storm and case to vascular leakage and BBB disruption. Virus infection may trigger brain hypoxia during which hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α) is activated in the brain and promotes the production of IL-6 TNF-α and M1 MQ polarization at the site of infection. Hypxia in the brain impairs metabolic pathways and further promotes neurodegeneration and brain injury. Headache, dizziness, chronic fatigue, musculoskeletal pain with fever and taste and smell disorders are reported as the most common neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients. Dry cough is also a common symptom of COVID-19 and is considered as a neurological consequence. Viral infection of the sensory nerves and of the airway vagus nerve promote neuroinflammation and neuroimmune interactions that probably initiate cough (36) . The occurrence of cough together with fatigue, dyspnoea and pain further confirms the CNS injury in COVID-19 patients (36) . Chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia (fatigue accompanied by musculoskeletal pain, sleep, memory and mood concerns) in COVID-19 patients have also been associated with alterations in the processing of pain and sensory signals by the brain (37) in these patients. The persistence of these neurological symptoms for many months in COVID-19 recovered subjects is described as ""post-COVID syndrome (PCS)"" or long COVID (38, 39) . Some patients also struggle with clouding of consciousness so-called mental fog (involving memory and focusing problems and a lack of mental clarity) for a long time after recovery which exert a deleterious effect on their daily activities (40, 41) . The mechanism behind the post-COVID syndrome has not been completely clear but it may be the result of neuroinflammatory reactions in the brain. Brain MRI imaging (42) in the patients with long COVID have shown cortical signal abnormalities and neuroinflammation. On the other hand PET imaging has shown bilateral hypometabolism in the olfactory gyrus, brain stem and the cerebellum (43) in patients. Analysis of 19 mild and 32 severe COVID-19 patients with no specific neurological symptoms during acute infection and no obvious lesions seen using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 3 months after discharge indicated decreased cerebral blood flow and the presence of brain microstructure changes. Changes including decreased cortical thickness, white manner microstructure, particularly in the frontal and limbic systems, were more evident in subjects with severe disease and correlated with the degree of systemic inflammation observed (44) . ACE2 expression in the human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons and in P2RX3 (purinergic receptor P2X3) pain receptors and the subsequent damage of these nerves upon viral infection might be responsible for the post-COVID neurological symptoms (45, 46) . Although it is too early to describe the challenge and clinical features of PCNS as a novel syndrome there is a clear need for neurological monitoring of COVID-19 survivors and further studies to managing the future challenge in this issue. There is a large body of evidence suggesting a role for specific pathogens, especially viruses, in the initiation or facilitation of neurodegenerative disease. The early evidence for a viral cause of Parkinsonism was during an outbreak of encephalitis lethargica (EL) in 1918-30 that occurred during and after the 1918 influenza outbreak (47). In this case, a large number of patients with an acute episode of EL developed post-encephalitic Parkinsonism (48) . In addition, nasal administration of the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus into mice results in microglial activation and α-synuclein aggregation in virus-infected brain areas that persisted long after the resolution of the infection. Infection also resulted in a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra (SN) (49) . To date, 36.4% of patients with COVID-19 have shown neurological symptoms (50) and viral particles have been detected in the postmortem brains of COVID-19 victims (26). The first case of SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological injury was a 24-year-old man with meningitis who was admitted to hospital on the 9th day after the onset of symptoms with convulsions and unconsciousness. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the patient's CSF but was not detectable in the nasopharyngeal swab (51) . COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological defects vary from non-specific to specific symptoms (52, 53) and autopsy results have shown edema and neuronal degeneration in the brain tissue of COVID-19 victims (50) . However, the pathophysiological mechanism behind the SARS-CoV-2associated encephalitis is not fully understood. The virus may induce nerve damage through several mechanisms including direct infection (54) or an immunologic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (55) . The induction of the type I IFNs provide the first line of immune defense against CNS viral infection (56) which consequently trigger and regulate the specific adaptive immune responses to limit viral spread (57) . However, other defense mechanisms may exist as well. Viral infection, for example, can lead to an aggregation of proteins including α-synuclein as an anti-viral defense mechanism, which can trigger α-synucleinopthies (58) . Dopaminergic neurons are more vulnerable to degeneration by this mechanism and promote α-synuclein uptake upon viral neuroinflammation. Increased α-synuclein levels restricts infection of the brain by RNA viruses following West Nile virus and SARS-CoV-1 infection (59) . Due to the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to these other viruses, it is possible that a similar up-regulation of α-synuclein might occur with SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to widespread neurodegeneration (60) . α-Synuclein is recognized by a number of toll-like receptors (TLRs) including TLR1-4,−7 and−8. TLRs detect pathogenor damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) that accrue due to cell damage and can trigger a chronic inflammatory process (61, 62) . α-Synuclein aggregation also leads to microglial activation, a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases (63) , that further promotes neuronal damage and apoptosis by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic reactive oxygen intermediates (64) . Hyposmia and gastrointestinal manifestations, which are common in SARS-CoV-2 infection, are non-motor symptoms of PD during the prodromal phase. It is in this phase of the disease that α-synuclein deposition within the anterior olfactory nucleus and neurodegeneration begins (65) (66) (67) . Furthermore, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to physically interact with the mTOR translational repressor, La-Ribonucleoprotein 1 (LARP1) (68) . LARP1 plays an important role in the autophagy, glucose metabolism and mitochondrial functions in the neurons of the brain (69). Brain hypoxia is another common feature among COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress. Hypoxia induces oxidative damage to neural cells and causes widespread neurodegeneration (70) . Based on clinical data obtained from two cases reported by Jaunmuktane and colleagues, severe COVID-19 patients may be at a greater risk of microvascular injury and ischemic lesions due to presence of hypoxia (71) . Acute hypoxemia may promote a hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and induce demyelination and production of white matter microhemorrhages. Furthermore, prolonged hypoxia may lead to BBB destruction and leaky capillaries, which promote cerebral microhemorrhages. The defective function and subsequent death of oligodendroglial cells is another consequence of a hypoxic microenvironment within the brain which, in turn, results in demyelination of white matter (72) . Interestingly Hypoxia can impair metabolic pathways in the brain as well and activate immune cells that are usually maintained in a resting state during normoxia. The hypoxia microenvironment in the brain actives hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α) which is a key regulator of oxygen homeostasis and triggers adoptive responses under hypoxic conditions (73) . HIF-1α down regulates the expression of ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and so can exert a protective effect by blocking of the cell entry gate of SARS-CoV-2 (74, 75) . However, the upregulation of HIF-1a may act as a doubleedged sword during SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. HIF-1α mediates cytokine storm and mass production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6 at the inflammatory site and increases the transcription of M1 macrophage-associated genes such as TNF-α, IL-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS) at the site of inflammation. In addition, HIF-1α modulates the activation and life span of many immune cells including neutrophils and dendritic cells to promote M1 polarization (76) . The cytokine storm triggers neuronal damage, epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis, vascular leakage and BBB disruption (77) . In rare occasions the cytokine storm may lead to BBB disruption without direct viral invasion (78) . Moreover, disruption of the peripheral BBB increases α-synuclein uptake from the circulation into the brain (Figure 1) . Immunity cell activation and the cytokine storm are proposed as key mechanisms driving the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), increased pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 suppress the phagocytic activity of microglial cells and cause the accumulation and deposition of beta-amyloid A (79) . In addition, increased levels of inflammatory mediators including TNF-α are found in the CSF and in brain tissue of patients with PD as well as in the non-human primate models of the disease (80) . A similar pro-inflammatory pattern with increased IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α is seen in the CSF of MS patients and was associated with the severity of damage at the time of diagnosis (81) . Interestingly, men with higher plasma levels of IL-6 have an increased risk of developing PD (67, 82) . IL-6 is highly overexpressed in severe COVID-19 patients that may suggest a plausible therapeutic target to prevent the neurological consequences and brain damage seen in these patients. Although limiting viral replication leads to a rapid and effective immune response it needs to be tightly regulated to avoid tissue damage. Given the highly specialized functions and limited regenerative capacity of neurons, tight regulation of the CNS immune response is critical (3). The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 limits the expansion of tissue lesions during chronic viral infection of the CNS (83) . Indeed, the pathologic process of virusinduced demyelination is alleviated by exogenous IL-10 early after disease onset and highlights its potential for the treatment of viral encephalitis and COVID-19 (84) . CD8 T cells are the major source of IL-10 production in the airways following infection of murine models with influenza A virus (SV5) and respiratory syncytial virus (85, 86) . IL-10 is produced transiently by CD8 T cells in the brain of coronavirus-infected mice at the peak of infection. The expression of IL-10 in CD8 T cells; requires a strong antigenic stimulation and signaling through the MAPK pathway. Thus, the production of IL-10 by highly activated CD8 T cells functions to suppress the localized imune response when the viral antigen concentration and inflammatory responses are increased which reduces immunopathological damage (87) . T helper cells (CD4+ Tcells) can produce IL-10 following antigen stimulation and high T cell receptor (TCR) ligation (87) . Development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells is dependent upon IL-12 stimulation via STAT4 and ERK-dependent pathways. Repeated TCR triggering leads to maximal levels of IL-10 production by Th1 cells (88) . Futhermore, during high dose bacterial infection and during a cytokine storm, macrophages can produce high levels of IL-10 and miR-155 which orchestrate an inhibitory process protecting the host from immune cellmediated damage (89) . In the patients susceptible to a cytokine storm, macrophages and immune cells have significantly lower IL-10 and miR-155 expression following bacterial challenge (89) . Systemic production of IL-10 following the onset of a cytokine storm may result in ""immunoparalysis"" that is associated with decreased number and reduced function of neutrophils and monocytes (90) in association with pyroptotic death of these cells (77, 91) . In addition, the reduced peripheral blood lymphocyte count, that mainly reflects a loss of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients, is highly associated with the severity of disease. The mechanism underlying this process is unclear but it may be due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect T cells directly. However, patients that survive the initial cytokine storm may be unable to recover from immunoparalysis. COVID-19 patients with low monocyte surface expression of HLA-DR have a high mortality rate a few days after the onset of sepsis and the cytokine storm. Approaches to reverse immunosuppression should be considered in these patients (92) . Viruses can break down the body's self-tolerance and trigger autoimmune reactions in predisposed individuals by multiple mechanisms including structural mimicking or bystander activation (93) . Bystander activation is a common mechanism in neurological disorders. The persistent and hyperactive immune response to a viral infection may sequester and expose autoantigens to the immune system resulting in a localized pro-inflammatory environment (93, 94) . Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 may trigger the production of autoantibodies and develop autoinflammatory reactions in genetic predisposed individuals (95) . For example, antiphospholipid (APL) antibodies (96) , anti-52 kDa and anti-60 kDa anti-Sjögren's-syndrome-related antigen A autoantibodies (Ro-SSA) (97), antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (98) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) (99, 100) have all been detected in the serum of COVID-19 patients and which may induce future autoimmune disorders. In addition to the production of auto-antibodies, preexisting antibodies also may complicate the pathologic condition. Autoimmune reactions can trigger the neurodegeneration process through autoantibodies mediated mechanisms (101) . Immunoglobulins (IGs) or immune complexes can be neurotoxic by inducing proinflammatory responses in the brain parenchyma through microglial activation leading to neuronal damage (101, 102) . For example IgG in lupus serum induces M1 polarization of brain microglia and inflammatory responses (103) . Furthermore, patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases have a significantly higher risk of neurodegenerative diseases (104) and autoantibodies that target brain specific proteins have been found in the CSF of patients with AD (101, 105) . An autoimmune background is also suggested for PD. In patients with PD, the presence of serum autoantibodies against catecholamine-based melanins have been identified and are responsible for the neuronal loss by autoimmune mechanisms (106) . Furthermore, in MS the increased migration of autoreactive lymphocytes across the BBB results in persistent neurodegeneration (107) . Overall, the current evidence suggests that neuronal damage in COVID-19 patients might be secondary to the immune response due to the presence of autoantibodies rather than to a direct cytopathic effect of the virus (99) . Some cases of Guillain-Barrè syndrome have been reported following SARS-CoV-2 infection (108, 109) . Guillain-Barrè syndrome is an immune-mediated pathogenicity and mostly develops after a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection (110) . Formation of cross-reacting anti-ganglioside antibodies is the major mechanism driving the demyelinating polyneuropathy or a motor axonal neuropathy (110, 111) . Influenza A virus also triggers autoimmune CNS damage with the lung acting as an inflammatory niche in which auto-aggressive T cells gain the capacity to enter CNS (107) . Thus, the persistence of the virus or of viral proteins may continue to stimulate the immune system and perpetuate chronic demyelination (112) . Together, these findings suggest a potential link between neurological defects and autoimmune reactions upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, induced autoimmune reactions or the persistence of autoantibodies may exacerbate pathological states within the CNS. Current evidence suggests that pre-existing CNS comorbidities increase the severity and neurological damage of COVID-19. The association between neurological comorbidity and COVID-19 severity varies according to the presence of neurological disorders and patients with cerebrovascular and cognitive impairments have a higher severity of infection and a greater need for ICU admission (113, 114) . Patients with MS exhibit an increased severity of disease and the infection contributes to disease relapses and/or the worsening of neurological manifestations (115, 116) . Preexisting autoimmune diseases and the presence of autoantibodies could also complicate the inflammatory condition and promote brain injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection (96) . The impaired BBB integrity in AD and MS patients may allow autoantibodies to more readily access the brain and trigger neuro-inflammation (101, 117) . Preexisting cardiovascular diseases also increase the neurological injuries induced by SARS-CoV-2 (118) . ACE2 usage by the virus and receptor shedding reduced cell surface expression of ACE2 and endothelial dysfunction. Dysregulation of ACE2 enzymatic function may also lead to dysregulation of the brain renin-angiotensin system (B-RAS) whilst overexpression of Ang II and dysregulated blood pressure can impact on brain endothelial cell dysfunction (119) . High levels of Ang II can also trigger an increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels and promote a cytokine storm within the brain (120) . This suggests that the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities exacerbates these conditions and may account for the severe neurological injuries induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age also plays a determinant role in neurological injury since older individuals have reduced expression of ACE2 and higher levels of angiotensin II. SARS-CoV-2 infection may induce a severe inflammatory environment with increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines which can actively transfer to the CNS and activate glial neuroinflammatory responses and trigger neuronal damage (121, 122) . Recent studies highlight the role of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency on the severity of disease. A low level of vitamin D is associated with COVID-19 severity and immune dysregulation that may impact upon neurological damage (123) . Finally, the gut-brain axis may also contribute to the neurological comorbidity of COVID-19 since gut dysbiosis influences the formation of the cytokine storm within the brain (124) . This suggests that improving the gut microbiota using probiotics may provide a novel opportunity to control neural damage induced by SARS-CoV-2.@story_separate@The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a wide range of pathophysiologies. Although SARS-CoV-2 is known primarily as a respiratory virus, a wide range of neurological symptoms have been associated with this virus. Alongside a neurotropic behavior and neuroinvasive properties, the virus may trigger neurological defects by triggering a cytokine storm. Pre-existing CNS comorbidities and autoimmune diseases place the patients at a higher risk for developing neurological symptoms upon infection. Although many biological parameters including age, the presence of cardiovascular diseases as well as malnutrition and vitamin deficiency are associated with COVID-19; a causal link has not yet been defined. Current evidence strongly suggests that patients surviving COVID-19 are at high risk for the subsequent development of neurological disease. There are concerns that even when the pandemic is over, SARS-CoV-2 might persist within the CNS and cause chronic and latent infection in a large proportion of the population including those who suffered only mild respiratory symptoms. Further studies are needed to investigate potential correlations between acute or mild COVID-19 infections and long-term neurological effects in the population.","The new coronavirus disease COVID-19 was identified in December 2019. It subsequently spread across the world with over 125 M reported cases and 2.75 M deaths in 190 countries. COVID-19 causes severe respiratory distress; however, recent studies have reported neurological consequences of infection by the COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2 even in subjects with mild infection and no initial neurological effects. It is likely that the virus uses the olfactory nerve to reach the CNS and that this transport mechanism enables virus access to areas of the brain stem that regulates respiratory rhythm and may even trigger cell death by alteration of these neuronal nuclei. In addition, the long-term neuronal effects of COVID-19 suggest a role for SARS-CoV-2 in the development or progression of neurodegerative disease as a result of inflammation and/or hypercoagulation. In this review recent findings on the mechanism(s) by which SARS-CoV-2 accesses the CNS and induces neurological dysregulation are summarized."
"The SARS-CoV-2 viral pandemic has had a profound impact on health service provision internationally, including on antenatal care (1) . Impacts vary according to national health resources, models of antenatal care, severity of the pandemic and regional containment policies and by the ability of the healthcare system to rapidly adapt and transform. The direct health impact of the pandemic on routine antenatal care, particularly for high-risk pregnancies, is critical to consider. Women with gestational diabetes (GDM), a condition defined by glucose intolerance diagnosed for the first time in pregnancy (2) , are one of the largest groups of highrisk women accessing antenatal care in the hospitals on a frequent basis (3, 4, 5) , due to increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (6) . While efforts to limit viral transmission through physical distancing and minimizing the strain on redeployed healthcare resources are important, it is crucial to recognize and plan for disruption to routine antenatal screening, detection, monitoring, prevention and management and subsequent adverse health outcomes for women with GDM (1, 7) . Importantly, healthcare providers must be aware of the inequitable impact of crises and health service limitations and consider this in personalised care (7) . Outside the pandemic scenario, screening for GDM with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is offered either to all women (universal screening) or based on risk factors (selective screening), and the criteria used to diagnose GDM vary (8, 9) . The OGTT usually involves long waits at hospital and involves a dedicated phlebotomy service. The test has a high sensitivity (low false negative rate) for GDM diagnosis (10, 11) . Due to concerns that universal OGTT screening using the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria overdiagnoses GDM without clear clinical benefit (12) , many European guidelines recommend risk factor-based screening (13) . Once GDM is diagnosed, usual antenatal care involves frequent face-to-face consultations with diabetes and/or obstetric teams, lifestyle and potential pharmacological interventions requiring multiple visits, and 4-weekly scans to monitor fetal growth. Additional postpartum visits for tests (OGTT, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or HbA1C) are required to detect conversion to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in women with GDM (9, 14) . Usual evidence-based approaches in developing new models of care that ideally require stakeholder engagement, co-design and evaluation are all seriously curtailed during the pandemic. Therefore, at this time pragmatic changes are required to all stages of GDM care including screening and diagnosis, management and follow-up. These must balance the need to prevent GDMrelated complications against limiting the risk of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission to mothers in overstretched health systems. We now explore this balance and suggest risk mitigation strategies allowing identification of women with overt diabetes early in pregnancy, and risk of GDM through alternative screening approaches and modified pathways for monitoring, management and follow-up. These represent general suggested approaches. They will require tailored implementation strategies that may vary by country, by baseline local GDM management practices and by regional pandemic severity. Our recommendations are only in the context of the pandemic, and we emphasize that diagnosis and care should realign to current guidelines when this is safe and feasible.@story_separate@In an evolving pandemic with a highly infectious virus, screening OGTTs involve high exposure risks and health service burden. The routine use of OGTTs for GDM screening needs to be carefully considered in the context of local pandemic impact including community transmission rates. Where it is no longer safe or feasible current evidence does not support a single alternative test. We thus propose a strategy that utilizes alternative simpler tests and mitigation 'safety-nets' balancing GDM detection with minimizing of health service burden and viral exposure of women ( Fig. 1 ): 1. Undertake additional tests at booking (HbA1C and random plasma glucose (RPG)), primarily to detect overt diabetes, and identify those at highest risk for GDM; 2. Avoid OGTT at 24-28 weeks and instead offer HbA1C along with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or RPG; 3. Identify and monitor women with past GDM; 4. Apply a personalized risk calculator for universal screening of GDM; 5. Monitor for complications of any GDM missed in routine care; and 6. Real-time evaluation of the impact of pandemic screening strategy implementation. We recommend that centers follow their current guidelines on whom to screen (selective or universal). For centers who currently use universal screening and feel this to be unsafe during the pandemic, we recommend using selective screening in conjunction with our proposed testing strategy. We have taken into account the following in providing suggestions for GDM screening in a pandemic: feasibility in an overstretched healthcare environment; minimizing travel, number of visits and duration of exposure for screening; characteristics of the screening tests. Highly sensitive tests (low false negative rate) with low specificity will increase the numbers of false positives and burden the system, while highly specific tests (low false positive rate) with low sensitivity may miss GDM, risking adverse outcomes for mother and fetus. Given the risk that some GDM may not be detected with the proposed changes in screening strategy, all women should be encouraged to follow a healthy lifestyle including diet throughout pregnancy (15, 16). Early screening for GDM is primarily designed to identify women who had undetected diabetes before pregnancy, given the risks of undiagnosed (largely type 2) diabetes in pregnancy, but there is no universal or risk factorbased screening in the first trimester in many countries in normal times. In the UK, the NICE guidelines recommend OGTT in first or early second trimester for women with previous GDM to aid early detection (9) . Our proposal for early screening in a pandemic aims to identify women who would otherwise be diagnosed with abnormal glucose concentration only at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy. At booking, HbA1c and RPG can be performed in addition to usual booking bloods, to detect the highest risk groups. We suggest the following thresholds and actions: • HbA1c ≥48 mmol/mol (≥6.5%) or RPG ≥11.1 mmol/L (≥200 mg/dL): treat as pre-existing diabetes. HbA1c ≥48 mmol/mol (≥6.5%) in nonpregnant adults is universally accepted for diagnosing overt diabetes (17, 18) , and HbA1c tends to fall slightly in pregnancy. In interpreting results, consideration of individual risk for T2D is advisable. Care should be taken where HbA1c is unreliable, such as in beta thalassemia and severe anemia (19, 20) . As the recommended antenatal routine booking blood tests are not taken in the fasting state, we suggest pragmatic use of RPG. A threshold of ≥11.1 mmol/L (≥200 mg/ dL) is aligned with diagnostic criteria in the nonpregnant population (17, 21) . • HbA1c 41-47 mmol/mol (5.9-6.4%) or RPG 9-11 mmol/L (162-200 mg/dL): consider managing using the GDM pathway: An HbA1c between 41-47 mmol/mol (5.9-6.4%) confers risk for future T2D in nonpregnant women (17, 22) . Our suggestions are based on the need to avoid unnecessary strain to the healthcare system through use of unduly low diagnostic cut-offs. We suggest that early GDM could also be diagnosed by an RPG of 9-11 mmol/L (162-200 mg/dL) for pragmatic reasons. RPG is considered a better predictor of GDM at 24-28 weeks than body mass index alone (23). Screening for GDM with OGTT is widely accepted at 24-28 weeks' gestation, and the majority of evidence on (1) . Combining FPG with HbA1C may improve the detection rate. We consider this reasonable and pragmatic, as women who are negative for GDM on OGTT (IADPSG criteria) and have high HbA1c at delivery (≥39 mmol/mol, ≥5.7%) are at higher risk of maternal and offspring adverse outcomes (24) . The proposed combination of FPG and HbA1c criteria are expected to identify a similar number of women accessing health services with GDM, to current practice of NICE diagnosed GDM with OGTT. Rates of short-term adverse pregnancy outcomes (LGA, stillbirth, preterm delivery and cesarean section rates) are broadly similar (1). Maintaining existing FPG thresholds may be preferable, and services may consider lower thresholds consistent with the IADPSG diagnostic criteria (FPG ≥5.1), if resources allow. Women with a history of GDM have a high risk of subsequent GDM and of T2D. The risk of GDM in a subsequent pregnancy is approximately 50%, or up to 80% in some series (25, 26, 27) . We therefore suggest that booking blood tests should be completed as outlined above, to detect pre-existing overt diabetes or early GDM where HbA1c, FPG or RPG thresholds are exceeded. If resources allow, healthcare services may consider regular glucose monitoring of women with a history of GDM, without the need for testing at 24-28 weeks, combined with early lifestyle interventions. Risk calculators enable assessment of personal risk of developing GDM, and many have been externally validated (28) . Of these, the Monash risk calculator has been robustly developed, internally and externally validated, integrated into a simple accessible online tool, undergone implementation research, has been implemented into routine care and is being integrated into national guidelines in the Netherlands (28, 29,30, M P H Koster, personal communication). It includes clinical characteristics routinely collected at booking (maternal age, body mass index, ethnicity, previous GDM, family history of diabetes). This risk calculator has good discrimination (C-statistic 0.77; 95% confidence interval 0.73−0.81) and is well calibrated (slope 1.1) for predicting GDM (28) . Due to the likely prolonged nature of the pandemic, although this may be a new practice for many services across the world, it is simple to implement, is evidence based and is worthy of consideration here and moving forward. We recommend that women identified as having any of the following features at any time during pregnancy are screened for GDM, re-screened if they have previously had a normal GDM screening test, or commence routine glucose monitoring as per GDM protocols: heavy glycosuria (≥2+ glucose); symptoms of diabetes (e.g. thirst, polydipsia/polyuria, nocturia); large-for-gestational-age fetus or polyhydramnios on ultrasound. It has been shown that accelerated fetal growth occurs well before diagnosis of GDM (31) and increased abdominal wall thickness as a surrogate for fetal adiposity is seen at least 4-5 weeks prior to the biochemical diagnosis of GDM (32) . However, this needs further evaluation as a screening test for GDM and services could conduct real-time audit for complications that may be due to missed GDM. With sophisticated real-time data sharing and analysis increasingly available, evaluation of the impact of these pandemic strategies is both feasible and vital, to iteratively monitor and improve outcomes. Antenatal care for pregnant women with GDM should, wherever possible, minimize the need for hospital-based care, support public health measures concerning physical distancing and self-isolation and reduce health service burden. Women at high risk of GDM, such as those with https://eje.bioscientifica.com previous GDM, or those identified on a risk prediction tool, could be offered early dietary and lifestyle advice (via remote delivery including telehealth consultations). While the individual RCTs show mixed results, overall these interventions are effective in limiting excess gestational weight gain (GWG) and our IPD shows (59 studies; n = 16885) that it can prevent GDM and its complications (33, 34) . Once GDM has been diagnosed, education to facilitate healthy diet and physical activity is important. Healthy GWG, control of blood glucose concentration, and monitoring, prevention and management of GDMrelated complications should remain the cornerstone of antenatal GDM management (9, 35) . Centres with traditional face-to-face GDM education sessions are encouraged to transition to remote delivery, using mobile health tools, interactive webinars and online resources. However, after the pandemic, patient and public engagement with health professionals will be needed to co-design the optimal approach to lifestyle intervention in high-risk pregnancies and GDM. Best-quality evidence, including on cost effectiveness and implementation will be needed to guide delivery at scale. After initial education and commencement of lifestyle measures, antenatal care in GDM should be stratified by risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (36) . Pragmatic stratification considers adequacy of blood glucose control, need for pharmacologic treatment and the presence of additional risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes such as obesity. We consider women with GDM on diet, with well-controlled blood glucose levels and no other risk factors to be at low risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We propose that these women are managed in routine antenatal care pathways, potentially in the community, if aligned with regional models of care (Fig. 2) . Women with GDM requiring treatment with metformin and/or insulin (depending on local protocols), or those with other identified risk factors, are considered to be at higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes than those on diet alone. We propose that such women are routinely reviewed by the specialist diabetes team. Where usual practice involves frequent face-to-face reviews, a transition to remote review with a focus on assessing glycemia and therapy titration should be considered. Digital blood glucose monitoring systems with demonstrated safety and  Postpartum screening for persistent diabetes (T2D, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) or, less commonly, type 1 diabetes (T1D)) can occur immediately postpartum with either FPG or 24-h capillary blood glucose testing in those at high risk (increased BMI, high insulin dose in pregnancy and high-risk ethnicity). Postpartum OGTTs should ideally be delayed until public health measures for control of the pandemic have been eased. More timely postpartum screening for persistent diabetes during the pandemic could be considered where there are significantly increased risk factors for T2D, concerns for T1D or MODY, or where a woman is planning an early subsequent pregnancy, in which case pre-conceptional diagnosis would modify care. In this setting an HbA1c at 3-6 months postpartum could be completed in the community. Due to the emerging nature of the COVID-19 crisis this document is not based on extensive systematic review or meta-analysis, but on rapid expert consensus. The document should be considered as guidance only, and it is not intended to determine an absolute standard of medical care. Healthcare staff need to consider individual circumstances when devising the management plan for a specific patient. @story_separate@We suggest pragmatic options for GDM screening, diagnosis and management during the pandemic, with integration into background routine antenatal care. We highlight that risk-stratified approaches can enable personalized care for individual women, and note that inequity and health disparities are amplified during a crisis, requiring recognition and consideration in providing care. Adapted GDM screening and diagnostic strategies and antenatal management pathways during the pandemic need to be considered in the context of local practice and iteratively evaluated and improved, both at the individual and at the population level, through analysis of real-time outcome data for women and their offspring. Evaluation should focus on changes to care prompted by the pandemic to avoid harm, capture high-value elements and inform post-pandemic care.","The COVID-19 pandemic has required rapid transformation and adaptation of healthcare services. Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are one of the largest high-risk groups accessing antenatal care. In reformulating the care offered to those with GDM, there is a need to balance the sometimes competing requirement of lowering the risk of direct viral transmission against the potential adverse impact of service changes. We suggest pragmatic options for screening of GDM in a pandemic setting based on blood tests, and risk calculators applied to underlying risk factors. Alternative models for antenatal care provision for women with GDM, including targeting high-risk groups, early lifestyle interventions and remote monitoring are provided. Testing options and their timing for postpartum screening in women who had GDM are also considered. Our suggestions are only applicable in a pandemic scenario, and usual guidelines and care pathways should be re-implemented as soon as possible and appropriate."
"Since first emerging in Saudi Arabia in June 2012, cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection have been reported from 26 countries. Saudi Arabia has the largest number of MERS cases, followed by South Korea. As of 2 February 2016, 1638 MERS cases, including 587 deaths (case fatality rate:~36%), have been reported to the WHO [1] [2] [3] . Cases of MERS kept increasing in Saudi Arabia and reached at 1297 as of 24 February 2016 [4] . Similar to other coronaviruses (CoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5] and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [6] , MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus and originates from bats, suggesting that bats are the most likely natural reservoir of MERS-CoV [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, unlike SARS-CoV, which utilizes small animals, such as palm civets and raccoon dogs, as its intermediate hosts [11, 12] , MERS-CoV depends on dromedary camels [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Nevertheless, human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV does occur, and unprepared health-care facilities could become a major source for human infection and transmission (Figure 1 ), as shown by the incidence of MERS-CoV cases in South Korea in 2015 [1, [18] [19] [20] [21] . Several family clusters infected with MERS-CoV have also been revealed [22] [23] [24] [25] . Recently, MERS-CoV has been added to the NIAID list as a Category C Priority Pathogen [26] . This places it in the same category as SARS-CoV and, as such, it has the potential to be used as a biological weapon. Therefore, steps toward prevention strategies need to be taken, particularly the development of effective and safe vaccines. CoV genera are classified as α, β, γ, and δ ( Figure 2 ) [2, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . The δ CoV, a new genus in the Coronaviridae family, usually infects birds, including HKU16, HKU17, and HKU21, or mammals, such as porcine deltacoronavirus HKU15 and new strains recently identified in United States, which causes porcine diarrhea [28, [31] [32] [33] [34] . Several α and β CoVs can infect humans, but only MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have led to regional or global human outbreaks [1, 2, 20, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Although MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are β CoVs, it is interesting to note that MERS-CoV is phylogenetically related to bat-CoVs HKU4 and HKU5 ( Figure 2 ) [2, [41] [42] [43] . Unlike HKU5, HKU4 can bind to bat and human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor of MERS-CoV, to directly infect bat cells, or indirectly infect a number of human cells by exogenous stimulation [8, 44, 45] . Two mutations, S746R and N762A, in the surface spike (S) protein may be responsible for transmitting MERS-CoV from bats to humans (Figure 1 ), thus explaining the origins of MERS-CoV in bats [7, 9, 44] . Similar to other CoVs, the MERS-CoV genome is a single positive-stranded RNA. It contains two large replicase open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding two proteases, a papain-like protease and 3C-like protease, which are conserved in all other CoVs [2, 43, 46] . The downstream ORF2, ORF6, ORF7, and ORF8 of MERS-CoV genome are believed to encode S, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins, respectively, all having different functions ( Figure 3A ,B) [2, 43] . MERS-CoV E protein, for example, promotes virulence [46, 47] . The surface S protein is composed of S1 and S2 subunits, respectively, responsible for cellular receptor DPP4 binding via the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and fusion of virus and cell membranes, thereby mediating the entry of MERS-CoV into target cells ( Figure 3C ) [45, [48] [49] [50] . The MERS-CoV RBD consists of a core structure, which is homologous to that of the SARS-CoV S protein RBD, and a receptor-binding motif, which is unique to MERS-CoV, thus determining viral pathogenesis and receptor recognition [51] [52] [53] [54] . In addition to the aforementioned major structural proteins, the MERS-CoV genome also encodes several accessory proteins, including 3, 4a, 4b, and 5, which, however, might not be essential for virus replication [27, 43, 47] . Recent studies have revealed that whole-genome consensus sequences of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels and humans are identical, further confirming MERS-CoV transmission from dromedary camels to humans [15, 55] . Since first emerging in Saudi Arabia in June 2012, cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection have been reported from 26 countries. Saudi Arabia has the largest number of MERS cases, followed by South Korea. As of February 02, 2016, 1,638 MERS cases, including 587 deaths (case fatality rate: ~36%), have been reported to the WHO [1] [2] [3] . Cases of MERS keep increasing in Saudi Arabia, and reach at 1,297 as of February 24, 2016 [4] . Similar to other coronaviruses (CoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5] and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV-CoV) [6] , MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus and originates from bats, suggesting that bats are the most likely natural reservoir of MERS-CoV [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, unlike SARS-CoV, which utilizes small animals, such as palm civets and raccoon dogs, as its intermediate hosts [11, 12] , MERS-CoV depends on dromedary camels [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Nevertheless, human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV does occur, and unprepared healthcare facilities could become a major source for human infection and transmission (Fig. 1) , as shown by the incidence of MERS-CoV cases in South Korea in 2015 [1, [18] [19] [20] [21] .

Although MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are β CoVs, it is interesting to note that MERS-CoV is phylogenetically related to bat-CoVs HKU4 and HKU5 (Fig. 2) [2, [41] [42] [43] . Unlike HKU5, HKU4 can bind to bat and human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor of MERS-CoV, to directly infect bat cells, or indirectly infect a number of human cells by exogenous stimulation [8, 44, 45] . Two mutations, S746R and N762A, in the surface spike (S) protein may be responsible for transmitting MERS-CoV from bats to humans ( Fig.  1) , thus explaining the origins of MERS-CoV in bats [7, 9, 44] . Similar to other CoVs, the MERS-CoV genome is a single positive-stranded RNA. It contains two large replicase open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding two proteases, a papain-like protease and 3C-like protease, which are conserved in all other CoVs [2, 43, 46] . The downstream ORF2, ORF6, ORF7, and ORF8 of MERS-CoV genome are believed to encode S, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins, respectively, all having different functions ( Fig. 3A -B) [2, 43] . MERS-CoV E protein, for example, promotes virulence [46, 47] . The surface S protein is composed of S1 and S2 subunits respectively responsible for cellular receptor DPP4 binding via the receptorbinding domain (RBD), and fusion of virus and cell membranes, thereby mediating the entry of MERS-CoV into target cells (Fig. 3C) [45, [48] [49] [50] . The MERS-CoV RBD consists of a core structure, which is homologous to that of the SARS-CoV S protein RBD, and a receptor-binding motif, which is unique to MERS-CoV, thus determining viral pathogenesis and receptor recognition [51] [52] [53] [54] . In addition to the aforementioned major structural proteins, the MERS-CoV genome also encodes several accessory proteins, including 3, 4a, 4b, and 5, which, however, might not be essential for virus replication [27, 43, 47] . Recent studies have revealed that whole-genome consensus sequences of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels and humans are identical, further confirming MERS-CoV transmission from dromedary camels to humans [15, 55] .@story_separate@MERS-CoV infection may trigger antigen-specific humoral immune responses and neutralizing antibodies in camels and humans [56] [57] [58] [59] . MERS-CoV-or S-specific antibodies, including those with neutralizing activity, were identified in dromedary camels from MERS-affected regions, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar and, the United Arab Emirates [13, 55, 56, 60] . In addition, the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies was shown to be significantly higher in individuals exposed to camels than that found among the general population [14] . Studies on 37 MERS-CoV-infected adult patients indicated that all survivals had serum IgG and neutralizing antibodies, and the levels of such antibodies were weakly but inversely correlated with viral loads in the lower respiratory tracts [61] . In South Korea, MERS-CoV-infected humans also demonstrated a clear kinetics of serologic responses, including robust antibody responses developed at the early stage of the disease onset, but delayed antibody responses with neutralizing activity associated with later, more severe stages of the disease [57] . The above studies suggest that humoral immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies, play an important role in preventing MERS-CoV infection. In addition to B-cell-mediated antibody responses, cellular immune responses mediated by specific T cells may play a supplementary role. The absence of IFNα in a patient who died from MERS-CoV infection could have impaired the production of antiviral adaptive IL-12-and IFN-γ-mediated Th1 immune responses, suggesting that IFNα might be important in the induction of robust cellular immune responses during the initial stage of disease progression [62] . Moreover, MERS-CoV infection may drive IL-17 production in humans, as well as the expression of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-12, IFNγ, IP-10, and RANTES, in dendritic cells [63] , effectively modulating innate immune responses. MERS vaccines can also induce humoral and cellular immune responses. Specifically, a good MERS vaccine should be able to induce strong humoral immune responses, particularly neutralizing antibodies, in vaccinated animals and humans, completely protecting immunized subjects from MERS-CoV challenge. Depending on the immunization routes, MERS vaccination may activate B cells to produce systemic IgG and/or secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies, both of which can bind to the virus and, respectively, mediate systemic and mucosal immune responses [64] [65] [66] . Serum IgA could also be induced upon vaccination, particularly through the mucosal or intranasal (i.n.) route [65] . Antibodies with neutralizing activity can then neutralize MERS-CoV infection by blocking virus-target cell binding via cellular receptor DPP4, thus inhibiting virus entry ( Figure 4) [67, 68] . It is likely that some B cells will become antigen-specific memory B cells capable of activation by further boost immunization or other stimulation factors to induce rapid recall antibody responses [69] , but this outcome has not been extensively studied in MERS-CoV-directed vaccines. Immunization of MERS vaccines could induce antigen-specific T-cell immune responses as well. As such, CD4 + T cells can be activated to secrete Th1, including IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNFα, and/or Th2, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10, cytokines, in turn promoting cytotoxic T cells, such as T lymphocytes or CD8 + T cells, to kill target cells infected with MERS-CoV ( Figure 4 ) [65, [70] [71] [72] . However, in animal models, neutralizing antibody alone was able to protect against challenge from MERS-CoV [64, 73] ; therefore, T-cell-mediated cellular immune responses, if needed, may play a supplementary role in preventing MERS-CoV infection [74, 75] . An ideal MERS vaccine candidate should have high immunogenicity and strong potency, as judged by the ability to induce potent immune responses and neutralizing antibodies, as well as complete protection against MERS-CoV infection, with the lowest dosage and least injection time through an appropriate route. In addition, MERS vaccines need to maintain good safety without inducing virus-enhancing antibody or harmful immune responses, or causing immunopathological effects [27, 75] . Current animal models for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of MERS vaccines MERS vaccines need to be evaluated in appropriate animal models before proceeding to human clinical trials. Substantial progress has been made in the development of MERS animal models, including non-human primates (NHPs), such as rhesus macaques and common marmosets [76] [77] [78] [79] , as well as small animal models, such as hDPP4-transduced and transgenic (Tg) mice [73, [80] [81] [82] [83] . Table 1 summarizes the currently available animal models, their characteristics, and potential applications for evaluating the efficacy of MERS vaccines. NHP models have been initially established as an effective vehicle for MERS-CoV infection and vaccine evaluation. Rhesus macaques infected with MERS-CoV developed lower respiratory tract symptoms with mild-to-moderate interstitial pneumonia, and virus replication mainly occurred in alveolar pneumocytes. Also, clinical signs of disease and neutralizing antibodies were produced in these animals upon virus infection [77, 78] . In contrast, marmosets, as a new MERS-CoV infection model, developed a much more severe disease with progressive severe pneumonia, leading to significant viral replication in the lungs and partial lethality [79] . However, other reports demonstrated a mild-to-moderate nonlethal respiratory disease in common marmosets with limited additional clinical signs upon inoculation with MERS-CoV [87] . Except for NHPs, camels infected with MERS-CoV may present upper respiratory tract symptoms with virus replication and shedding in the upper respiratory tract of inoculated dromedary camels [16] . Unlike SARS-CoV, which easily infects commonly used laboratory animals, including Syrian hamsters, ferrets, and mice [88] [89] [90] [91] , MERS-CoV does not normally infect these animal species because of the differences in binding viral receptor [92] [93] [94] [95] . Recently, a number of small animal models were developed for MERS-CoV [73, [80] [81] [82] [83] . For example, after prior transduction with adenovirus 5 expressing human DPP4 (Ad5-hDPP4), mice became sensitive to MERS-CoV infection and developed pneumonia accompanied by clinical disease and histopathological changes in the lungs [83] . In addition, a humanized (HuDPP4) mouse model was established, in which mouse DPP4 was replaced by human DPP4 [86] . In particular, a human DPP4 transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mouse model globally expresses the hDPP4 receptor, and it is fully permissive to MERS-CoV infection [73, 81] . Infected animals developed progressive pneumonia and demonstrated significant weight loss and death upon virus infection. Virus replication was detected in lung and brain [80] [81] [82] . Thus, such small animal models provide an economical, readily available method of testing the efficacy of MERS-CoV candidate vaccines. Immunization of MERS vaccines may activate naïve B cells to differentiate into plasma cells and produce serum IgG, IgA, and/or secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) antibodies to bind MERS-CoV. Antibodies with neutralizing activity will block binding between MERS-CoV and its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) at the cell surface, thus inhibiting virus entry into target cells. Naïve CD4+ and CD8 + T cells can also be activated to produce cytokines and/or function as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to destroy MERS-CoV-infected target cells. Some memory B (Bm) and T (Tm) cells may be activated after further stimulation or boost vaccination, and play a role in humoral and cellular immune responses. virus; viral vectors, including modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), adenovirus (Ad), and measles virus (MV); nanoparticles; DNA and DNA/protein; as well as subunit vaccines. Table 2 summarizes current MERS vaccines under development. Unlike SARS vaccines that are usually developed based on attenuated or inactivated SARS-CoV, thus having a potential to recover virulence [11, [105] [106] [107] [108] , MERS-CoV vaccines could be constructed based on recombinant viruses using reverse genetics. Accordingly, a recombinant MERS-CoV with expected marker mutations was generated using a panel of contiguous cDNAs spanning the entire viral genome and replicated to high titers with broad tissue tropism. Also, an engineered mutant MERS-CoV lacking the structural E protein was rescued and propagated in cells expressing the viral E protein in trans [46, 47] . Using reverse genetics, it is possible to develop a replication-competent, propagation-defective MERS-CoV candidate vaccine, providing a platform for the design of live attenuated MERS-CoV vaccines. Since such recombinant MERS viruses still contain major virus components, their safety needs to be tested extensively, and their immunogenicity requires further evaluation in appropriate animal models. Similar to viral vector-based SARS vaccines [109] [110] [111] , MERS vaccines can also be constructed using viral vectors that express major MERS-CoV proteins, normally the S protein. Several such MERS vaccine candidates have been developed and/or tested for efficacy in hDPP4-expressing mouse models or camels [64, 97, 100, 101] . Ad5 or Ad41 vector expressing full-length S or S1 protein of MERS-CoV-induced S-specific antibody responses and/or T-cell responses in a mouse model via the intramuscular (i.m.) or intragastric route, effectively neutralizing MERS-CoV infection in vitro [97, 102] . Also, i.m. or subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination of mice with a MVA-based full-length S vaccine elicited MERS-CoV-specific CD8 + T-cell response and neutralizing antibodies, protecting hDPP4-transduced mice against MERS-CoV challenge [100, 101] . Intranasally or intramuscularly administered MVA-S vaccine induced mucosal immunity, particularly the neutralizing antibodies, in dromedary camels, resulting in significant reduction of excreted infectious virus and viral RNA transcripts after MERS-CoV challenge [64] . Similarly, a recombinant MV-based MERS vaccine expressing full-length, or truncated, S protein of MERS-CoV induced robust MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses, protecting mice transduced with hDPP4 from MERS-CoV challenge [72] . Although able to elicit strong immune responses and/or protection, viral-vector-based vaccines might have some unwanted limitations in terms of safety and potency. For example, preexisting immunity to Ad in the general human population may cause some adverse effects by the induction of vaccine antigen-specific immune responses, thus reducing the overall efficacy of this vaccine type [112] [113] [114] . In addition, production of neutralizing antibodies against viral vectors themselves has been demonstrated in MV-S-and MVA-S- based MERS vaccines [64, 72] . Furthermore, full-length S protein of SARS-CoV encoded by the vectors can also induce nonneutralizing antibodies that may mediate enhancement of virus infection or cause harmful immune responses, such as inflammation and enhanced hepatitis [115] [116] [117] , special attention should be drawn when developing MERS-CoV full-length S protein-based viral vectored vaccines. Nanoparticles can be used as a delivery vehicle to develop MERS vaccines. Nanoparticles containing MERS-CoV full-length S protein can be prepared and purified from pellets of infected baculovirus insect cells. In the absence of adjuvants, these nanoparticles induced a lower level of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in mice, while in the presence of adjuvants, such as aluminum hydroxide (Alum) or Matrix M1, such neutralizing antibodies were significantly increased and maintained. Also, Matrix M1 significantly promoted the production of neutralizing antibodies as compared with Alum [96] . Thus, adjuvants are required for MERS nanoparticle vaccines, and different adjuvants function differently in promoting the immunogenicity of these vaccines. Thus far, efficacy and protection have not been evaluated for this vaccine type in MERS-CoV challenge models. Like the full-length S gene of SARS-CoV, DNA encoding fulllength S protein of MERS-CoV can also be utilized to develop MERS vaccines [70, 118] . Indeed, i.m./electroporation of mice and rhesus macaques with a synthetic DNA encoding fulllength S protein of MERS-CoV elicited potent virus-neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses, as represented by the secretion of INF-γ, TNF-α, and/or IL-2 cytokines in CD4 + and/or CD8 + T cells, as well as the production of neutralizing antibodies in immunized camels. In addition, immunized NHPs were protected against MERS-CoV challenge without demonstrating clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia [70] . Since such DNA vaccines encode MERS-CoV full-length S protein, the potential induction of virus-enhancing antibody and harmful immune responses is possible. In addition to a DNA-alone vaccination strategy, DNA priming followed by protein boosting could be used to develop MERS vaccines and, as a result, expand the immunogenicity and efficacy generated by DNA. In this combinational vaccination strategy, DNA was constructed to encode full-length S protein of MERS-CoV, while protein was expressed as the viral S1 subunit [84] . Results demonstrated that i.m./electroporation priming of full-length S DNA and i.m. boosting of S1 protein of MERS-CoV with Ribi or Alum (aluminum phosphate, AlPO 4 ) adjuvant in mice and rhesus macaques, respectively, induced robust neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV infection, conferring protection of NHPs against MERS-CoV-induced radiographic pneumonia. However, because of the containment of full-length S DNA in the vaccination regimen, the potential of vaccine-caused immunopathology needs to be investigated.  Protein-based subunit vaccines against MERS-CoV have been developed [66, 67, 71, 103] . While some subunit vaccines are designed on the basis of the full-length S1 protein [84] , the majority of them are based on viral RBD [66, 67, 71, 103, 119] . These RBD-based vaccines are evaluated for immunogenicity and protective immunity in a number of MERS-CoV animal models, including hDPP4-transduced and hDPP4-Tg mice, as well as NHPs [71, 73, 74, 103, 119, 120] . The antigenicity and functionality of these RBD proteins have also been extensively investigated. In general, subunit vaccines might not induce immune responses as strong as those induced by other vaccine types mentioned above. However, the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines could be significantly promoted in the presence of an ideal adjuvant via an appropriate route [65, 74] . In addition, it is also essential to maintain a suitable conformation of the protein antigen in the vaccine, such as the MERS-CoV RBD proteins [66, 67] . For example, both s.c. and i.n. immunization of MERS-CoV RBD protein adjuvanted with Montanide ISA51 or Poly(I:C) induced long-term, high titers of S-specific systemic IgG, IgA, and mucosal sIgA antibodies, potently neutralizing MERS-CoV infection [65] . After comparing several different RBD fragments of MERS-CoV S protein, a fragment containing residues 377-588 of RBD elicited the highest neutralizing antibody in mice and rabbits and was therefore identified as a critical neutralizing domain [66, 68] . Moreover, since MF59 adjuvant improved the ability of RBD protein to elicit the highest titer of neutralizing antibodies of all adjuvants tested, it is considered an ideal adjuvant to use with RBD subunit vaccines [74] . Even low doses of the RBD antigen plus MF59 adjuvant elicited sufficient neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV infection [104] . In the presence of MF59 adjuvant, this RBD protein protected Ad5-hDPP4-transduced and hDPP4-Tg mice from MERS-CoV challenge [73, 74] . Clearly, the identified critical neutralizing domain of MERS-CoV RBD protein maintained good conformational structure, strong antigenicity to bind specifically to MERS-CoV RBD-specific sera and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, as well as intact functionality to interact with soluble and cell-associated hDPP4 receptors [66, 68, 121] . In terms of safety consideration, subunit vaccines should be accounted as the safest vaccine type. They do not contain viral genetic materials, but only include essential antigens for eliciting protective immune responses, thus excluding the possibility of recovering virulence or inducing adverse reactions [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] . Different from the vaccines based on the full-length S or S1 protein, RBD-based MERS subunit vaccines contain the major neutralizing epitopes and lack non-neutralizing immunodominant domains, thus having minimum risk to induce non-neutralizing antibodies with potential to cause harmful immune responses or enhancement of virus infection [27, 66, 75] . Several MERS candidate vaccines in development have demonstrated the ability to induce immune responses and/or neutralizing antibodies that protect against MERS-CoV infection. Based on the limitations of some of these vaccine candidates, as discussed above, it might be fruitful to establish standards against which to measure the specific role of humoral and cellular immune responses relative to protection against MERS-CoV infection, and further evaluate the efficacy and correlation between immunogenicity and protection. In addition to efficacy, safety is an important issue for any MERS vaccine. Experience garnered from SARS vaccine studies has demonstrated that vaccines based on the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV may induce non-neutralizing antibodies with enhancing effect on virus infection or harmful immune responses, or cause immunopathological effect, such as inflammation and increased severity [115, 116] . Thus, when developing MERS vaccines based on the fulllength S protein, precautions should be taken against the induction of harmful immune responses and/or virus-enhancing antibodies potentially resulting from its non-neutralizing epitopes in the immunodominant domains. Concomitantly, the immunopathological effects of these MERS vaccines should be investigated. Other safety tests, such as toxicity experiments, are also recommended before moving a MERS vaccine candidate to human clinical trials or patient use. One may argue that no virus-enhancing antibody induced by full-length S protein of MERS-CoV has been reported so far. Indeed, there had been no report on antibody-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV infection for 8 years since the virus was first identified in Guangdong Province, China in 2003. However, Jaume et al. [117] reported in 2012 that a SARS vaccine based on the full-length S protein could induce in mice virus-neutralizing antibodies tested in Vero E6 cell culture, and virus-enhancing antibodies, via an FcγR-dependent manner, detected in cultures of THP-1, Raji, and Daudi cells that express FcγR. This finding suggests that virus-enhancing antibodies induced by the full-length S protein of MERS-CoV may be detectable if an appropriate assay system is used. Therefore, it would be especially important to investigate the potential of these MERS vaccines to induce virus-enhancing antibodies and harmful immune responses, and to cause immunopathological effects before moving a MERS vaccine candidate into human clinical trials. A lesson should be learned from the development of SARS vaccinesa shift from developing vaccines based on the full-length S protein at the beginning to developing RBD-based vaccines at the end. Different from the full-length S protein, RBD of MERS-CoV S protein contains a critical neutralizing domain and lacks immunodominant domains with non-neutralizing epitopes, thus is safe and highly immunogenic to induce potent neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against MERS-CoV infection. In comparison with other vaccine categories, such as recombinant viruses and viral vectored vaccines, subunit vaccines, including those based on the RBD, maintain higher safety profile due to the absence of viral genetic materials from the infectious viruses. The major conformational neutralizing epitopes in MERS-CoV RBD may attribute to RBD's ability to induce neutralizing antibodies against both wild-type and mutant viral strains, since a viral strain with mutations in one epitope may still be sensitive to the neutralizing antibodies induced by other epitopes in RBD [75, 84] , demonstrating RBD's capacity to elicit broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies and cross-protective immunity. Therefore, similar to RBD-based SARS vaccines [11, [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] , subunit vaccines based on MERS-CoV RBD have the greatest potential for further development as an effective and safe vaccine candidate. It is noted that in addition to RBD, other regions, such as N-terminal domain, in S1 fragment of MERS-CoV may also possess some neutralizing epitopes [119, 134] . Thus, combining RBD and S1 N-terminal domain in a subunit vaccine may result in synergistic effect in inducing broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies against divergent MERS-CoV strains. At present, two full-length MERS-CoV S candidate vaccines, one based on MVA and the other on DNA, have been scheduled for clinical trials [98, 99] . With the continual increase and extensive research of promising MERS vaccines in preclinical studies, more and more candidates with high efficacy and strong safety should be pushed forward to clinical trials for prevention of MERS-CoV infection. In the next 5 years, more robust, affordable small animal models should be developed to help evaluate the efficacy of MERS vaccines. Comprehensive studies on the efficacy and safety of MERS vaccines are expected. Since MERS-CoV RBDbased subunit vaccines induce strong immune responses and neutralizing antibodies and maintain the highest safety profile, such vaccines are expected to increase in number, and with investment from government and Big Pharma, it is further expected that such vaccines will be brought to clinical trials in an expeditious manner and, upon approval, be used for preventing MERS-CoV infection in humans and for building biodefense stockpiles. • Since its first identification in Saudi Arabia in 2012, MERS-CoV has infected at least 1638 persons worldwide, including 587 deaths, as of 2 February 2016, with Saudi Arabia and South Korea having the first and second largest MERS cases, respectively. • MERS-CoV uses bats and dromedary camels as the most likely natural reservoirs and intermediate transmission hosts. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. Therefore, as a newly added Category C Priority Pathogen, MERS-CoV poses a threat to public health and global safety, highlighting the importance of developing effective and safe MERS vaccines. • Among the four major structural proteins of MERS-CoV, S protein is the most important in viral pathogenesis. MERS-CoV depends on the S protein (S1 and S2 subunits) to bind the cellular receptor DPP4 through the RBD, followed by mediating MERS-CoV entry into target cells. As such, the viral S protein and RBD are major vaccine targets. • In addition to the major neutralizing epitopes in RBD, the full-length S protein also contains some immunodominant domains with non-neutralizing epitopes that can induce non-neutralizing antibodies, some of which may mediate enhancement of viral infection or harmful immune responses, or cause immunopathological effects, as those induced by the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV. • The RBD in the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV S protein contains major neutralizing epitopes and lacks immunodominant domains with non-neutralizing epitopes, thus having much less risk to induce virus-enhancing antibody or harmful immune responses and better potential than full-length S protein to be developed as an effective and safe MERS vaccine. This study was supported by the grant from the NIAID of the NIH (AI109094) and intramural funds from the New York Blood Center (NYB000348).

MERS-CoV infection may trigger antigen-specific humoral immune responses and neutralizing antibodies in camels and humans [56] [57] [58] [59] . MERS-CoV-or S-specific antibodies, including those with neutralizing activity, were identified in dromedary camels from MERS-affected regions, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates [13, 55, 56, 60] . In addition, the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies was shown to be significantly higher in individuals exposed to camels than that found among the general population [14] . Studies on 37 MERS-CoV-infected adult patients indicated that all survivals had serum IgG and neutralizing antibodies, and the levels of such antibodies were weakly but inversely correlated with viral loads in the lower respiratory tracts [61] . In South Korea, MERS-CoV-infected humans also demonstrated a clear kinetics of serologic responses, including robust antibody responses developed at the early stage of the disease onset, but delayed antibody responses with neutralizing activity associated with later, more severe stages of the disease [57] . The above studies suggest that humoral immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies, play an important role in preventing MERS-CoV infection. In addition to B cell-mediated antibody responses, cellular immune responses mediated by specific T cells may play a supplementary role. The absence of IFNα in a patient who died from MERS-CoV infection could have impaired the production of antiviral adaptive IL-12and IFN-γ-mediated Th1 immune responses, suggesting that IFNα might be important in the induction of robust cellular immune responses during the initial stage of disease progression [62] . Moreover, MERS-CoV infection may drive IL-17 production in humans, as well as the expression of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-12, IFN-γ, IP-10, and RANTES, in dendritic cells [63] , effectively modulating innate immune responses. MERS vaccines can also induce humoral and cellular immune responses. Specifically, a good MERS vaccine should be able to induce strong humoral immune responses, particularly neutralizing antibodies, in vaccinated animals and humans, completely protecting immunized subjects from MERS-CoV challenge. Depending on the immunization routes, MERS vaccination may activate B cells to produce systemic IgG and/or secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies, both of which can bind to the virus and, respectively, mediate systemic and mucosal immune responses [64] [65] [66] . Serum IgA could also be induced upon vaccination, particularly through the mucosal or intranasal (i.n.) route [65] . Antibodies with neutralizing activity can then neutralize MERS-CoV infection by blocking virus-target cell binding via cellular receptor DPP4, thus inhibiting virus entry (Fig. 4) [67, 68] . It is likely that some B cells will become antigen-specific memory B cells capable of activation by further boost immunization or other stimulation factors to induce rapid recall antibody responses [69] , but this outcome has not been extensively studied in MERS-CoV-directed vaccines. Immunization of MERS vaccines could induce antigen-specific T cell immune responses as well. As such, CD4+ T cells can be activated to secrete Th1, including IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNFα, and/or Th2, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10, cytokines, in turn promoting cytotoxic T cells, such as T lymphocytes or CD8+ T cells, to kill target cells infected with MERS-CoV ( Fig. 4) [65, [70] [71] [72] . However, in animal models, neutralizing antibody alone was able to protect against challenge from MERS-CoV [64, 73] ; therefore, T cell-mediated cellular immune responses, if needed, may play a supplementary role in preventing MERS-CoV infection [74, 75] . An ideal MERS vaccine candidate should have high immunogenicity and strong potency, as judged by the ability to induce potent immune responses and neutralizing antibodies, as well as complete protection against MERS-CoV infection, with the lowest dosage and least injection time through an appropriate route. In addition, MERS vaccines need to maintain good safety without inducing virus-enhancing antibody or harmful immune responses, or causing immunopathological effects [27, 75] . MERS vaccines need to be evaluated in appropriate animal models before proceeding to human clinical trials. Substantial progress has been made in the development of MERS animal models, including non-human primates (NHPs), such as rhesus macaques and common marmosets [76] [77] [78] [79] , as well as small animal models, such as hDPP4-transduced and transgenic (Tg) mice [73, [80] [81] [82] [83] . Table 1 summarizes the currently available animal models, their characteristics, and potential applications for evaluating the efficacy of MERS vaccines. NHP models have been initially established as an effective vehicle for MERS-CoV infection and vaccine evaluation. Rhesus macaques infected with MERS-CoV developed lower respiratory tract symptoms with mild-to-moderate interstitial pneumonia, and virus replication mainly occurred in alveolar pneumocytes. Also, clinical signs of disease and neutralizing antibodies were produced in these animals upon virus infection [77, 78] . In contrast, marmosets, as a new MERS-CoV infection model, developed a much more severe disease with progressive severe pneumonia, leading to significant viral replication in the lungs and partial lethality [79] . However, other reports demonstrated a mild-to-moderate nonlethal respiratory disease in common marmosets with limited additional clinical signs upon inoculation with MERS-CoV [87] . Except for NHPs, camels infected with MERS-CoV may present upper respiratory tract symptoms with virus replication and shedding in the upper respiratory tract of inoculated dromedary camels [16] . Unlike SARS-CoV, which easily infects commonly used laboratory animals, including Syrian hamsters, ferrets, and mice [88] [89] [90] [91] , MERS-CoV does not normally infect these animal species because of the differences in binding viral receptor [92] [93] [94] [95] . Recently, a number of small animal models were developed for MERS-CoV [73, [80] [81] [82] [83] . For example, after prior transduction with adenovirus 5 expressing human DPP4 (Ad5-hDPP4), mice became sensitive to MERS-CoV infection and developed pneumonia accompanied by clinical disease and histopathological changes in the lungs [83] . In addition, a humanized (HuDPP4) mouse model was established, in which mouse DPP4 was replaced by human DPP4 [86] . In particular, a human DPP4 transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mouse model globally expresses the hDPP4 receptor, and it is fully permissive to MERS-CoV infection [73, 81] . Infected animals developed progressive pneumonia and demonstrated significant weight loss and death upon virus infection. Virus replication was detected in lung and brain [80] [81] [82] . Thus, such small animal models provide an economical, readily available method of testing the efficacy of MERS-CoV candidate vaccines. No vaccines against MERS-CoV are currently available for human use. Nevertheless, progress has been made since the emergence of MERS-CoV in 2012, and a number of MERS vaccines have been developed and tested in preclinical stages [64, 66, 70, 72, 84, 96, 97] , two of which are scheduled for human clinical trials [98, 99] . These vaccines are based on recombinant virus; viral vectors, including modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), adenovirus (Ad), and measles virus (MV); nanoparticles; DNA and DNA/protein; as well as subunit vaccines. Table 2 summarizes current MERS vaccines under development. Unlike SARS vaccines that are usually developed based on attenuated or inactivated SARS-CoV, thus having a potential to recover virulence [11, [105] [106] [107] [108] , MERS-CoV vaccines could be constructed based on recombinant viruses using reverse genetics. Accordingly, a recombinant MERS-CoV with expected marker mutations was generated using a panel of contiguous cDNAs spanning the entire viral genome and replicated to high titers with broad tissue tropism. Also, an engineered mutant MERS-CoV lacking the structural E protein was rescued and propagated in cells expressing the viral E protein in trans [46, 47] . Using reverse genetics, it is possible to develop a replication-competent, propagation-defective MERS-CoV candidate vaccine, providing a platform for the design of live attenuated MERS-CoV vaccines. Since such recombinant MERS viruses still contain major virus components, their safety needs to be tested extensively, and their immunogenicity requires further evaluation in appropriate animal models. Similar to viral vector-based SARS vaccines [109] [110] [111] , MERS vaccines can also be constructed using viral vectors that express major MERS-CoV proteins, normally the S protein. Several such MERS vaccine candidates have been developed and/or tested for efficacy in hDPP4-expressing mouse models or camels [64, 97, 100, 101] . Ad5 or Ad41 vector expressing full-length S or S1 protein of MERS-CoV induced S-specific antibody responses and/or T-cell responses in a mouse model via the intramuscular (i.m.) or intragastric route, effectively neutralizing MERS-CoV infection in vitro [97, 102] . Also, i.m. or subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination of mice with a MVA-based full-length S vaccine elicited MERS-CoV-specific CD8+ T cell response and neutralizing antibodies, protecting hDPP4transduced mice against MERS-CoV challenge [100, 101] . Intranasally or intramuscularly administered MVA-S vaccine induced mucosal immunity, particularly the neutralizing antibodies, in dromedary camels, resulting in significant reduction of excreted infectious virus and viral RNA transcripts after MERS-CoV challenge [64] . Similarly, a recombinant MV-based MERS vaccine expressing full-length, or truncated, S protein of MERS-CoV induced robust MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses, protecting mice transduced with hDPP4 from MERS-CoV challenge [72] . Although able to elicit strong immune responses and/or protection, viral vector-based vaccines might have some unwanted limitations in terms of safety and potency. For example, pre-existing immunity to Ad in the general human population may cause some adverse effects by the induction of vaccine antigen-specific immune responses, thus reducing the overall efficacy of this vaccine type [112] [113] [114] . In addition, production of neutralizing antibodies against viral vectors themselves has been demonstrated in MV-S and MVA-Sbased MERS vaccines [64, 72] . Furthermore, full-length S protein of SARS-CoV encoded by the vectors can also induce non-neutralizing antibodies that may mediate enhancement of virus infection or cause harmful immune responses, such as inflammation and enhanced hepatitis [115] [116] [117] , special attention should be drawn when developing MERS-CoV fulllength S protein-based viral vectored vaccines. Nanoparticles can be used as a delivery vehicle to develop MERS vaccines. Nanoparticles containing MERS-CoV full-length S protein can be prepared and purified from pellets of infected baculovirus insect cells. In the absence of adjuvants, these nanoparticles induced a lower level of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in mice, while in the presence of adjuvants, such as aluminum hydroxide (Alum) or Matrix M1, such neutralizing antibodies were significantly increased and maintained. Also, Matrix M1 significantly promoted the production of neutralizing antibodies as compared with Alum [96] . Thus, adjuvants are required for MERS nanoparticle vaccines, and different adjuvants function differently in promoting the immunogenicity of these vaccines. Thus far, efficacy and protection have not been evaluated for this vaccine type in MERS-CoV challenge models. Like the full-length S gene of SARS-CoV, DNA encoding full-length S protein of MERS-CoV can also be utilized to develop MERS vaccines [70, 118] . Indeed, i.m./electroporation of mice and rhesus macaques with a synthetic DNA encoding full-length S protein of MERS-CoV elicited potent virus-neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses, as represented by the secretion of INF-γ, TNF-α, and/or IL-2 cytokines in CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells, as well as the production of neutralizing antibodies in immunized camels. In addition, immunized NHPs were protected against MERS-CoV challenge without demonstrating clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia [70] . Since such DNA vaccines encode MERS-CoV full-length S protein, the potential induction of virus-enhancing antibody and harmful immune responses is possible. In addition to a DNA-alone vaccination strategy, DNA priming followed by protein boosting could be used to develop MERS vaccines and, as a result, expand the immunogenicity and efficacy generated by DNA. In this combinational vaccination strategy, DNA was constructed to encode full-length S protein of MERS-CoV, while protein was expressed as the viral S1 subunit [84] . Results demonstrated that i.m./electroporation priming of fulllength S DNA and i.m. boosting of S1 protein of MERS-CoV with Ribi or Alum (aluminum phosphate, AlPO 4 ) adjuvant in mice and rhesus macaques, respectively, induced robust neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV infection, conferring protection of NHPs against MERS-CoV-induced radiographic pneumonia. However, because of the containment of fulllength S DNA in the vaccination regimen, the potential of vaccine-caused immunopathology needs to be investigated. Protein-based subunit vaccines against MERS-CoV have been developed [66, 67, 71, 103] . While some subunit vaccines are designed on the basis of the full-length S1 protein [84] , the majority of them are based on viral RBD [66, 67, 71, 103, 119] . These RBD-based vaccines are evaluated for immunogenicity and protective immunity in a number of MERS-CoV animal models, including hDPP4-transduced and hDPP4-Tg mice, as well as NHPs [71, 73, 74, 103, 119, 120] . The antigenicity and functionality of these RBD proteins have also been extensively investigated. In general, subunit vaccines might not induce immune responses as strong as those induced by other vaccine types mentioned above. However, the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines could be significantly promoted in the presence of an ideal adjuvant via an appropriate route [65, 74] . In addition, it is also essential to maintain a suitable conformation of the protein antigen in the vaccine, such as the MERS-CoV RBD proteins [66, 67] . For example, both s.c. and i.n. immunization of MERS-CoV RBD protein adjuvanted with Montanide ISA51 or Poly(I:C) induced long-term, high titers of S-specific systemic IgG, IgA, and mucosal sIgA antibodies, potently neutralizing MERS-CoV infection [65] . After comparing several different RBD fragments of MERS-CoV S protein, a fragment containing residues 377-588 of RBD elicited the highest neutralizing antibody in mice and rabbits and was therefore identified as a critical neutralizing domain [66, 68] . Moreover, since MF59 adjuvant improved the ability of RBD protein to elicit the highest titer of neutralizing antibodies of all adjuvants tested, it is considered an ideal adjuvant to use with RBD subunit vaccines [74] . Even low doses of the RBD antigen plus MF59 adjuvant elicited sufficient neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV infection [104] . In the presence of MF59 adjuvant, this RBD protein protected Ad5-hDPP4-transduced and hDPP4-Tg mice from MERS-CoV challenge [73, 74] . Clearly, the identified critical neutralizing domain of MERS-CoV RBD protein maintained good conformational structure, strong antigenicity to bind specifically to MERS-CoV RBD-specific sera and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, as well as intact functionality to interact with soluble and cell-associated hDPP4 receptors [66, 68, 121] . In terms of safety consideration, subunit vaccines should be accounted as the safest vaccine type. They do not contain viral genetic materials, but only include essential antigens for eliciting protective immune responses, thus excluding the possibility of recovering virulence or inducing adverse reactions [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] . Different from the vaccines based on the fulllength S or S1 protein, RBD-based MERS subunit vaccines contain the major neutralizing epitopes and lack non-neutralizing immunodominant domains, thus having minimum risk to induce non-neutralizing antibodies with potential to cause harmful immune responses or enhancement of virus infection [27, 66, 75] . Based on the limitations of some of these vaccine candidates, as discussed above, it might be fruitful to establish standards against which to measure the specific role of humoral and cellular immune responses relative to protection against MERS-CoV infection, and further evaluate the efficacy and correlation between immunogenicity and protection. In addition to efficacy, safety is an important issue for any MERS vaccine. Experience garnered from SARS vaccine studies has demonstrated that vaccines based on the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV may induce non-neutralizing antibodies with enhancing effect on virus infection or harmful immune responses, or cause immunopathological effect, such as inflammation and increased severity [115, 116] . Thus, when developing MERS vaccines based on the full-length S protein, precautions should be taken against the induction of harmful immune responses and/or virus-enhancing antibodies potentially resulting from its non-neutralizing epitopes in the immunodominant domains. Concomitantly, the immunopathological effects of these MERS vaccines should be investigated. Other safety tests, such as toxicity experiments, are also recommended before moving a MERS vaccine candidate to human clinical trials or patient use. One may argue that no virus-enhancing antibody induced by full-length S protein of MERS-CoV has been reported so far. Indeed, there had been no report on antibody-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV infection for 8 years since the virus was first identified in Guangdong Province, China in 2003. However, Jaume M et al [117] reported in 2012 that a SARS vaccine based on the full-length S protein could induce in mice virus-neutralizing antibodies tested in Vero E6 cell culture, and virus-enhancing antibodies, via an FcγRdependent manner, detected in cultures of THP-1, Raji, and Daudi cells that express FcγR. This finding suggests that virus-enhancing antibodies induced by the full-length S protein of MERS-CoV may be detectable if an appropriate assay system is used. Therefore, it would be especially important to investigate the potential of these MERS vaccines to induce virusenhancing antibodies and harmful immune responses, and to cause immunopathological effects before moving a MERS vaccine candidate into human clinical trials. A lesson should be learned from the development of SARS vaccines -a shift from developing vaccines based on the full-length S protein at the beginning to developing RBD-based vaccines at the end. Different from the full-length S protein, RBD of MERS-CoV S protein contains a critical neutralizing domain and lacks immunodominant domains with non-neutralizing epitopes, thus is safe and highly immunogenic to induce potent neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against MERS-CoV infection. In comparison with other vaccine categories, such as recombinant viruses and viral vectored vaccines, subunit vaccines, including those based on the RBD, maintain higher safety profile due to the absence of viral genetic materials from the infectious viruses. The major conformational neutralizing epitopes in MERS-CoV RBD may attribute to RBD's ability to induce neutralizing antibodies against both wildtype and mutant viral strains, since a viral strain with mutations in one epitope may still be sensitive to the neutralizing antibodies induced by other epitopes in RBD [75, 84] , demonstrating RBD's capacity to elicit broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies and cross-protective immunity. Therefore, similar to RBD-based SARS vaccines [11, [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] , subunit vaccines based on MERS-CoV RBD have the greatest potential for further development as an effective and safe vaccine candidate. It is noted that in addition to RBD, other regions, such as N-terminal domain, in S1 fragment of MERS-CoV may also possess some neutralizing epitopes [119, 134] . Thus, combining RBD and S1 N-terminal domain in a subunit vaccine may result in synergistic effect in inducing broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies against divergent MERS-CoV strains. At present, two full-length MERS-CoV S candidate vaccines, one based on MVA and the other on DNA, have been scheduled for clinical trials [98, 99] . With the continual increase and extensive research of promising MERS vaccines in preclinical studies, more and more candidates with high efficacy and strong safety should be pushed forward to clinical trials for prevention of MERS-CoV infection. In the next five years, more robust, affordable small animal models should be developed to help evaluate the efficacy of MERS vaccines. Comprehensive studies on the efficacy and safety of MERS vaccines are expected. Since MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines induce strong immune responses and neutralizing antibodies and maintain the highest safety profile, such vaccines are expected to increase in number, and with investment from government and Big Pharma, it is further expected that such vaccines will be brought to clinical trials in an expeditious manner and, upon approval, be used for preventing MERS-CoV infection in humans and for building biodefence stockpiles. • MERS-CoV uses bats and dromedary camels as the most likely natural reservoirs and intermediate transmission hosts. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. Therefore, as a newly added Category C Priority Pathogen, MERS-CoV poses a threat to public health and global safety, highlighting the importance of developing effective and safe MERS vaccines. • Among the four major structural proteins of MERS-CoV, spike (S) protein is the most important in viral pathogenesis. MERS-CoV depends on the S protein (S1 and S2 subunits) to bind the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), followed by mediating MERS-CoV entry into target cells. As such, the viral S protein and RBD are major vaccine targets. • Similar to MERS-CoV infection, MERS vaccines can trigger antigenspecific humoral, mucosal, and/or cellular immune responses. While cellular immune responses might be required to clear or kill virus, humoral immune responses, particularly neutralizing antibodies, play critical roles in protecting against MERS-CoV infection. • Several animal models, including small animal models expressing hDPP4 receptor, have been developed to evaluate the efficacy of MERS vaccines. • No MERS vaccines are available for human use. MERS vaccines under development are in preclinical stages, some of which are scheduled for human clinical trials. These vaccines are categorized as recombinant virus, viral vectors, nanoparticles, DNAs, DNAs/proteins, and subunit vaccines, the majority of which are based on the viral S protein. • In addition to the major neutralizing epitopes in RBD, the full-length S protein also contains some immunodominant domains with nonneutralizing epitopes that can induce non-neutralizing antibodies, some of which may mediate enhancement of viral infection or harmful immune responses, or cause immunopathological effects, as those induced by the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV. The RBD in the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV S protein contains major neutralizing epitopes and lacks immunodominant domains with nonneutralizing epitopes, thus having much less risk to induce virusenhancing antibody or harmful immune responses, and better potential than full-length S protein to be developed as an effective and safe MERS vaccine.@story_separate@MERS-CoV, a newly emerging infectious CoV and a new Category C Priority Pathogen, has caused high mortality in humans, thus posing continual threats to public health and global safety.

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease caused by a virus closely related to the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus. COVID-19 has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 (WHO 2020a). The COVID-19 pandemic has far-reaching consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself; it also has influence on quarantine measures, including political, cultural, and social implications. The WHO World Health Assembly made a global commitment to unite the world to fight COVID-19 (WHO 2020b) . The potential effects of COVID-19 have prompted extensive research to study the characteristics of the virus. Because the virus is new, it is challenging to predict when this disease will disappear. However, it has been found that about 60% of confirmed global COVID-19 cases have occurred in places with temperatures of 5°C-15°C. The pandemic spread to high latitudes in spring and summer, and countries located in mid-latitudes face the risk of a second wave of COVID-19 this autumn (Huang et al. 2020a ). Therefore, short-term prediction is critical to better manage the societal, economical, cultural, and public health consequences of the pandemic (Petropoulos and Makridakis 2020), especially in high-risk countries. Researchers worldwide have been predicting the development of the outbreak by using existing mathematical and statistical methods, including stochastic simulations, lognormal distribution (Linton et al. 2020) , machine learning, and artificial intelligence (Tuli et al. 2020 ). The SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed) and SIR (susceptible, infectious, and removed) infectious disease models are the most widely used (Wu, Leung, and Leung 2020; Wang et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020) . A global prediction system (Global Prediction System of the COVID-19 Pandemic; GPCP) based on the SIR model was recently developed (Huang et al. 2020b) . The system determines the parameters through historical data fitting, which allows it to make targeted predictions for various countries and obtain better prediction results. However, the development of the epidemic is complicated, and there are differences between the prediction results of the GPCP system model and the real data; thus, the results need further revision. Various methods have been used to revise prediction results. For example, the analoguedynamical approach is used to revise weather forecast models (Zheng et al. 2013; Yu et al. 2014) . To modify the model results, it is necessary to analyze and predict the difference between the predicted results and the true values (forecast residuals). The residuals fitted by the model to historical data are nonstationary and nonlinear. In this study, we used the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method, which is an adaptive and temporal local data analysis method (Wu et al. 2007; Wu and Huang 2009 ). EEMD is a time series analysis method based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method (Huang et al. 1998; Huang and Wu 2008) , which decomposes complicated data series into finite quasiperiodic components at different frequencies and is suitable for adaptive analysis of nonlinear and nonstationary time series. The EMD/EEMD method has been used to analyze nonlinear and nonstationary data in climatic and oceanic analyses (Wu et al. 2011; Ji et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2017 ) and for biomedical signal processing (Colominas, Schlotthauer, and Torres 2014) . Methods to predict time series include support vector machines (Wang, Qiu, and Li 2010) , artificial neural networks (Jiang et al. 2003) , and genetic programming (Koutroumanidis et al. 2009 ). Box and Jenkins introduced a time series analysis approach called the autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) method (Box and Jenkins 1976) , which combines the advantages of the autoregressive (AR) model and the moving-average (MA) model. The AR model quantifies the relationship between current data and previous data, and the MA model solves the problem of stochastically changing terms. The ARMA model has been applied to forecasting meteorological elements (Torres et al. 2005 ) and macroeconomic evolution (Anghelache, Grabara, and Manole 2016) . The model only needs time series data, so the residuals' prediction of the infectious disease model can be better applied in it. In this paper, we report upon work to improve the GPCP by applying the ARMA and EEMD methods to the results of the SIR model for the number of new cases in each country. We then use the method to predict the number of new cases in countries with fewer cases.@story_separate@We used the cumulative number of cases from the COVID-19 Data Repository published by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The number of new cases is the difference between the cumulative number of cases on the current day and the cumulative number of cases on the previous day. The fitting and prediction data are from the GPCP system, and temperature in the model was ignored. Based on the EMD method, the EEMD method has various improvements (Wu and Huang2009) . White noise is added to the original sequence, and the sequence is decomposed into a set of amplitude-frequency-modulated oscillatory components (intrinsic mode functions). These steps are repeated using a different white noise sequence each time, and the corresponding intrinsic mode functions are obtained as the final decomposition result. The detailed procedures can be found in previous studies (Huang et al. 1998; Huang and Wu 2008; Wu and Huang 2009 ). We first performed seven-point smoothing on the original residual sequence and EEMD decomposition on the smoothed sequence. The ratio of the additional noise to the standard deviation of the original sequence was set to 0.1 and repeated 100 times. For the p-order AR (p) model, the current value of the time series is expressed as follows (Box and Jenkins 1976; Wang et al. 2015) : For the q-order MA (q) model, q previous values expressed as random errors, and the current value of the time series is expressed as follows: From the above, the ARMA model is expressed as follows: where t y is the predictive value, i  is the correlation coefficient with each previous value, i  is the correlation coefficient with the previous white noise, t  is the white noise process with zero mean and variance, and ti   is the previous noise term. From the perspective of fitting the real data, the residuals of the model fitting and the real data are nonstationary and nonlinear time series. The EEMD method can extract signals from such sequences and decompose them into different oscillatory components. The GPCP system parameters are obtained by fitting real data, and the parameters in the GPCP system are fitted from the real situation, so the initial model prediction mainly represents the trend which depends on human factors such as government policies. Therefore, the residuals basically reflect the oscillation of the infectious disease and are suitable for the EEMD method. The ARMA method's prediction only depends on the time series, and no other information is needed. In addition, the increase in cases in countries with a small number of cases tends to show an increase in oscillation, a decrease in oscillation, or a stable oscillation within a certain range without obvious peaks, so the SIR model is not applicable. Owing to the advantages of the EEMD and ARMA methods, we propose a hybrid EEMD-ARMA method, which is motivated by the idea of ""decomposition and ensemble"" (Yu, Wang, and For countries with a small number of cases, after the original sequence of newly added cases is decomposed by EEMD, the components are not removed and the ARMA predictions are made for each component directly, yielding the prediction results. The relative error is calculated as r r ave(Result ) ave(Result ) Relative error= 100% ave(Result ) where ave(Result ) f is the average of the prediction for several days, and r ave(Result ) is the average of the real data for several days. Figure 2 shows the improvement of the prediction effect from 6 to 15 May 2020 by some countries using the hybrid EEMD-ARMA method to correct residuals. Judging from the relative error of the 10-day prediction before and after the revision, Italy is the one with the most obvious improvement. The relative error has improved from 83.23% to −10.22%. Netherlands has the best prediction effect after correction; the relative error before correction is 35.65%, and the relative error after correction is reduced to −0.07%. Using the GPCP system for direct prediction, only 15 of the 34 countries listed in Figure 2 have a relative error with an absolute value of less than 40%. After correction, the number of countries with an absolute value of less than 40% has increased to 24. This method offers great improvements for prediction, and has the potential to be effective for future predictions. corrections decreased by 32.44%, 3.46%, 73.01%, 23.55%, 35.58%, and 21.78%. Judging from the revised results, the relative error of the six countries has been reduced, and the new development trend is more in line with the real situation. Figure 4 shows the prediction results and relative errors of the new cases based on the EEMD-ARMA method for 10 days (6-15 May) in 6 countries. Some of these countries have a relatively small number of new cases (Sri Lanka), and the accuracy of the GPCP system prediction is low. Some countries are still in the stage of rapid increase in the number of new cases, and there has not been a peak (El Salvador, Kuwait, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Bolivia). The EEMD-ARMA method is used directly for prediction, and the relative error of the 10-day prediction in these 6 countries is less than 40%. This method performs well in El Salvador (−9.84%), Kuwait (−6.93%), South Africa (−0.09%), Sri Lanka (0.97%), and Bolivia (3.57%), where the fluctuation amplitude is small, and the prediction effect of Sudan (−38.21%), with a sudden increase in amplitude, is slightly worse. Overall, this method has better predicted the change range and trend of the new population in these countries. No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors. This work was jointly supported by the National Natural @story_separate@COVID-19 has spread rapidly and severely affects human health and economic development worldwide. Therefore, it is paramount to accurately predict the development of the epidemic in various countries to provide data for relevant organizations. Overall, the SIR model provides a good prediction, but it has some limitations. For example, there are errors in predictions for countries that enter a decline in new cases after the peak, and the predictions for countries that have not yet reached the peak are less accurate during the increase in cases. To improve our understanding of the global impact of COVID-19 and to better predict the number of COVID-19 cases in different countries, we developed a hybrid EEMD-ARMA method to correct the results of PGCP and make direct predictions for countries with small numbers of daily new cases. Our method provides more accurate and reliable predictions of the spread of COVID-19, and we hope the method will eventually inform strategic government responses. Based on our results, for cases that used the hybrid EEMD-ARMA method to make corrections and predictions, within 10 days of the back-prediction, the changes and trends in the number of new cases were closer to the actual situation. The relative errors were lower, and the prediction was better. Fighting the epidemic requires a concerted international effort, which we believe will eventually control the disease.","In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spreads rapidly around the world. To accurately predict the number of daily new cases in each country, Lanzhou University has established the Global Prediction System of the COVID-19 Pandemic (GPCP). In this article, the authors use the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) model and autoregressive–moving-average (ARMA) model to improve the prediction results of GPCP. In addition, the authors also conduct direct predictions for those countries with a small number of confirmed cases or are in the early stage of the disease, whose development trends of the pandemic do not fully comply with the law of infectious diseases and cannot be predicted by the GPCP model. Judging from the results, the absolute values of the relative errors of predictions in countries such as Cuba have been reduced significantly and their prediction trends are closer to the real situations through the method mentioned above to revise the prediction results out of GPCP. For countries such as El Salvador with a small number of cases, the absolute values of the relative errors of prediction become smaller. Therefore, this article concludes that this method is more effective for improving prediction results and direct prediction. 摘要 2020年, 新型冠状病毒肺炎(COVID-19)在世界范围内迅速传播.为准确预测各国每日新增发病人数, 兰州大学开发了COVID-19流行病全球预测系统(GPCP).在本文的研究中, 我们使用集合经验模态分解(EEMD)模型和自回归-移动平均(ARMA)模型对GPCP的预测结果进行改进, 并对发病人数较少或处于发病初期, 不完全符合传染病规律, GPCP模型无法预测的国家进行直接预测.从结果来看, 使用该方法修正预测结果, 古巴等国家预测误差均大幅下降, 且预测趋势更接近真实情况.对于萨尔瓦多等发病人数较少的国家直接进行预测, 相对误差较小, 预测结果较为准确.该方法对于改进预测结果和直接预测均较为有效."
"COVID -19 has significantly impacted our lives and has created an unprecedented scenario as people around the world are locked down, and businesses and governmentprivate institutions are closed. One of the sectors that has experienced the major impact is transportation. The majority of the countries have imposed restrictions on travelingi.e. both local and long-distance traveling, immediately following the outbreak of the virus in that country. This travel restriction has significantly affected people's mobility behavior. For example, around 52% reduction in activities has been observed in the transit stations of Canada during COVID -19 (i.e. mid-March to the end of April) compared to the pre-pandemic period (Google, 2020) . Much of the changes in travel demand has been attributed by individuals' adjustments in their daily travel activities such as replacing out-of-home activities with in-home activities. For instance, around 50% of Canadians are working from home due to COVID -19 (Leger, 2020) . There has been a surge in online shopping, avoiding travel for in-store purchases. In the case of long-distance travel such as international travel, people were required to adjust their travel plan primarily due to the closure of borders. However, little is known regarding individuals' immediate response in-terms of adjusting their travel activities; specifically, due to the unavailability of disaggregate-level data capturing individuals' travel activities immediate following the outbreak of such a pandemic. This paper discusses how individuals immediately responded to COVID -19 in Canada, upon the outbreak of the pandemic followed by the nation-wide travel restrictions and provincial state of emergencies imposed during the mid-March. Particularly, this paper focuses on individuals' engagement in daily and long-distance travel. Data for this study comes from a web-based survey known as the COVID -19 Survey for assessing Travel impact (COST) conducted from the last week of March to the first week of April. Data from the COST survey is utilized to analyze engagement in in-home activities, out-of-home travel activities, and long-distance travel of individuals residing in the Kelowna region of Canada.@story_separate@The COVID -19 Survey for assessing Travel impact (COST) is a web-based survey, which was deployed from March 24th to May 9th, 2020 to collect information regarding individuals' immediate response to the travel restriction during the pandemic. The survey collected data related to the daily activities, long distance travel, and sociodemographic information from respondents around the world. The daily activity component asked respondents about their out-of-home and in-home activities on the previous weekday. Information regarding the out-of-home activities include activity participation, travel mode, travel companion, and travel satisfaction, among others. In the case of the in-home activities, respondents provided information related to the frequency and duration of the activities. Then, respondents provided how their out-of-home and in-home activities were changed in-comparison to the prepandemic period. Similar out-of-home and in-home activity information were collected for a weekend day. For the long-distance travel component, respondents were asked to provide their planned and completed travel since January 2020. They provided information regarding the origin, destination, mode and purpose of their travel. They provided information on whether the travel was completed, cancelled, rescheduled, or unchanged. The socio-demographic component asked respondents about their gender, age, marital status, education, employment status, occupation, driving license ownership, household size, number of children, household income, and number of vehicles in the household. Following data collection, the cleaning and validation were performed for the segment of the data collected from the Kelowna region of British Columbia, Canada. The Kelowna region includes the City of Kelowna, West Kelowna, Vernon, Lake Country, and Peachland. The validation exercise is performed by comparing the data with the Canadian census. An iterative proportional fitting technique was adopted to validate the sample (Lomax & Norman, 2015) . The validated sample size is 202. The validation results suggest that the majority sample characteristics lies within a few percentage points from the census data. For example, female shows a share of 51.98% and 51.45% in the COST and census data respectively, which is a difference of around 0.50% only. In the case of marital status, the share of married individuals in the COST and census is 52.33% and 51.28% respectively, which is around 1% difference only. Among the household-level characteristics, the share of two-person household in COST and census is around 45.05% and 43.19%, which is a difference of less than 2%. Similarly, the COST sample over-represents renters by around 3% only. Therefore, it can be concluded that the COST sample reasonably represents the Kelowna population, which is considered for further analysis and discussion. This section presents analysis regarding individuals' daily activities including out-of-home activities and in-home activities, and long-distance travel immediately following the travel restrictions imposed in British Columbia, Canada. Daily activity analysis presented in this paper focuses on weekday activity only. Overall, individuals made around 1.62 trips/day/person during COVID -19 compared to around 3.33 trips/day/person in the pre-pandemic period, which is a drop by more than 50%. To better understand participation in different out-of-home activities, they were thematically aggregated into the following categories: work which includes work/school/work related errands, pick-up online order, recreation/social which includes recreation/visit family and friends/civic/religious activities, routine shopping, and household errands which includes personal business/household errands/pick up or drop off household members/health care/other activities. The frequency of daily activity participation during the COVID -19 pandemic is presented in Fig. 1 . The graph reports the average number of trips per person. On an average, the highest daily frequency of travel is found for routine shoppingi.e. around 0.5 trips/ Fig. 1. Frequency of activity participation during COVID -19. person/day. Individuals made around 0.4 trips/person/day for out-of-home work activities. In the case of recreational/social and pick-up online order activities, the frequency is around 0.28 and 0.23 trips/person/day respectively. The change in out-of-home activity analysis focuses on travel related to work, and recreation/social activities. Change refers to the adjustment made during COVID -19 compared the pre-COVID -19 period. In the case of work activities, distribution for the change is reported by occupation (Fig. 2) . The analysis reveals that work-related travel increased for some specific occupations such as health, education, law, community, government, and sales and services. Among the individuals reported an increase in their work travel, around 29% were associated with sales and services. Around 14% were health professionals. In the case of participation in recreation/social travel activities, distribution for the change is reported by age (Fig. 3) . Among the individuals who reported an increase in their recreation/social travel activities, a higher share of older adults increased their travel for participation in recreation/ social activities. For example, around 65% of the individuals with an increase in recreation/social activities were aged 60 years and above. Among the individuals who reported to stop traveling for recreation/social activities, younger adults were found to be predominant. For instance, the share of individuals aged below 35 years was around 42%. In the case of decrease in recreation/social activities, a higher share of middle-age individuals were found. In-home activities are thematically aggregated into: work and school, online shopping, leisure and discretionary, household and personal maintenance, and sleep and other. The duration of in-home activities by income group is presented in Fig. 4 . The analysis results suggest that higher proportion of higher income household worked at home for a longer duration. Specifically, the 75th percentile of the work/school activity duration for household income > 100,000 CAD was around 2.92 h. The average duration of mandatory in-home activity for this income group was around 2.10 h. Lower and middle income groups were more involved in leisure and discretionary activities, and sleep. For example, the average duration of leisure and discretionary activities for the income groups < 50,000 CAD, 50,000-100,000 CAD, and > 100,000 CAD were 1.46, 2.06, and 1.15 h respectively. The 75th percentile point of the leisure and discretionary activity duration for the middle income group of 50,000-100,000 CAD was around 3 h. For sleep activities, the average duration for the income groups 50,000-100,000 CAD and > 100,000 CAD were 3.67 and 2.81 h respectively. Fig. 3 . Change in travel for recreation/social activities during COVID -19 compared to the pre-pandemic. In the case of long-distance travel, around 42% individuals completed at least one long-distance travel since the January of 2020. Among the altered trips which includes cancelled, rescheduled, and unchanged travel, the majority were cancelled. Specifically, around 89% of the altered long-distance trips were cancelled. Further analysis is performed by thematically aggregating long-distance travel into: regional travel which is travel within the same province or state, domestic travel which is travel within the same country, and international travel which is travel across borders. Long distance travel is analyzed by travel mode and individuals' occupation (Fig. 5) . The right side (i.e. solid bars) of the graph represents percentage share distribution of occupation and travel mode for the completed trips. The left side (i.e. hatched bars) of the graph represents percentage share distribution of occupation and travel mode for altered trips. Overall, a higher share of the completed long-distance travel were regional. Specifically, around 55% of the completed trips were regional. For modal distribution, around 40% of the regional completed trips were performed using private car. Further analysis related to the occupation of the individuals reveals that around 27% of the regional completed car trips were performed by management professionals. The author would like to caution the interpretation related to the management occupation distribution, since the survey data over-represents this occupation group. In the case of altered long-distance travel, around 58% of the trips were international. Among the altered trips, international air travel were predominant, to be specific around 45%. Furthermore, around 17% of the altered international air travel were by management professionals. This is to certify that the author, Dr. Mahmudur Rahman Fatmi, has no conflict of interest to declare regarding the publication of the essay, titled ""COVID -19 Impact on Urban Mobility"".@story_separate@This study presents findings towards individuals' immediate response to COVID -19, in-terms of adjusting their travel activities. Specifically, this research presents individuals' adjustment in daily activities which includes out-of-home travel activities, in-home activities, and long-distance travel. Data for this study comes from the COVID -19 Survey for assessing Travel impact (COST). Data collected for the Kelowna region of British Columbia, Canada, are utilized in this study. The analysis suggests that individuals' out-ofhome activity participation is reduced by more than 50% during COVID -19. The highest daily frequency of travel is found for routine shopping, followed by work-related travel. A comparative analysis of adjustment in the out-of-home activities during COVID -19 and the pre-pandemic period suggests that work-related travel increased for some occupations such as health, education, law, community, government, and sales and services. For recreational/social travel activities, travel increased for a higher share of older adults. On the other hand, a higher share of younger adults were found to stop performing travel for recreational/social activities. In the case of in-home activities, higher income households were found to be predominant in tele-working for a longer duration. The average and 75th percentile duration of such mandatory activity for the income group > 100,000 CAD was around 2.92 and 2.10 h. Lower and middle income groups were more involved in leisure and discretionary activities, and sleep. For example, for leisure and discretionary activities, the average duration for the income groups < 50,000 CAD, 50,000-100,000 CAD, and > 100,000 CAD were 1.46, 2.06, and 1.15 h respectively. In the case of long-distance travel, the majority of the completed long-distance travel were made regionally using private car, which is around 40% of the completed trips. Among the altered (i.e. cancelled, rescheduled, and unchanged) long-distance trips, international air-travel were predominant, which was around 45% of the altered trips. In summary, the findings of this study provide important insights towards how people adjusted their daily out-of-home travel activity, in-home activity, and long-distance travel, which will assist in developing transportation plans and policies during and post COVID -19, as well as for future pandemic and any other unprecedented scenarios.","Abstract This paper presents individuals' adjustment in daily out-of-home travel activities, in-home activities, and long-distance travel during the COVID – 19 travel restrictions.

"Each year in the UK more than 70 000 older adults sustain a fragility fracture of the hip. 1 Strengths and limitations of this study ► A mixed-methodology approach will aid identification of hospital-level organisational factors which explain adverse patient outcomes following hip fracture, and which are amenable to improvement across the UK. ► This study is novel in terms of its scale and the unique datasets used, which gives a rare opportunity to robustly assess a complex system of care and the impacts this system has on patients with hip fracture and National Health Service (NHS) budgets. ► Use of quantitative, economic and qualitative analysis will provide a system-wide understanding of the hip fracture care pathway, which will inform development of an Implementation Toolkit, in partnership with key national stakeholders, to improve future service design. ► While multiple organisational datasets exist relevant to patient care in NHS hospitals, linking this NHS activity to comprehensive social care data is not viable, hence, social care sequalae following hip fracture admission does not form part of this protocol. ► Currently the NHS is experiencing unprecedented pressures; the REducing unwarranted variation in the Delivery of high qUality hip fraCture services in England and Wales study will determine the most efficient management pathways for high cost patients, to improve patient outcomes and free NHS resources for use elsewhere.@story_separate@Such fractures are indicative of osteoporosis. 1 Hip fractures are costly to patients, relatives and the National Health Service (NHS), with a significant impact on quality of life 2 ; a quarter of patients die within 1 year of hip fracture. 3 Research has shown annual NHS medical costs from hip fracture exceed £1.2 billion. 4 Patients sustaining hip fractures almost invariably require an operation, but patient care has many complexities requiring contributions from various healthcare professionals at different time-points during an oftenlengthy treatment journey. Many guidelines have been published trying to ensure all components of the care of patients sustaining hip fractures (hip fracture care) are provided consistently and to a high standard in all hospitals. 1 5-7 While care has improved for some, there remains a great deal of variation across the UK in how health services deliver hip fracture care, so treatment still depends on where and when patients present to hospital. This unwarranted variation in care includes delays waiting for an operation, the type of operation performed, how much specialist help is provided, how soon physiotherapy is delivered, how thoroughly bone health is assessed, and more. Substantial variation exists in how well patients recover after a hip fracture. Across the 172 hospitals currently providing hip fracture care in England and Wales, 1 month after hip fracture the proportion of patients who have died varies from 2% to 14% between hospitals, 8 and the proportion who have been able to return home ranges from 29% to 85%. 9 While overall 61% of patients are prescribed medication to reduce the chance of a further fracture in the future, this can vary enormously from 6% to 99.5% according to the hospital delivering hip fracture care. 10 Time spent in hospital is highly variable (the median length of stay in acute and postacute NHS care is 17 days, IQR 10-30 days) and the chance of being readmitted to hospital within 30 days because of a deterioration after discharge is high at 16%. 11 12 While patient outcomes are partly explained by patient-level risk factors (eg, age and comorbidity), it is hypothesised that organisational factors are responsible for variation in the delivery of fracture care pathways and hence patient outcomes; these organisational factors are potentially modifiable. It is important to understand how the set-up and organisation of healthcare services affects patient recovery and outcomes after hip fracture. These services can vary in many ways, for example, types and grade of clinical staff; capacity to perform prompt operations; access to suitable rehabilitation services. It is expected these factors will explain variation in quality of care, patient outcomes and associated health costs. Understanding these will enable us to inform changes in healthcare services to minimise avoidable variation in fracture care and improve the quality of care for all patients across the country. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on health service delivery across the NHS. 13 14 Hospitals have needed to rapidly adapt and reorganise services to continue to deliver hip fracture care. To assist in service planning, NHS England 15 16 and the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) 17 issued rapid guidance in March 2020 on the management of hip fracture patients during the coronavirus pandemic. [15] [16] [17] The limited evidence to date suggests that there has been wide variation in how hospitals have reconfigured services 18 19 and there is a lack of information about the impact of these changes on patient care. The aim of this mixed-methods study is to determine the components of hospital service delivery of hip fracture care that predict patient outcomes post hip fracture, and the direct health costs attributable to these organisational factors. Furthermore, to understand factors that act as barriers and facilitators to the delivery of hip fracture care, including strategies that hospitals used to adapt and innovate hip fracture care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using these results, and working with key stakeholders, a toolkit will be developed, suitable for use by hospital managers, clinical leads and healthcare system leads across the country, to improve organisational delivery of high-quality hip fracture services. Understanding strategies hospitals used to reconfigure care during the COVID-19 pandemic will inform development of more resilient services in the future. Data sources: organisational level Using a wide range of publicly available organisationallevel service data, available at a hospital/trust provider level in England and Wales, including eight national audits and nine data series/ratings resources (table 1), data will be extracted to characterise each component of the hip fracture care pathway from admission to discharge (figure 1). The derived organisational metrics will be linked using hospital provider codes. Time-specific organisational metrics will be linked to patients by using the year in which they were admitted with their hip fracture. Organisational metrics aim to quantify provision of emergency, orthopaedic, anaesthetic, orthogeriatric, nursing, physiotherapy, rehabilitation and governance services. Study population Data sources: patient-level Using routinely collected Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) Admitted Patient Care (APC) data, that includes admissions to all English hospitals within the NHS (ie, excluding privately financed healthcare), patients will be linked by NHS Digital, the national health and social care data provider, to Office for National Statistics (ONS) Civil Registrations (deaths) mortality data for the same period. Similarly, in Wales the NHS Wales Informatics Service will link patients with hip fractures in the Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW) to ONS mortality data. The resulting HES-ONS and PEDW-ONS patients' 22 ONS mortality data are obtained from death certificates of all registered deaths in England and Wales, 23 thus capturing deaths that occurred inside and outside of hospital. Each NHFD record includes information on patient demographics, anaesthetic risk grade, type of hip fracture and surgical operation performed. Hip fracture admissions will be identified using ICD-10 codes for fractured neck of femur (S72.0), pertrochanteric fracture (S72.1), subtrochanteric fracture (S72.2) and unspecified fracture of femur (S72.9). The study Open access population will consist of index cases of hip fracture (ie, the first occurrence of hip fracture), among English or Welsh residents (male and female) aged 60 years or more, admitted to an English or Welsh hospital between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2019. For each patient with an index hip fracture, all HES APC, outpatient clinic and emergency department (ED) attendance data in England, and similar PEDW data in Wales, will be analysed for the subsequent 12 months enabling post-fracture follow-up (thus the last follow-up will complete 31 March 2020 Health cost outcomes HES data reports Healthcare Resource Groups assigned to each finished consultant episode in a hospital spell via the Casemix Grouper Software (HRG4+). 24 HRGs are standard groups of clinically similar treatments that consume a common set of healthcare resources. HRGs will be valued using the most up-to-date prices available from Department of Health and Social care reference costs for NHS trusts, including a per diem costing for bed days in excess of those expected for a standard tariff. 25 Statistical analysis of outcomes Using a systematic approach, organisational factors will be identified which predict patient-level outcomes including associated health costs. Using a 'top-down' approach, defining a priori indicator groupings (domains), informed by NHFD BPT variables with stakeholder consensus, key indicators will be identified predicting patient outcomes. Clinicians will undertake expert panel review to select potential explanatory organisational-level variables. The flow diagram (figure 2) illustrates this review process which will be repeated across all organisational data sources. Further expert-driven data reduction will involve examining the prevalence and correlation of selected organisational variables with each outcome, to finalise the dataset for multi-level models. Those variables selected for inclusion will be mapped to one or more domains of hip fracture care (eg, admission, anaesthesia, delirium prevention, governance, annual hospital admissions for hip fracture, inpatient falls, nutrition, orthogeriatrician assessment, pain management, rehabilitation, surgery, therapy provision and ward staffing and care (see figure 3 ). Each organisational variable will be assigned as relevant to one or more patient outcomes. Multi-level regression modelling will identify organisational components of the hip fracture care pathway responsible for the greatest variation in patient outcomes and costs. The hierarchical data structure consists of patients (level 1), nested within hospitals (level 2). Multilevel regression models will describe the association of organisational-level factors on patient-level outcomes, while adjusting for patient case-mix, and allow assessment of interactions between patient-level and organisationallevel factors. Case-mix adjustment will be the same as that used in the NHFD clinical audit 26 and will include age, sex, residence prior to admission, pre-fracture mobility, fracture type and American Society of Anaesthesiologists grade 27 (figure 3). Further adjustment will explore inclusion of the following additional patient-level variables as part of the case-mix adjustment: area-level deprivation, quantified by the Index of Multiple Deprivation 28 ; Figure 2 Flow diagram used to determine organisational data metrics. *Include if two or more of the four reviewers categorised variable as 'include' or 'possible', otherwise exclude; any lack of consensus resolved by a third reviewer (the principal investigator). Shaded boxes indicate variables which will be included in analyses. Open access comorbidity, quantified by the Charlson comorbidity index 29 and frailty, quantified by the hospital frailty risk score. 30 Having identified the proportion of variance in a given patient-level outcome, not explained by patient-level factors (ie, case-mix), the between-hospital variability explained by fixed organisational effects will be quantified, that is, the proportion of between-hospital variance explained by the configuration of specific services. For each outcome, domains added sequentially to a multilevel model (after case-mix adjustment) will be fitted to identify those domains which have the greatest effect and predict patient-level outcomes. From the selected domains the most influential organisational variables will be identified. Patient costs will be adjusted for baseline costs (ie, the healthcare costs incurred in the year prior to hip fracture) and patient case-mix as detailed earlier. Adjusted estimates of patient costs will be reported as aggregate costs and costs disaggregated by initial hospital superspell and readmissions/further NHS care. Different pathways of care following hip fracture will be identified by expert consensus agreement for comparative cost analyses. The multi-level model will be used to determine how health costs relate to organisational factors and patient outcomes, identifying organisational factors associated with highest/lowest costs. Cost profiles will be calculated for different hip fracture care pathway models, facilitating budget impact analyses (eg, estimate potential NHS savings should hip fracture care pathway models change). Costed scenarios will inform the Implementation Toolkit cost-benefit calculator. For the qualitative interviews four hospitals will be selected and approached. For English hospitals, BPT (2017-2019) and Key Performance Indicators (2018) will be collated, and 25 hospitals with the most and 25 with the least variable scores selected. 31 Hospitals will be excluded if (i) they are major trauma centres (as these hospitals may differ significantly from the majority of hip fracture hospitals which are not major trauma centres); (ii) they have recently merged or moved location; (iii) Open access they are participating in the hip fracture quality improvement programme (as practices in these hospitals are likely to be changing); (iv) they are located local to the study team (eg, Bristol, Bath) (to avert any conflict of interest within the research team); (v) if data quality is poor (as measured by NHFD report 1 ) ; (vi) or if the hospital manages low volumes of hip fractures (annual hip fracture admissions less than the fifth percentile). From the remaining pool, hospitals will be selected to provide a diverse range in terms of 30-day mortality trend (2017-2018), BPT trend (2017-2019), hospital size (large/medium) and geographical location (eg, city/ rural/coastal, north/south of England). A qualitative interview study will characterise the organisation of hip fracture services and identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of key components of fracture care. In addition, strategies that hospitals used to adapt and innovate hip fracture care delivery, during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with barriers and facilitators to the reorganisation of services in 2020 will be ascertained. Four hospitals have been identified that encompass variation in a range of characteristics as listed above, aiming to identify varied service configurations. 32 Studying care in these settings will enable us to capture the experiences of those delivering different models of hospital care. At the four participating hospitals, 1:1 in-depth interviews will be conducted with stakeholders involved in the organisation and delivery of hip fracture services, including orthogeriatricians, orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetists, emergency medicine physicians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, trauma nurses and discharge and service managers. Interviews will be carried out either remotely or in person (according to infection control constraints) with informed consent, including consent to audio-recording. An estimated 10-15 professionals will be interviewed at each hospital site, totalling around 40-60 professionals across the study. However, final sample size will be determined when data saturation is achieved; that is, when no new themes or subthemes are identified in the data. 33 Interviews will be conducted using a topic guide with a list of themes and subthemes to guide discussions. This will enable us to compare and contrast stakeholder views and provide flexibility to pursue emerging ideas. 34 To understand contextual factors that impact on service implementation, study design and analysis will be informed by Implementation Science. Implementation Science comprises theories or frameworks that have been used to help understand factors that help or hinder the delivery of complex interventions such as hip fracture care. [35] [36] [37] [38] The topic guide has been devised by the study team with Patient and Public Involvement (PPI). PPI identified patient priorities during the first wave of COVID-19, which will enable exploration of how services adapted to meet these needs. Four to six pilot interviews will inform topic guide refinement. If refinements are minor, initial pilot interviews will contribute to the main analysis. Interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed and anonymised. Transcripts will be imported into NVivo qualitative software and analysed using an inductive thematic analysis to identify key themes and subthemes in the data. 39 Following this, an abductive approach will be used whereby themes/subthemes will be transposed onto concepts from Implementation Science theory. 40 To ensure rigour, 20% of transcripts will be independently analysed in duplicate and themes reviewed and refined to agree a themes list. To complement the qualitative interviews and to understand the common themes and solutions ('lessons learnt') in relation to provision of hip fracture care, qualitative content analysis will be conducted of anonymised detailed hospital-initiated peer-review process (PRP) reports from 22 hospitals (all that have been conducted by the BOA to 2019). PRP reports, produced by the BOA over the period 2013-2019, were delivered when UK hospital service leads requested a BOA 'peer-review' to improve their hip fracture service. Each PRP report includes interviews with a range of staff (eg, clinical directors, clinicians, nurses, therapists, anaesthetists, ED personnel and managers). PRP reports are structured encompassing appraisal of the full hip fracture care pathway: ED, orthopaedics, anaesthetics, theatre activity, orthogeriatrics, nursing, therapies, discharge planning, collection of NHFD audit data and governance structures. Reports list all areas of good practice and highlight issues where improvements are achievable. PRP reports include a series of recommendations made by the multi-disciplinary assessment team with numerated action points. Reports will be imported into NVivo qualitative analysis software and will be analysed thematically to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of quality hip fracture services. 39 Themes identified in the documentary analysis will be mapped onto those from the qualitative interviews. To illustrate this process, data will be displayed on charts using the framework approach to data organisation. 41 Written accounts will then be generated. Recommendations will inform choice of domains in quantitative analyses and of subsequent Implementation Toolkit development. In 2015 the Royal (formerly National) Osteoporosis Society (ROS), developed a Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) Toolkit to aid FLS commissioning of new or improved services. 42 It was designed to support business case development, saving time for service leads and commissioners, and has been highly successful. Since 2015 the Service Improvement Team at the ROS have supported the development of 34 new FLSs. These new services cover a patient population of more than 12 million people and it has been estimated that 5 years following implementation of all these services, approximately 3854 hip fractures will have been prevented. Approximately 60% of the UK population can access an FLS, and the ROS is currently Open access working with sites all over the UK to ensure that current services are delivering in line with national clinical guidelines, and supporting sites that do not have an FLS at present. The ROS has acquired extensive experience in service improvement, refining tools based on user feedback, and continuing to support quality improvement. Working with the ROS, the BOA and other stakeholders, a Hip Fracture Implementation Toolkit will be codeveloped, focusing on inpatient hip fracture services, prioritising organisational factors identified from our quantitative and qualitative results which contribute to poor and/or highly variable patient outcomes post hip fracture. All acute NHS hospitals currently have a hip fracture care pathway; hence, the toolkit will include a step-by-step guide to improve and implement changes to current services. It will be made available online and provide a series of instructions and guides (ie, 'tools') for managers, clinical leads and healthcare system leads to use to improve their hospital hip fracture services, encompassing service redesign/restructuring, organisational cultural change, and approaches to improve efficient use of limited healthcare resources. Tools will include a service improvement guide, business case resources, a cost calculator and a project plan. This study has been developed in collaboration with the University of Bristol Musculoskeletal Research Unit (MRU) PPI group comprising members who have had/ are having treatment for osteoporosis and/or fractures, who meet (currently virtually) every 3 months to input into the design and conduct of MRU research projects. They have guided development of the project proposal, informing prioritisation of research questions, drafting plain English text, changing language and wording within study texts; they have informed methods adaptation in response to COVID-19 in 2020. The group will provide ongoing support throughout the study, addressing (i) key patient and carer questions and priorities, (ii) the interpretation and relevance of results and (iii) communication of findings. 'Taking the research' to patients in the involvement group rather than asking patients to attend research management meetings has improved engagement and fosters strong collaboration and respect. 43 Meetings will be organised by an experienced PPI coordinator (KW), who will facilitate meetings, provide ongoing support and tailored development to patient members, and advise on good practice.  Findings will be disseminated through scientific conferences, peer-reviewed publications and online implementation workshops. Results will be fed back to the scientific committee with oversight of the NHFD as well as the BOA. Reports will be provided to each hospital in England and Wales summarising findings, and the PPI group will be involved in all stages of dissemination. Working with the ROS, dissemination materials will be developed for its membership network (n=20 000). The Implementation Toolkit will be hosted and made freely available by the ROS website. In conclusion, a system-wide understanding of sources of variation in hip fracture care delivery and the effects on patient outcomes will inform service-level interventions to reduce unwarranted variation, maximise health equity and ultimately improve patient experience. The study aims to show effective hip fracture care is more efficient, realising cost-savings in hospital bed-days potentially re-directable to other services. This project is novel in terms of its scale and the unique datasets which gives us a rare opportunity to robustly assess what is a complex system of care and the very real impacts this system has on patients. Findings will inform future commissioning/ service planning priorities for hip fracture care, inform national review processes for hip fracture services and, together with a new online toolkit, this programme aims to minimise avoidable variation in hip fracture care and improve the quality of care for patients across the UK. peer-review reports, and qualitative interviews with staff from four diverse UK hospitals providing hip fracture care, will identify barriers and facilitators to care delivery. The Covid-19 pandemic has posed a major challenge to the resilience of services and interviews will explore strategies used to adapt and innovate. This system-wide understanding will inform development, in partnership with key national stakeholders, of an 'Implementation Toolkit' to inform and improve commissioning and delivery of hip fracture services.

Research has shown annual NHS medical costs from hip fracture exceed £1.2billion 4 . Patient sustaining hip fractures almost invariably require an operation, but patient care has many complexities requiring contributions from many healthcare professionals at different time-points during an often-lengthy treatment journey. Many guidelines have been published trying to ensure all components of the care of patients sustaining hip fractures (hip fracture care) are provided consistently and to a high standard in all hospitals 1 5-7 . Whilst care has improved for some, there remains a great deal of variation across the UK in how health services deliver hip fracture care, so treatment still depends upon where and when patients present to hospital. This unwarranted variation in care includes delays waiting for an operation, the type of operation performed, how much specialist help is provided, how soon physiotherapy is delivered, how thoroughly bone health is assessed, and more. Substantial variation exists in how well patients recover after a hip fracture. Across the 173 hospitals currently providing hip fracture care in England and Wales, one month after hip fracture the proportion of patients who have died varies from 2% to 14% between hospitals 8 , and the proportion who have been able to return home ranges from 29% to 85% 9 . Whilst overall 61% of patients are prescribed medication to reduce the chance of a further fracture in the future, this can vary enormously from 6% to 99.5% according to the hospital delivering hip fracture care 10 . Time spent in hospital is highly variable (the median length of stay in acute and post-acute NHS care is 17 days, interquartile range 10-30 days) and the chance of being readmitted to hospital within 30-days because of a deterioration after discharge is high at 16% 11 12 . Whilst patient outcomes are partly explained by patient-level risk factors (e.g. age and comorbidity), it is hypothesised that organisational factors are responsible for variation in the delivery of fracture care pathways and hence patient outcomes; these organisational factors are potentially modifiable. It is important to understand how the set-up and organisation of healthcare services affects patient recovery and outcomes after hip fracture. These services can vary in many ways, e.g. types and grade of clinical staff; capacity to perform prompt operations; access to suitable rehabilitation services. It is expected these factors will explain variation in quality of care, patient outcomes, and associated health costs. Understanding these will enable us to inform changes in healthcare services The 2020 Covid-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on health service delivery across the NHS 13 14 . Hospitals have needed to rapidly adapt and reorganise services to continue to deliver hip fracture care. To assist in service planning, NHS England 15 16 and the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) 17 issued rapid guidance in March 2020 on the management of hip fracture patients during the coronavirus pandemic 15 16 17 . The limited evidence to date suggests that there has been wide variation in how hospitals have reconfigured services 18 19 and there is a lack of information about the impact of these changes on patient care.  Quantitative study Using a wide range of publicly available organisational-level service data, available at a hospital/trust provider level in England and Wales, including 8 national audits and 9 data series/ ratings resources (Table 1 ), data will be extracted to characterise each component of the hip fracture care pathway from admission to discharge ( Figure 1 ). The derived organisational metrics will be linked using hospital provider codes. Time-specific organisational metrics will be linked to patients by using the year in which they were admitted with their hip fracture. Organisational metrics aim to quantify provision of emergency, orthopaedic, anaesthetic, orthogeriatric, nursing, physiotherapy, rehabilitation and governance services. Hip fracture admissions will be identified using ICD-10 codes for fractured neck of femur (S72.0), pertrochanteric fracture (S72.1), subtrochanteric fracture (S72.2) and unspecified fracture of femur (S72.9). The study population will consist of index cases of hip fracture (i.e. the first occurrence of hip fracture), among English or Welsh residents (male and female) aged 60 years or more, admitted to an English or Welsh hospital between 1st April 2016 and 31st March 2019. For each patient with an index hip fracture, all HES APC, outpatient clinic and emergency department (ED) attendance data in England, and similar PEDW data in Wales, will be analysed for the subsequent 12 months enabling post-fracture follow-up (thus the last follow-up will complete 31st March 2020 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 25 . Using a systematic approach, organisational factors will be identified which predict patient-level outcomes including associated health costs. Using a 'top-down' approach, defining a priori indicator groupings (domains), informed by NHFD BPT variables with stakeholder consensus, key indicators will be identified predicting patient outcomes. Clinicians will undertake expert panel review to select potential explanatory organisational-level variables. The flow diagram ( Figure 2 ) illustrates this review process which will be repeated across all 17 organisational data sources. Further expert-driven data reduction will involve examining the prevalence and correlation of selected organisational variables with each outcome, to finalise the dataset for multi-level models. Those variables selected for inclusion will be mapped to one or more domains of hip fracture care (e.g. admission, anaesthesia, delirium prevention, governance, annual hospital admissions for hip fracture, inpatient falls, nutrition, orthogeriatrician assessment, pain management, rehabilitation, surgery, therapy provision and ward staffing & care (see Figure 3) ). Each organisational variable will be assigned as relevant to one or more patient outcomes. Multi-level regression modelling will identify organisational components of the hip fracture care pathway responsible for the greatest variation in patient outcomes and costs. The hierarchical data structure consists of patients (level 1), nested within hospitals (level 2). Multilevel regression models will describe the association of organisational-level factors on patient-level outcomes, whilst adjusting for patient case-mix, and allow assessment of interactions between patient-level and organisational-level factors. Case-mix adjustment will be the same as that used in the NHFD clinical (Figure 3 ). Further adjustment will explore inclusion of the following additional patient-level variables as part of the case-mix adjustment: arealevel deprivation, quantified by the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 28 ; comorbidity, quantified by the Charlson comorbidity index 29 ; and frailty, quantified by the hospital frailty risk score 30 . Having identified the proportion of variance in a given patient-level outcome, not explained by patient-level factors (i.e. case-mix), the between-hospital variability explained by fixed organisational effects will be quantified, i.e. the proportion of between-hospital variance explained by the configuration of specific services. For each outcome, domains added sequentially to a multi-level model (after case-mix adjustment) will be fitted to identify those domains which have the greatest effect and predict patient-level outcomes. From the selected domains the most influential organisational variables will be identified. Patient costs will be adjusted for baseline costs (i.e. the health care costs incurred in the year prior to hip fracture) and patient case-mix as detailed above. Adjusted estimates of patient costs will be reported as aggregate costs and costs disaggregated by initial hospital superspell and readmissions/ further NHS care. Different pathways of care following hip fracture will be identified by expert consensus agreement for comparative cost analyses. The multi-level model will be used to determine how health costs relate to organisational factors and patient outcomes, identifying organisational factors associated with highest/lowest costs. Cost profiles will be calculated for different hip fracture care pathway models, facilitating budget impact analyses (e.g. estimate potential NHS savings should hip fracture care pathway models change). Costed scenarios will inform the implementation toolkit cost-benefit calculator. For the qualitative interviews four hospitals will be selected and approached. For English hospitals, BPT (2017-9) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (2018) will be collated, and 25 hospitals with the most and 25 with the least variable scores selected 31 . Hospitals will be excluded if (i) they are major trauma centres (as these hospitals may differ significantly from the majority of hip fracture hospitals which are not major trauma centres); (ii) they have recently merged or moved location; (iii) they are participating in the hip fracture quality improvement programme (HipQIP) (as practices in these hospitals are likely to be changing); (iv) they are located local to the study team (e.g. Bristol, Bath) (to avert any conflict of interest within the research team); (v) if data quality is poor (as measured by A qualitative interview study will characterise the organisation of hip fracture services and identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of key components of fracture care. In addition, strategies that hospitals used to adapt and innovate hip fracture care delivery, during the Covid-19 pandemic, along with barriers and facilitators to the reorganisation of services in 2020 will be ascertained. Four hospitals have been identified that encompass variation in a range of characteristics as listed above, aiming to identify varied service configurations 32 . Studying care in these settings will enable us to capture the experiences of those delivering different models of hospital care. At the four participating hospitals, 1:1 in-depth interviews will be conducted with stakeholders involved in the organisation and delivery of hip fracture services, including orthogeriatricians, orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetists, emergency medicine physicians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, trauma nurses and discharge and service managers. Interviews will be carried out either remotely or in person (according to infection control constraints) with informed consent, including consent to audio-recording. An estimated 10 -15 professionals will be interviewed at each hospital site, totalling around 40 -60 professionals across the study. However, final sample size will be determined when data saturation is achieved; that is when no new themes or subthemes are identified in the data 33 . Interviews will be conducted using a topic guide with a list of themes and subthemes to guide discussions. This will enable us to compare and contrast stakeholder views and provide flexibility to pursue emerging ideas 34 . To understand contextual factors that impact on service implementation, study design and analysis will be informed by Implementation Science. Implementation Science comprises theories or frameworks that have been used to help understand factors that help or hinder the delivery of complex interventions such as hip fracture care [35] [36] [37] [38] . The topic guide has been devised by the study team with Patient and Public Involvement (PPI). PPI identified patient priorities during the first wave of Covid-19, which will enable exploration of how services adapted to meet these needs. Four to six pilot interviews will inform topic guide refinement. If refinements are minor, initial pilot interviews will contribute to the main analysis. Interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed and anonymised. Transcripts will be imported into NVivo qualitative software and analysed using an inductive thematic analysis to identify key themes and subthemes in the data 39 . Following this, an abductive approach will be used whereby themes/ subthemes will be transposed onto concepts from Implementation Science theory 40 . To ensure rigor, 20% of transcripts will be independently analysed in duplicate and themes reviewed and refined to agree a themes list. To complement the qualitative interviews and to understand the common themes and solutions (""lessons learnt"") in relation to provision of hip fracture care, qualitative content analysis will be conducted of anonymised detailed hospital-initiated peer-review process ( Reports will be imported into NVivo qualitative analysis software and will be analysed thematically to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of quality hip fracture services 39 . Themes identified in the documentary analysis will be mapped onto those from the qualitative interviews. To illustrate this process, data will be displayed on charts using the framework approach to data organisation 41 . Written accounts will then be generated. Recommendations will inform choice of domains in quantitative analyses and of subsequent implementation toolkit development. an FLS at present. The ROS has acquired extensive experience in service improvement, refining tools based on user feedback, and continuing to support quality improvement. Working with the ROS, the BOA and other stakeholders, a Hip Fracture Implementation Toolkit will be co-developed, focusing on inpatient hip fracture services, prioritising organisational factors identified from our quantitative and qualitative results which contribute to poor and/or highly variable patient outcomes post hip fracture. All acute NHS hospitals currently have a hip fracture care pathway; hence the toolkit will include a step-by-step guide to improve and implement changes to current services. It will be made available online and provide a series of instructions and guides (i.e. 'tools') for managers, clinical leads and healthcare system leads to use to improve their hospital hip fracture services, encompassing service redesign/ restructuring, organisational cultural change, and approaches to improve efficient use of limited healthcare resources. Tools will include a service improvement guide, business case resources, a cost calculator and a project plan. This study has been developed in collaboration with the University of Bristol Musculoskeletal Research Unit (MRU) PPI group comprising members who have had/are having treatment for osteoporosis and/or fractures, who meet (currently virtually) every 3 months to input into the design and conduct of MRU research projects. They have guided development of the project proposal, informing prioritisation of research questions, drafting plain English text, changing language and wording within study texts; they have informed methods adaptation in response to Covid-19 in 2020. The group will provide ongoing support throughout the study, addressing (i) key patient and carer questions and priorities, (ii) the interpretation and relevance of results, and (iii) communication of findings. 'Taking the research' to patients in the involvement group rather than asking patients to attend research management meetings has improved engagement and fosters strong collaboration and respect 43 . Meetings will be organised by an experienced PPI coordinator (KW), who will facilitate meetings, provide ongoing support and tailored development to patient members, and advise on good practice.  Findings will be disseminated through scientific conferences, peer-reviewed publications and online implementation workshops. Results will be fed back to the scientific committee with oversight of the NHFD as well as the BOA. Reports specific will be provided to each hospital in England and Wales summarising findings, and the PPI group will be involved in all stages of dissemination. Working with the ROS, dissemination materials will be developed for its membership network (n=20,000). The Implementation Toolkit will be hosted and made freely available by the ROS website.

HES data reports Healthcare Resource Groups assigned to each finished consultant episode (FCE) in a hospital spell via the Casemix Grouper Software (HRG4+) 41 . HRGs are standard groups of clinically similar treatments that consume a common set of healthcare resources. HRGs will be valued using the most up-to-date prices available from Department of Health and Social care reference costs for NHS trusts, including a per diem costing for bed days in excess of those expected for a standard tariff 42 .

Quantitative analyses will allow us to distinguish patient outcomes explained by the health of the patient themselves, versus outcomes attributable to the hospital services which they encounter. Domains of hip fracture care which are most critical for a wide range of patient outcomes over 12 months, will be identified. The direct health costs ascribed to each patient in the year after hip fracture, accounting for costs in the year prior to fracture, will be calculated. Thus, hospital expenditure attributable to different components of hip fracture service delivery will be calculated. These financial calculations will inform cost calculators in the Implementation Toolkit.

Patients’ outcomes are partly explained by patient-level risk factors, but it is hypothesised that organisational-level factors account for the persistence of unwarranted variation in outcomes. The mixed-methods REducing unwarranted variation in the Delivery of high qUality hip fraCture services in England and Wales (REDUCE) study, aims to determine key organisational factors to target to improve patient care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Quantitative analysis will assess the outcomes of patients treated at 172 hospitals in England and Wales (2016–2019) using National Hip Fracture Database data combined with English Hospital Episodes Statistics; Patient Episode Database for Wales; Civil Registration (deaths) and multiple organisational-level audits to characterise each service provider. Statistical analyses will identify which organisational factors explain variation in patient outcomes, and typify care pathways with high-quality consistent patient outcomes. Documentary analysis of 20 anonymised British Orthopaedic Association hospital-initiated peer-review reports, and qualitative interviews with staff from four diverse UK hospitals providing hip fracture care, will identify barriers and facilitators to care delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a major challenge to the resilience of services and interviews will explore strategies used to adapt and innovate. This system-wide understanding will inform the development, in partnership with key national stakeholders, of an ‘Implementation Toolkit’ to inform and improve commissioning and delivery of hip fracture services. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved: quantitative study by London, City and East Research Ethics Committee (20/LO/0101); and qualitative study by Faculty of Health Sciences University of Bristol Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 108284), National Health Service (NHS) Health Research Authority (20/HRA/71) and each NHS Trust provided Research and Development approval. Findings will be disseminated through scientific conferences, peer-reviewed journals and online workshops."
"Exclusive breastfeeding, defined as infants receiving breastmilk only for the first 6 months of life, is the undisputed optimal infant nutrition choice for its extensive short-and long-term health benefits (World Health Organization [WHO] , 2020). Literature supports a dose-response relationship between breastfeeding and infant mortality, whereby infants partially or not breastfed have a significant 6-fold increase in mortality compared with those exclusively breastfed (Sankar et al., 2015) . Programs such as the Baby-Friendly Initiative have helped improve Canadian breastfeeding rates, with approximately 90% of mothers breastfeeding at birth and 57% of infants exclusively breastfeeding for 6 months (Public Health Agency of Canada [PHAC] , 2019). However, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) rank lowest in the country, with a 70% breastfeeding initiation rate and a 16% exclusivity rate at 6 months (Perinatal Program Newfoundland Labrador [PPNL], 2014; PHAC, 2019) . Nationally, geographical area of residence does not present a significant difference in breastfeeding statistics; however, limited studies understanding barriers to breastfeeding in rural contexts exist (Lukeman et al., 2019; PHAC, 2019) . In contrast with urban communities, NL's unique geography presents a widely rural and dispersed population having strong traditional roots and reliance on community supports (Bonia et al., 2013; Roberton et al., 2020) . The COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat to breastfeeding rates through increased social isolation, health resource diversion, and heightened maternal stress (Lebel et al., 2020; Roberton et al., 2020; Yoshikawa et al., 2020) . This commentary will emphasize the need to ensure breastfeeding rates do not decline in NL as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.@story_separate@A woman's decision on how she will feed her infant and commit to her choice is influenced by societal and cultural norms, family and peer encouragement, and effective clinical support (PHAC, 2019). A societal stigma of embarrassment and sexualization associated with breastfeeding has contributed to NL's low breastfeeding rates and consequently has normalized bottle-feeding (Bonia et al., 2013; Vieth et al., 2016) . These beliefs have also resulted in a perception of inconvenience, as women express the need to seek privacy to feed their infant (Bonia et al., 2013) . Baby-Friendly NL initiated a poster campaign, distributing breastfeeding images in public spaces across NL to normalize breastfeeding in society. Surveys conducted in two rural community shopping centres in NL revealed that the campaign provided significant improvement (p < 0.05) in perceived acceptability of public breastfeeding in specific settings among those who had seen the posters. However, discomfort with public breastfeeding in NL persists (Vieth et al., 2016) . The decision to breastfeed is often made during pregnancy (PHAC, 2019). Women often look to their mothers during decision-making around infant feeding, and their mothers' personal experiences and deep-rooted traditions further encourage the societal norm of bottle-feeding in NL (Bonia et al., 2013) . A theme specific to mothers from rural communities of NL was that a younger childbearing age influenced their lack of interest in discussing breastfeeding with their primary care provider and, consequently, their decision to formula feed (Bonia et al., 2013) . For mothers who decide to breastfeed, the support available can profoundly influence breastfeeding duration and continuation (PHAC, 2019). Mobilization of health supports in rural settings has numerous barriers, often not accounted for in urban-designed health services (Lukeman et al., 2019) . Access to specialized services, such as a lactation consultant, is often centralized to regional hospitals. Mothers within rural regions may not have peer support in their communities. The geographical community dispersion in NL rural areas can create long commutes for mothers and their infants, increasing reliance on public health nurses and community organizations for breastfeeding support in rural communities (Bonia et al., 2013; PPNL, 2014) . Concern regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission in breastmilk has been at the forefront of conversation for maternal and infant health. WHO (2020) reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not transmitted through breastmilk, and encouraged global support in initiation and continuation of breastfeeding among mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. To ensure timely breastfeeding initiation, the Canadian Pediatric Society, PHAC, and WHO recommend mothers and newborns not be separated at birth, even in COVID-19-positive cases, and emphasize hospital policies' importance in supporting the practice (Breastfeeding Committee for Canada, 2020). However, the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic can affect breastfeeding rates (Roberton et al., 2020; Yoshikawa et al., 2020) . Increased stress and social isolation during the pandemic may contribute to breastfeeding cessation when challenges are faced, especially when routine clinical and peer supports are not in place (Lebel et al., 2020) . Additionally, early introduction of infant formula feeding can lead to an increased financial burden on individuals and the health care system (Taylor et al., 2020) . Breastfeeding, unfortunately, is not always an easy process. National surveys identified 'not enough milk' and 'difficulty with breastfeeding technique' as the most prevalent concerns among Canadian women that lead to breastfeeding cessation (PHAC, 2019). These experiences reflect the importance of accessible support in navigating breastfeeding challenges. Social isolation from peers and group settings, as experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic, decreases conversations around breastfeeding and opportunities to normalize the practice (WHO, 2020). Not only will this impact breastfeeding initiation rates, but also continuation rates as women lack breastfeeding peer-support. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in changes in health care provider supports and services during the perinatal period as public health nurses are diverted to pandemic response efforts. The interruption of health care services and inperson support may increase breastfeeding cessation, thereby increasing risk of adverse health impacts for mothers and infants (Lebel et al., 2020; Roberton et al., 2020; Sankar et al., 2015; Yoshikawa et al., 2020) . Researchers have predicted that a 5% reduction in health care providers' availability, service accessibility, and resource allocation for maternal and newborn health during the pandemic response can equate to an approximately 8-10% increase in maternal and infant mortality (Roberton et al., 2020; Yoshikawa et al., 2020) . Many rural and remote communities have limited numbers of health care providers. While breastfeeding support is a fraction of the perinatal services provided, these conservative statistics underline the impact of resource diversion away from perinatal health. Conversely, the mothers facing breastfeeding challenges may be less willing to seek health providers' assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic (Roberton et al., 2020) . Breastfeeding concerns may be self-perceived as an unimportant health need, in addition to the perceived risk of contracting the virus by visiting health centres (Lebel et al., 2020; Roberton et al., 2020) . The economic impact of COVID-19 has created additional stress on families of NL. In acknowledging the national economic crisis predicted to follow the public health emergency of COVID-19, former Premier Dwight Ball emphasized the uniqueness of NL's economy and its reliance on resources such as tourism, fishery, and oil and gas; all of which have been adversely impacted in 2020 (Antle, 2020) . Families affected by lay-offs and income loss are subject to food insecurity, impacting those who have decided to formula feed. Furthermore, infant malnutrition risk will increase as families face the financial burden of formula feeding and rural regions experience limited formula inventory from a potentially depleted supply chain (Breastfeeding Committee for Canada, 2020; Roberton et al., 2020) . Policymakers must support breastfeeding in rural communities during COVID-19 through continued perinatal services in order to, at a minimum, maintain existing initiation and exclusivity rates (Breastfeeding Committee for Canada, 2020; Roberton et al., 2020; WHO, 2020; Yoshikawa et al., 2020) . Given that decisions for infant feeding often occur in the prenatal period, frequent, informative conversations around breastfeeding before childbirth can positively influence decision-making (PHAC, 2019). WHO (2018) recommends that breastfeeding counselling occur a minimum of six times during the pre-and post-natal period, ideally through face-toface conversations. In navigating care delivery during pandemic restrictions, interventions must be innovative yet appropriate. While online platforms create an opportunity for improved health support services, they also have the potential to further exacerbate inequities in rural and remote communities that lack high-speed internet connectivity. Furthermore, personal privacy concerns arise with internet-based video communication to provide real-time breastfeeding assistance and education. Roberton et al. (2020) advocate for routine public health services when possible during the global pandemic. The isolation of rural communities provides an advantage in its ability to control and trace rates of COVID-19. When permitted by public health officials, small-sized breastfeeding support groups should be encouraged. Health care providers have a strong influence on a woman's decision to breastfeed when a supportive relationship is established, especially among young mothers in rural communities (Bonia et al., 2013; PHAC, 2019) . Postpartum nurses within regional birthing centres have a unique opportunity to assist in navigating early and anticipated breastfeeding challenges before community discharge. Continued support for evidence-based tools in clinical settings, such as the Baby-Friendly Initiative, is necessary to optimize policies and practice that promote breastfeeding in the immediate postpartum period (WHO, 2018) . A knowledge gap exists in the literature regarding influencing factors for breastfeeding rates specific to NL rural communities. Similarly, a recent study in Nova Scotia investigating factors affecting Baby-Friendly Initiative uptake has recommended future research into breastfeeding barriers specific to rural districts (Lukeman et al., 2019) . Data collection on breastfeeding rates and influencing factors during the COVID-19 pandemic is required to understand the potential health burden and necessary supports in rural settings in the future.@story_separate@Best practice guidelines indicate breastfeeding protection, promotion, and support are essential in humanitarian emergencies, such as global pandemic (WHO, 2018) . Societal norms and health support strongly influence breastfeeding for infant nutrition in NL (Bonia et al., 2013; Vieth et al., 2016) . The COVID-19 pandemic creates barriers to positive influences of breastfeeding, particularly in rural communities, and further risks a decline in maternal and infant health in NL. It is critical that health providers and policymakers optimize opportunities to provide physical breastfeeding support in hospital and community settings moving forward (Lebel et al., 2020; WHO, 2018; Yoshikawa et al., 2020) .","Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life has become the global standard of infant feeding for its extensive benefits to maternal and infant health. Public health programs, such as the Baby-Friendly Initiative, have helped increase the national breastfeeding initiation rate to 90%. However, initiation rates in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) continue to rank the lowest in the country at 70%, with a 6-month exclusivity rate of 16%. This commentary will discuss the influence of geographical location, societal norms, and accessibility to health care services on breastfeeding in rural and remote NL communities. While the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself does not impact the mother’s ability to breastfeed, the indirect impacts of COVID-19 on health care services, social isolation, and economic burden challenge breastfeeding initiation and continuation. Priority solutions will draw on capacity building by emphasizing relationships within the community to deliver innovative and appropriate support programs. Continued education with health practitioners and further research into breastfeeding barriers in rural communities is critical moving forward."
"Many studies since the 1960s have researched the topic of the cyclical sensitivity of the unemployment rate. In the beginning, this literature paid attention to the common component, which is dominant in explaining movements in regional unemployment rates (Martin 1997) . The idea to link the regional to the national unemployment rate and to estimate this relationship for each individual region dates back to Thirlwall (1966) and Brechling (1967) , in what is known as the regional cyclical sensitivity literature. Recently, Vega and Elhorst (2016) bring the cyclical sensitivity literature back to the analysis of regional disparities by considering in their methodology serial dynamics, spatial dependence and common factors. Traditionally, dynamic panel data models only accounts for spatial dependence (also called weak spatial dependence) which is an observed correlation across space because of local interactions between regions generating spillover effects. This new model also allows to account for common factors (also known as strong spatial dependence) that is an observed correlation across space as a result of shared factors such a aggregated economic fluctuations, where outcomes change together as these factors change. This modeling opens a new line of interest for analyzing unemployment among regions considering the presence of common factor and ensuring, that way, unbiased results. Briefly, the literature on regional unemployment disparities identifies four stylized facts that defines regional unemployment disparities: (1) regional unemployment rates are strongly correlated over time, (2) regional unemployment rate behaves in parallel to the national unemployment rate, (3) are correlated across space and (4) display heterogeneity among regions. Focusing on Spain, there are large differences in the unemployment rate among regions (Bande et al. 2008; Cuéllar-Martín et al. 2019 ) becoming more persistent over time, and bigger after the last economic crisis (Jimeno and Bentolila 1998; Albulescu and Tiwari 2018) . So that, it is necessary to pay attention to these differences and address them in terms of cyclical sensitivity. Thus, analyzing regional unemployment rate disparities, the dependence between different regions and the relation to the national rate simultaneously is a requirement to implement appropriate policies. The last economic recession in Spain after 2009, reinforced this need, so that many studies had focused on analyzing the regional disparity in unemployment rates since that economic crisis. Nowadays, this necessity reappears due to the dramatic effects produced in the Spanish economy and its labor market because of the COVID-19 pandemic (McKibbin and Fernando 2020) . In this line, one of the articles that has focused on the analysis of the reactions of regional unemployment to changes in the economic cycle for Spain is Bande et al. (2008) . This paper concludes that there is a positive relationship between the regional dispersion of unemployment and the economic cycle, which guarantees that fluctuations in the economic situation of the country directly affect to regional unemployment. Since that study, many papers have focused on analyzing the reason for these disparities, assuming that unemployment is sensitive to the economic cycle. For example, a group of papers make the analysis of regional cyclical sensibility based on dividing regions with high and low unemployment (Bande and Karanassou 2009; Sala and Trivín 2014) . Other block of researches focuses on doing spatial analyses of unemployment disparities to find clusters of similar behaviors (Cuéllar-Martín et al. 2019) . Finally, some papers have focused on looking for regional characteristics that motivate regional differences (López-Bazo and Motellón 2013; Melguizo 2017) . However, none of the articles have analyzed trends of regional unemployment while simultaneously considering that regional unemployment rates are persistent, heterogeneous, parallel to the national rate and spatially dependent. According to Vega and Elhorst (2016) , isolated analysis can potentially lead to biased results, since series dynamics, spatial dependence and common factors are more likely to be interdependent. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to simultaneously analyze, for the Spanish case, the persistence, heterogeneity, spatial dependence and heterogeneity in economic cycle sensitivity of regional unemployment. The main objective of this work is to provide new evidence about how Spanish regions react to economic fluctuations as a requirement to implement appropriate policies. The economic and labor implication due to public and private containment measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, such as school, shops and factory closures, travel restrictions and quarantines, with the corresponding cut in domestic demand, (Baldwin and Tomiura 2020) make this knowledge to be crucial. As a result, heterogeneous behaviors will reveal the necessity to introduce regional perspectives against future economic fluctuations. Our paper contribute to the literature as follow. As the main contribution, we use Vega and Elhorst (2016) methodology to simultaneously consider all components of the stylized fact that defines the disparities in regional unemployment rates. Another contribution is that we show evidence that sensitivity has a geographic pattern since we find that the regions located on the Mediterranean coast are the most sensitive and that as we go inland and northwest, this sensitivity decreases. This pattern reveals, moreover, that regions with higher unemployment rates are not the most sensitive. Our results are in line with the new side of the literature indicating that the regional-specific unemployment rate is not important at all in the unemployment trend but that geographical factors do matter (Cuéllar-Martín et al. 2019) . In this vein, Camacho et al. (2018) also find a geographical pattern in the propagation of economic crisis and the way the unemployment rate reacts to recessions.@story_separate@The data used in this work, extracted from de la Fuente (2019), 1 are the annual unemployment rates for the 15 autonomous communities of Spain from 1978 to 2018 and the annual Spanish unemployment rate, treated as a common factor following Bailey et al. (2016) . 2 Regional unemployment rates tend to have some specific characteristics. In particular, many works have found that regional unemployment is characterized by being correlated in time, in space and with the national rate. Figure 1 shows the evolution over time of regional unemployment rates for the 15 autonomous communities of Spain analyzed together with the national rate. This figure shows how, in general, the regional and national unemployment rates have a similar trend throughout the analyzed period. Some special situations can be observed where, despite behaving similarly to the national rate, the regional rate is always higher than the national unemployment rate, as in the case in Andalucia or Extremadura. On the other hand, La Rioja and Navarra always seem to stay below the national rate. In addition, this unemployment rate is relatively stable over time, except in different periods of economic growth and downturns. Specifically, three major economic crises can be distinguished in Spain (Cancelo 2004; Gadea et al. 2012; Camacho et al. 2018) : the first in 1983-1985, the second in 1991-1994 and the third and most recent in 2008-2014. Several conclusions can be drawn by observing Fig. 1 . First, all crises seem to have a strong national component, since regional rates fluctuate similarly to the national rate. Second, there is clear heterogeneity in the trends To analyze the spatial distribution of unemployment rates and to determine the possible correlation in space, Fig. 2 maps unemployment rates over the period analyzed every eight years (1978, 1986, 1994, 2002, 2010 and 2018) . A clear north/ south contrast that has been accentuated in recent years, in addition, shows a pattern of spatial correlation, where neighboring regions have similar rates. To test that space matters in our case study, we have estimated global spatial autocorrelation through the Moran's I statistic from 1978 to 2018. The results of these tests show that, for most of the years, the null hypothesis (absence of global spatial autocorrelation) is rejected. 34 Our methodological strategy involves the application of the recently developed model by Vega and Elhorst (2016) , which simultaneously accounts for serial dynamics, spatial dependence and common factors; their study also shows how not simultaneously including these effects for the regional unemployment rate can produce biased results. We use the CD test (Pesaran 2004 ) in its local version (Moscone and Tosetti 2009, eq.22) to test for the presence of cross-sectional dependence in our panel data. If the null hypothesis is rejected, we can corroborate the existence of cross-sectional dependence. This test is carried out by specifying the relationship matrix of the 15 Spanish regions (W). The result of this test applied to the data shows the presence of cross-sectional dependence in regional unemployment rates (Z = 29.987 with p value = 0.000). This outcome is highly statistically significant, indicating that crosssectional dependence needs to be accounted for. For this purpose, we have used a row-normalized binary contiguity matrix, which is an NxN matrix describing the arrangement of the regions in space, with 1 if two regions are neighbors and 0 if not. We use this alternative based on the empirical results explained in Vega and Elhorst (2014) and Elhorst (2017) where they find that this specification outperforms the other alternatives. We tried first and second order binary contiguity matrix. However, second order binary contiguity seems not to reflect well the relations between the Spanish regions since having 15 regions the average number of links in each region is 8.667. This result implies that, for example, Andalusia, a region located in the far south of Spain, would have spillovers with Aragon located in the far north of Spain. On the other hand, to determine if the nature of this spatial dependence is weak or strong (in other words, if it is due or not to the presence of common factors), we apply the -test exponent of Bailey et al. (2016) . 5 This test can take values between 0 and 1, where values below 0.5 indicate the presence of weak spatial dependence and values equal to 1 indicate the presence of strong spatial dependence. The result of this test applied to the data gives = 1.003 6 and std. err. = 0.034 which points to the presence of strong spatial dependence, common factors needs to be accounted for. Our target model is the one proposed by Vega and Elhorst (2016) that reads as follows: where U t is a column vector with one observation of the dependent variable (unemployment) for every unit (i) at every point at time (t). U t−1 , WU t and WU t−1 are vectors of temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal lags, respectively, with , and autoregressive coefficients. W is the row-normalized binary contiguity matrix. U n t and U n t−1 are the unemployment rates of the whole country at times t and t − 1 , and 1 and 2 column vectors with unit-specified coefficients of response to the common factors. represent the spatial fixed effect added to the model and t is the Nx1 vector independently and identically distributed error term with zero mean and constant variance 2 . The parameter of the region's sensitivity to the economic cycle ( ) can be estimated by dividing the elements of 1 by 1 − or by dividing the elements of 2 by − − . This model allows us to simultaneously measure the four remarkable stylized facts that often arise from analyzing the evolution of regional unemployment rates. First, the presence of time correlation of the regional unemployment rates by incorporating the regional unemployment rate lagged in time as well as in time and space and the common factor (the national unemployment rate) lagged in time. Second, the model allows us to account for the presence of spatial dependence by adding the spatial lag and the spatiotemporal lag. Third this model includes the common factor and its lag in time, which allows for the estimation of an individual sensitivity parameter for each region and fourth we include spatial fixed effects which allow us to account for spatial heterogeneity. (1) U t = U t−1 + WU t + WU t−1 + 1 U n t + 2 U n t−1 + + t 5 A xtcse2 stata routine have been used (Ditzen 2019) 6 Values above the upper bound of the interval (0,1] may occur when not all the asymptotic properties are fully met (Bailey et al. 2016 ). However, since the hypothesis = 1 cannot be rejected we can conclude that estimated lies within the interval. Similar results can be also found in Vega and Elhorst (2016) . We begin by estimating the basic dynamic spatial panel data model with regional fixed effects and without including common factors (model A), and we apply both tests (CD local test and test) to the residuals of the model. These results are shown in Table 1 , column A, where it can be seen that the residuals of the model continue to point to the presence of strong spatial dependence, with = 0.920 and std. err. = 0.048 . However, the local CD test points to the fact that weak spatial dependence is no longer present ( Z = −0.838 and p value = 0.402 ), because the null hypothesis of spatial independence between neighboring regions cannot be rejected. Results shows a highly and very significant temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal lag ( = 0.891 , = 0.825 and = −0.739). Next, we estimate the model proposed by Vega and Elhorst (2016) incorporating common factors (model B). 7 Through this model, it seems that both the local spatial dependence ( Z = 1.196, p value = 0.232 ) and the presence of common factors ( = 0.255 , std. err. = 0.055 ) appear to have been effectively covered. 8 As seen in column B, the serially lagged unemployment rate ( = 0.929 ) is highly significant, reflecting the strong correlation of unemployment rates over time. In addition, the spatially lagged coefficient ( = 0.165 ) is positive and significant, reflecting the presence of spatial dependence between regions, and the lagged spatial autoregressive coefficient seems to be significant and negative. 7 We have also estimated the two-stage approach developed by Bailey et al. (2016) . An LR test comparing both models shows that the simultaneous model fits the data better and the Brechling-Thirwall type of cyclical sensitivity estimated seems to show long-lasting problems (Brechling 1967; Domazlicky 1980) where regions with estimates greater than one are those with unemployment rates persistently higher that national average. 8 The model also seems to be stationary and stable since + + < 1 Model B seems to have perfectly covered the presence of spatial dependence and common factors based on the results provided by the test. By introducing common factors, the model correctly cover the difference between spatial dependence and common factors. The and could have been overestimated in model A due to the absence of common factors. 9 Another way to account for the presence of common factors would have been to add a time-period fixed effects to the model too. However, this would be similar to the inclusion of common factors at time t with the unit-specific coefficients replaced by a time dummy with a common coefficient. 10 In Table 2 , we show the result of the coefficients of response to the national unemployment rate estimated for each of the regions ( ). Both coefficients ( 1 in t and 2 in t-1) are highly significant. The estimation of the economic cycle sensitivity parameters is shown in the last two columns ( 1 , 2). 11 The regions most sensitive to the economic cycle appear to be Comunidad Valenciana, Andalucia, Region de Murcia and Cataluña, each with parameters greater than 1.100. It seems that regions located on the Mediterranean coast share a common pattern. These communities are characterized by being the most touristy in Spain, which may be a possible explanation. Among the least sensitive communities, we find Galicia, Navarra and Castilla y Leon, each with parameters below 0.700. To show the spatial distribution of the sensitivity of the regions, Fig. 3 shows in four shades of gray the intensity of the economic cycle sensitivity of each region ( 2 ). 12 It seems that Spain has a specific sensitivity pattern where the most sensitive regions are those located on the Mediterranean coast and sensitivity decreases as we move inland to the northwest. Particularly, the economic cycle sensitivity of the regions in Spain can be divided into four groups, from the most sensitive (in darker colors) to the least sensitive (in lighter colors). The first includes the four regions most sensitive to the economic cycle of Spain, which are also those located on the Mediterranean coast (Andalucia, Region de Murcia, Comunidad Valenciana and Barcelona). The second group, formed by Extremadura and Castilla-La Mancha, are also regions that are sensitive to the economic cycle, although less so than the previous group; this second group is composed of regions located in the southern interior and neighboring the most sensitive regions. The third group is formed by regions that are not sensitive to the economic cycle and that are located in the northern interior of Spain, away from the most sensitive regions. Finally, the fourth group is formed by the least sensitive regions of Spain, Galicia and Navarra. These results seem to point to the fact that when crises and recoveries appear, the regions located on the Mediterranean coast are the ones most affected because they are the most sensitive. Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.@story_separate@In recent years, there has been a growing interest among academics, practitioners and policy makers in finding a pattern in Spanish regional unemployment trends. This interest emerges from the need to know how unemployment in each region 10 Results of this model (with log-likelihood function value of − 753.298) are quite similar with parameter = 0.896 ( std. err. = 0.018 ), = 0.230 ( std. err. = 0.046 ) and = −0.179 ( std. err. = 0.051) 11 We calculate the parameters according to the procedure proposed in Vega and Elhorst (2016) . The standard errors are calculated using formulas for the sum and quotient of random variables (Mood et al. 1974, pg. 178-181) . 12 We map parameter 2 since it is based on the relative strength of both internal and external habit of persistence (Korniotis 2010). will react ahead of the increasingly common occurrence of recession phases. In this context, the literature documents that unemployment is persistent, heterogeneous, spatially dependent and parallel to the national rate, but these effects have never been analyzed simultaneously. In our paper, by applying the methodology proposed by Vega and Elhorst (2016) , the persistence, heterogeneity, spatial dependence and economic cycle sensitivity of Spanish regional unemployment are analyzed simultaneously. Furthermore, this methodology allows us to estimate heterogeneous coefficients of response to aggregate fluctuations. The findings show that there is a high persistence of unemployment in Spain, that there is spatial dependence and that regions show different sensitivities to the economic cycle. Although the first findings are in line with the previous literature, the main contribution of this article is to uncover the geographical pattern of sensitivity to the economic cycle. We find that the economic cycle sensitivity of unemployment is not determined by the fact that regions have high or low unemployment; it seems that geographical location plays an important role. Specifically, the regions that have greater economic cycle sensitivity are located on the Mediterranean coast and include regions with very different unemployment rates. However, what these regions do have in common is that they are areas very focused on the tourism sector, which can be taken as a possible explanation. The findings are related to Melguizo (2017) who shows that regions with a more developed service sector suffer more variations in unemployment rates, and to Camacho et al. (2018) who find a similar pattern in how crises and recoveries begin and end in Spain. Both findings are in line with the regional heterogeneity we observe, since they reveal that some regions suffer more from the effects of business cycle whereas other regions are less affected by economic contingencies. Consequently, the application of national inflexible policies may difficult actions devoted to smooth cyclical swing of regional economic activity. Therefore, that, as main find, we consider that this regional behaviour is indicating the necessity to apply differentiated employment policies when national economy face a crisis. Nowadays, this find become into a crucial due to the employment destruction our regions are suffering because of the economic and labour impact caused by the restrictive measures against the COVID-19 pandemic. On the one hand, with the pattern in the trend of regional economic cycle sensitivity that this paper finds, the national government can distribute resources in an efficient way to react to future recessions or to recoveries from past crises. On the other hand, regional policies can be adapted to each geographical area depending on its sensitivity, and regional cooperation is needed since spatial dependence points to the presence of possible spillovers.","Unemployment has been routinely used as a measure of the economic cycle. In addition, regional unemployment rates are characterized by, among other factors, their relation to the national unemployment rate. In this regard, the literature on regional sensitivity to the economic cycle has analyzed how fluctuations in the national unemployment rate affect the regions. In recent years, due to the great impact of past crises, the development of new econometric techniques and the possible arrival of new crises, the debate on how sensitive regions are to the economic cycle has reopened. In Spain, this debate is necessary since unemployment rates are very high and display a great deal of heterogeneity. We analyzed regional unemployment rates in Spain between 1978 and 2018 through a recently developed dynamic spatial econometric model with common factors and found that some regions are more sensitive than others to the economic cycle. The results seem to show that in Spain, the sensitivity to the economic cycle displays a geographical pattern where the most sensitive regions are those located on the Mediterranean coast. Specifically, we find that the sensitivity to the economic cycle of unemployment is not determined by the fact that regions have high or low unemployment; it seems that geographical location plays an important role. These results can be useful for the national and regional governments when they implement countercyclical policies."
"Since our 2015 review titled ""Inhibiting the Inflammasome: A Chemical Perspective"" [1] there have been substantial developments in inflammasome biology and chemistry, with inflammasome inhibitors being tested in preclinical models for the treatment of several inflammatory disorders and entering clinical trials [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . This review focuses on the design and development of small molecule inflammasome inhibitors, with attention on the mechanism of direct NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD Domains-Containing Protein 3) inhibitors. We also discuss the potential of the published cryo-EM structure of NLRP3 bound to NEK7 (NIMA Related Kinase 7) [7] to further develop direct small molecule inhibitors of the inflammasome.@story_separate@Inflammation is generally regarded as a protective mechanism in case of infection or injury by the removal of toxins by immune cells. Non-sterile inflammation occurs from either parasites, fungi, viruses or bacteria. Sterile inflammation results from injury, foreign bodies, or hypersensitivity. Under normal conditions, immune cells are found circulating in the blood. However, upon recognition of toxins by host cells, immune cells, and their components are recruited to remove the damaging agents and promote tissue repair. Receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns The activation of the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway requires two stages. The first is the priming stage which involves myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88), and Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling responsible for the expression of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β [15] . Under normal conditions the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) maintains the NLRP3 in an auto-repressed state [15] . However, in response to a second PAMP or DAMP stimulus NLRP3 becomes active in the second stage. The pyrin domain (PYD) of active NLRP3 now binds to the PYD domain of ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (caspase recruitment domain)) resulting in a helical assembly of ASC to form the ASC speck/pyroptosome. Afterwards, CARD-CARD interaction between ASC and procaspase-1 takes place. Procaspase-1 yields caspase-1 via its own proteolytic cleavage which subsequently catalyzes the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to their active forms which cause inflammation ( Figure 1 ) [16] . Caspase-1 also leads to a type of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis resulting from gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage. GSDMD binds to lipids in the cell membrane resulting in pore formation, with cellular swelling and rupture releasing inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 ( Figure 1 ) [17] . Priming and secondary signals for NLRP3 activation and its role in inflammation. Primary signal includes activation of Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) mediated by myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) by binding of P pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to TLR, and its translocation to the nucleus to undergo transcription and translation of NLRP3 inflammasome components as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines. Secondary signals which result in NLRP3 inflammasome activation include ROS from mitochondrial disruption, cathepsins, VRAC efflux of anions and osmolytes and Ca 2+ influx. Oligomerization and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome results in cleavage of pro-inflammatory cytokines proIL-1β and proIL-18 through the action of caspase-1 to give the mature forms inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, which cause inflammation.

This figure was created under license using BioRender.com. https://biorender.com/. NLRP3 is composed of the nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD, also called the NACHT domain), a pyrin domain (PYD) at the amino terminal and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) at the carboxy terminal. The NACHT domain (ATPase domain) of NLRP3 is composed of the nucleotide binding domain (NBD), helical domains HD1 and HD2 and a winged helix domain (WHD) in between HD1 and HD2 (Figure 2a) [7] . NLRP3 is composed of the nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD, also called the NACHT domain), a pyrin domain (PYD) at the amino terminal and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) at the carboxy terminal. The NACHT domain (ATPase domain) of NLRP3 is composed of the nucleotide binding domain (NBD), helical domains HD1 and HD2 and a winged helix domain (WHD) in between HD1 and HD2 (Figure 2a) [7] . The cryo-EM structure of human NLRP3 bound to an artificially engineered dimer of NIMA (never in mitosis gene a)-related kinase 7 (NEK7) (EMD-0476, PDB-6NPY, resolution 3.8 Å) has been reported ( Figure 2b) [7] . The serine/threonine kinase NEK7 is important for NLRP3 activation [7] and is shown to bind through its C-terminal lobe to NLRP3. ATP is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation: ATP binds to the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) of NLRP3 and is hydrolyzed to ADP by the ATPase function ( Figure 2c ) [18, 19] . The energy released from either binding and/or hydrolysis of ATP is proposed to induce a conformationally modified protein, important for NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization and activation (Figure 2d) [7] . Steps involved in NLRP3 activation and oligomerization: (1) NEK7 binding, (2) ATP binding and hydrolysis with induced conformational change between the NBD and HD2, (3) dimerization of NLRP3-NEK7 activated complex, (4) oligomerization of the NLRP3-NEK7 complex with ASC and pyrin to give the NLRP3 inflammasome, (5) cleavage of procaspase-1 to mature caspase-1.

The serine/threonine kinase NEK7 is important for NLRP3 activation [7] and is shown to bind through its C-terminal lobe to NLRP3. ATP is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation: ATP binds to the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) of NLRP3 and is hydrolyzed to ADP by the ATPase function ( Figure 2c ) [18, 19] . The energy released from either binding and/or hydrolysis of ATP is proposed to induce a conformationally modified protein, important for NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization and activation (Figure 2d) [7] . It is of interest to note that two of the five conserved motifs found in NLRP1-14 NACHT include Walker A and Walker B [19] , which are protein sequences found in ATP-requiring enzymes, initially described by Walker and co-workers [20] . Walker A (P loop), characterized by the sequence G-xxxx-GK-[S/T] (x: Any amino acid), forms part of the ATP binding site responsible for ATPase activity, with the lysine residue interacting with the γ-phosphate through hydrogen-bonding [21, 22] . NEK7 is a ser/thr kinase that was found to be important for NLRP3 activation (PDB: 6NPY) [7] . To further elucidate the requirement of NEK7 for NLRP3 activation, a knockout experiment was carried out for NEK7 in iBMDMs:mutants prevented nigericin-induced NLRP3 activation whereas wild type NEK7 retained ASC-speck formation, caspase-1 processing and IL-1β release [7, 23] . NEK7 was found to bind through its C-terminal lobe to LRR through half of its lobe whilst the other half is associated with the HD2 and NBD regions [7] . NEK7 forms a dimeric complex with NLRP3, proposed to be bound together via a flexible linker [7] (Figure 2b,d) . NEK7, present in low cellular amounts, binds to NEK9 for cell division and is only bound to NLRP3 in the interphase upon exposure of NLRP3 to primary signals, thus NEK7 is a crucial modulator of inflammasome activation [7, 24] . It is important to note that NEK7 alone cannot activate NLRP3: ATP needs to be bound to the NBD domain, which phosphorylates S195 of NEK7 allowing NLRP3 to adopt its active conformation for oligomerization. The active conformer occurs when the NACHT domain rotates away from the HBD1 domain as a rigid body, resulting in a diminished point of contact between NEK7 and the NLRP3 NBD domain (Figure 2d ) [7] . It should be noted however that NEK7 dependence is not always required: When cells engage a Transforming growth factor-β-Activated Kinase 1 (TAK1)-dependent post-translational priming pathway, NEK7 is no longer required for NLRP3 activation [25] . Bertinaria and coworkers led the development of α,β-unsaturated ""electrophilic warheads"" as inflammasome inhibitors. Hits included ethyl 2-((2-chlorophenyl)(hydroxy)methyl)acrylate ( Figure 3 ) (Table 1) , which prevented the pyroptosis of THP-1 cells [26] . Chemically this Michael acceptor reacted covalently with glutathione (as a model thiol) and was also shown to inhibit NLRP3 ATPase activity [26] . (Table 1) , a small molecule identified through screening in an in-house bioactive compound library in mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) against NLRP3, has an IC 50 of 6µM. Furthermore, CY-09 causes inhibition of IL-1β and caspase-1 activity in synovial fluid cells from patients with gout. CY-09 has been proposed to be a direct covalent modifier of the NLRP3 inflammasome, preventing its oligomerization by binding to the ATP-binding site of the NACHT domain [27] . CY-09 has an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl Michael acceptor group which binds covalently with a nucleophile on the Walker A site [27] , although this reaction may be reversible (see SI [28] ). Computational docking and molecular dynamics simulations on NLRP NACHT protein models with apo and halo ADP-/ATP-Mg 2+ were used to investigate how CY-09 inhibits ATPase and inhibits NLRP3 activation [27] . (Table 1 ) [29] . INF39 was reported as a non-toxic irreversible NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor with an IC 50 of 10 µM (Table 1 ) [30] . INF58 inhibited the ATPase activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome with an IC 50 of 74 µM, the proposed mechanism being through the covalent reaction of C419 with the Michael acceptor in INF58 ( Figure 4 ) ( Table 1 ) [31] . OLT1177 (dapansutrile) was found to prevent the NLRP3 interaction with ASC through the inhibition of ATPase, resulting in inhibition of IL-1β and IL-18 release from J774 macrophages with an IC 50 of 1 nM (Table 1 ) [32] . (Table 1 ) [29] . INF39 was reported as a non-toxic irreversible NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor with an IC50 of 10 µM (Table 1 ) [30] . INF58 inhibited the ATPase activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome with an IC50 of 74 µ M, the proposed mechanism being through the covalent reaction of C419 with the Michael acceptor in INF58 ( Figure 4 ) ( Table 1 ) [31] . OLT1177 (dapansutrile) was found to prevent the NLRP3 interaction with ASC through the inhibition of ATPase, resulting in inhibition of IL-1β and IL-18 release from J774 macrophages with an IC50 of 1 nM (Table 1 ) [32] . Oridonin (Figure 4) , an electrophilic natural ent-kaurane diterpenoid derivative obtained from Rabdosia rubescens, showed anti-inflammatory activity with an IC50 of ~0.75 M. In contrast to the other Michael acceptors which inhibit ATPase activity, oridonin forms a covalent link with C279, blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and NEK7 and preventing a conformational change, thus inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation (Table 1 ) [28] . Oridonin (Figure 4) , an electrophilic natural ent-kaurane diterpenoid derivative obtained from Rabdosia rubescens, showed anti-inflammatory activity with an IC 50 of~0.75 µM. In contrast to the other Michael acceptors which inhibit ATPase activity, oridonin forms a covalent link with C279, blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and NEK7 and preventing a conformational change, thus inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation (Table 1 ) [28] . [19] . MCC950 (also known as CP-456773 and CRID3) ( Figure 5a ) is a potent and well-studied inflammasome lead compound, which inhibits NLRP3-dependent ASC oligomerization, with an IC 50 of 7.5 nM in BMDMs (Table 1 ) [33] . MCC950 did not compete with ATP upon exposure to wild-type NLRP3∆LRR, showing that it was unlikely to bind at the Walker A site. The following mechanism of action studies provided evidence that MCC950 binds with high affinity to the Walker B site, and was proposed to form a complex with ATP. Vande Walle and coworkers [34] designed a cell-penetrant photo-affinity label (PAL) probe attached to an MCC950 analogue, PAL-CRID3, which inhibited NLRP3 [34] . Upon UV exposure of PAL-CRID3, the photo-reactive benzophenone undergoes covalent binding to the active site. The alkyne group of PAL-CRID3 reacts with a 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) fluorescent reporter using click chemistry, which after cell lysis allows for in-gel fluorescence detection and separation of the covalent MCC950-protein adduct by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, showing direct binding of PAL-CRID3 to NLRP3 (Figure 5b ) [34] . Furthermore, Coll and coworkers also designed a photoaffinity probe of MCC950: PAP was covalently cross-linked to its target when activated by UV light, which was then reacted with biotin-PEG3-azide via Cu(1)-catalysed click chemistry and purified using streptavidin magnetic beads (Figure 5c ), again supporting binding of MCC950 close to the Walker B site [35] . Tapia-Abellán and coworkers [36] used Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) to study the molecular conformation of NLRP3 and showed that MCC950 results in closure of the open active conformation of NLRP3 to an inactive state [36] . Coll and coworkers [35] investigated the protein-ligand interaction formed between MCC950 and the NACHT domain using a drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay. The principle is based on the protein being resistant to degradation by proteases once it is stabilized by interaction with the inhibitor. MCC950 protected NLRP3 from proteolytic degradation supporting its direct interaction with NLRP3 [35] . In summary, these mechanism of action studies show that MCC950 is proposed to bind non-covalently with high affinity close to the Walker B site on NLRP3. This prevents a structural conformational change of the ATP-binding site keeping the NLRP3 inflammasome in an inactive state, preventing hydrolysis of ATP needed for NLRP3 assembly [34] [35] [36] . A small clinical study with MCC950 was carried out by Pfizer for rheumatoid arthritis, however increasing concentrations of MCC950 gave rise to an increased risk of liver toxicity, causing the development of MCC950 to cease after phase 1b testing [37] . Attention was then focused by some companies and academia to discover less toxic analogues of MCC950, which are discussed in the next section. carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) fluorescent reporter using click chemistry, which after cell lysis allows for in-gel fluorescence detection and separation of the covalent MCC950-protein adduct by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, showing direct binding of PAL-CRID3 to NLRP3 (Figure 5b) [34] . Furthermore, Coll and coworkers also designed a photoaffinity probe of MCC950: PAP was covalently cross-linked to its target when activated by UV light, which was then reacted with biotin-PEG3-azide via Cu(1)-catalysed click chemistry and purified using streptavidin magnetic beads (Figure 5c ), again supporting binding of MCC950 close to the Walker B site [35] .

Nodthera has been granted patents on NLRP3 inhibitors covering carbamoyl derivatives [41] . NodThera has reported NT-0167, which has shown promising NLRP3 inhibition reducing IL-1β production in preclinical studies and is currently under investigation in healthy volunteers in phase I clinical trials [42] . Potent membrane permeable urea ester prodrugs, inspired by MCC950, have been reported as NLRP3 inhibitors, the most active being 2-[(phenylcarbamoyl)amino]acetates containing 2-pyrimidine (1) or 2-pyrazine (2) groups ( Figure 6) , with IC 50s of 36 nM and 30 nM for the inhibition of IL-1β in PBMC cells (Table 2 ). These two compounds were shown to be equipotent to MCC950, however they showed enhanced activity (1, 20-fold and 2, 8-fold) when tested in the whole blood assay when compared with MCC950 [43, 44] . [4, 45, 46] . O'Neill and coworkers hold a patent on sulfonylureas, including MCC950 ( Figure 5 ) and MCC7840 ( Figure 6 ) which inhibited NLRP3 with IC50 values of <100 nM [47] . The University of Queensland and Cadila have disclosed NLRP3 inhibitors, with the novel substituted sulfoximine compound (3) being the most active with a low nM IC50 value in THP1 cells ( Figure 6 ) (Table 2) [48] . It has recently been reported that this series of N-cyano sulfoximine urea derivatives were highly potent and selective towards NLRP3 inhibition, showing good pharmacokinetic profiles with oral bioavailability. The most active compounds 4-7 gave IC50 values of 5, 7, 12 and 23 nM, respectively, in the IL-1β inhibition assay in mice ( Figure 6) (Table 2) [49] . Inflazome, a biotech company whose vision is to develop potent, best-in-class, small molecule NLRP3 modulators for the treatment of a broad range of inflammatory diseases, has been granted US and Europe patents for its potent and selective lead NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors: Somalix (peripheral) is in phase 2 clinical trials and inzomelid (CNS penetrant) has completed phase 1 [4,45,46]. O'Neill and coworkers hold a patent on sulfonylureas, including MCC950 ( Figure 5 ) and MCC7840 ( Figure 6 ) which inhibited NLRP3 with IC 50 values of <100 nM [47] . The University of Queensland and Cadila have disclosed NLRP3 inhibitors, with the novel substituted sulfoximine compound (3) being the most active with a low nM IC 50 value in THP1 cells ( Figure 6 ) ( Table 2 ) [48] . It has recently been reported that this series of N-cyano sulfoximine urea derivatives were highly potent and selective towards NLRP3 inhibition, showing good pharmacokinetic profiles with oral bioavailability. The most active compounds 4-7 gave IC 50 values of 5, 7, 12 and 23 nM, respectively, in the IL-1β inhibition assay in mice (Figure 6 ) ( Table 2) [49] . A homology model of NLRP3 was prepared from the crystal structure of NLRC4 and the FASTA sequence of human NLRP3 (www.uniprot.org).

Inhibitors either have an indirect effect or a direct effect on NLRP3 and in this review there is a focus on those with a direct effect.

Inflammasomes form part of the innate immune system that triggers the activation of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. The inflammasome most studied in sterile inflammation and non-communicable disease is the NLRP3 inflammasome. Upon activation by diverse pathogen or disease associated signals, NLRP3 nucleates the oligomerization of an adaptor protein ASC forming a platform (the inflammasome) for the recruitment and activation of the protease caspase-1. Active caspase-1 catalyzes the processing and release of IL-1β and IL-18, and via cleavage of the pore forming protein gasdermin D can drive pyroptotic cell death. This review focuses on the structural basis and mechanism for NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in the context of drug design, providing chemical structures, activities, and clinical potential of direct inflammasome inhibitors. A cryo-EM structure of NLRP3 bound to NEK7 protein provides structural insight and aids in the discovery of novel NLRP3 inhibitors utilizing ligand-based or structure-based approaches."
"In 2020 a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 struck the world through widespread human transmission (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020), creating fears of a new plague similar to the Spanish Flu in 1918 , Mexican Smallpox in 1967 , AIDS in the early 1980s, SARS in 2002 /03, Bird Flu in 2005 , Swine Flu in 2009 /10, and Ebola in 2014 (Harari et al., 2007 . First discovered by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention , the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the region of Wuhan in the Central Hubei Province of China on 31 st December 2019 TWC India, 2020) . Rising global death tolls combined with the high infectivity of the virus, mild clinical symptoms, an uncertain incubation period, lack of pre-existing human immunity, and the possibility of asymptomatic healthy carriers (Bouey, 2020) led to the WHO declaring COVID-19 a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)"" on 30 th January 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020a) . COVID-19 is transmitted via droplets and fomites (contact with contaminated surfaces) (Bouey, 2020), with children less affected than adults and the elderly. A coronavirus patient can transmit the disease to three people on average without intervention (compared with one for the common influenza, two for Ebola, and 18 for measles) . Symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild clinical symptoms similar to the common cold or flu (Guo et al., 2020; Peeriet al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) , with major symptoms appearing 2-14 days from infection and including trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, mental confusion or inability to arouse, and bluish lips or face (CDC, 2020) . Those with persistence symptoms often require specialized respiratory management at intensive care units (Chan et al., 2020; Rodriguez-Morales et al., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f To-date there is no known specific and effective pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 (Cortegiani et al., 2020) . Despite China's preventative measures to control the spread of COVID-19, several other countries are still struggling to contain the virus (Dong et al., 2020) . Various pandemic risk reduction measures such as social distancing, cluster lockdowns, mass quarantines, extensive travel bans, and disruptions to transportation systems have had a direct impact on local and global socio-political relations and economic growth (Long and Feng, 2020) . Such extreme measures to control the virus have potentially resulted in decreases of aerosols and atmospheric pollutants due to the disruption of anthropogenic-based emissions (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-the-week-the-world-shutdown). Aerosols have direct and indirect contributions on climate change at regional and global scales (Huang et al., 2014; Menon et al., 2002; Qian and Giorgi, 1999) as increased levels of aerosol optical depth (AOD) affects atmospheric stability and precipitation as aerosols disturb the scattering and absorption of solar radiation (Jiang et al., 2016) , the hydrological cycle (Prasad et al., 2004) and vegetation cover and its growth (Lal et al., 2019; Sarkar and Kafatos, 2004) . In addition to climatic effects, aerosols increase respiratory problems in humans and decrease visibility in urban areas (Prasad et al., 2005) . A study on the 2002/03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) showed a positive relationship between long term exposure to air pollution (PM 10 , NO 2 , CO, O 3 , and SO 2 ) in China and a higher risk of dying (84%) in regions of moderate and high air pollution index (Cui et al.,@story_separate@J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak had brought major economic disruption in the world (Khan et al., 2020; WTO, 2020) , with disruptions in global supply chains, business and consumer confidence, the decline in commodity prices, international tourism and business travel, and less demand for imported goods and services (Boone et al., 2020) . The long-term economic impacts include changes in health care expenditure as well as downstream impacts of COVID-19 on mortality and morbidity (Abiad et al., 2020) , with a rapid increase in economic anxiety in the population at-large (Fetzer et al., 2020) . Human coronaviruses have shown strong winter seasonality between December and April, becoming undetectable in the summer months in temperate regions of the world (Gaunt et al., 2010) . Average temperature (5-11°C), relative humidity (RH: 47-79%) and latitude profiles exhibited similarity in the timing of COVID-19 outbreak during January 2020 in Wuhan, China, and February 2020 in other affected regions (Sajadi et al., 2020) . Similarly, 90% of COVID-19 cases have been reported in countries with a temperature range of 3° to 17°C and between an absolute humidity (AH) of 4 to 9 g m -3 (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020). Laboratory conditions conducive to the survival of the members of the coronavirus family are low temperatures (4°C), and moderate to high RH (20-80%) (Casanova et al., 2010) . However, the SARS-CoV-2 may survive for several days on plastics and metals at moderate temperatures (between 21-23°C) and a RH of 40% (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . This suggests there may be a direct relationship between temperature, humidity, environmental pollutants, and the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the objectives of the present study are to (i) assess the status of COVID-19 cases across the globe, (ii) study the meteorological correlates of COVID-19 occurrences, and (ii) assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f We used satellite data, COVID-19 reported case data, and meteorological data (Table 1) to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on the global environment. The country-wise cumulative cases of COVID-19 affected-population and death tolls were acquired from WHO (https://www.who.int) and analyzed on a weekly basis until 10 April 2020 in a GIS environment. Temperature and relative humidity hourly datasets of 0.25° were taken from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu) used to calculate Absolute Humidity. Data on the weekly concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), NO 2 , and AOD for the period of 01 January to 21 April 2020 were acquired and analyzed. The same datasets were acquired for the period of 01 January to 21 April 2019 to compare the variability of said parameters. Standardized anomalies (SA) of AOD and near-surface air temperature (2m above the surface) for January to March was estimated using equation 1. .…. Eq 1 Climate Data Operator (CDO) tool was used to estimate standard deviations and climatological mean. Projected near-surface air temperature, and relative humidity (RH) datasets acquired from CIMIP-5 model at RCP 8.5 scenario until November 2020 and were used to estimate the possible impacts of COVID-19 on different countries under future meteorological conditions. Absolute Humidity was calculated using Clausius Clapeyron J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and Jameel, 2020). Therefore, global COVID-19 hazard assessment was estimated based on AH on future projected data for the period of April to November 2020. The AH-based hazard map was classified into 4 different classes considering their possible habitat suitability viz., high hazard (AH: 4 to 9 g m -3 ), moderate hazard (AH: 2 to 4 g m -3 and 9 to 12 g m -3 ), low hazard (AH: <2 and 12 to 15 g m -3 ) and very low hazard (AH: >15 g m -3 ).  The cases related to COVID-19 affected population and death tolls were mapped and analysed ( Figure 1 ). A total of 1240239 persons with confirmed cases and 81661 deaths occurred due to COVID-19 around the world till 10 th April 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020b). The majority of COVID-19 infected cases, as well as death, were reported in the European region (52.6% of total infected persons and 71.4% of total death tolls) followed by the region of Americas (32.4% infections and 18.4% deaths), Western Pacific region (7.7% infections and 4.3% deaths), Eastern Mediterranean region (5.8% infected persons and 5.0% deaths), South-East Asian region (0.9% infections and 0.6% deaths) and African region (0.6% infections and 0.4% deaths) ( Figure 1 ). On the other hand, the percentage of deaths with reference to the total number of confirmed cases was highest in the European region (8.3%), followed by the Eastern Mediterranean region (5.2%), South-East Asian region (4.4%), and African region (4.3%) with the lowest deaths as compared to confirmed cases reported from the region of Americas (3.5%) and Western Pacific region (3.4%) ( Table 2) . The global country-wise assessment indicated the majority of affected populations were from the United States of America (34.34% of the global cases), followed by Spain (12.29%), Italy J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (11.58%), Germany (9.15%), France (6.88%), China (6.72%), Iran (5.34%) and UK (5.25%). While COVID-19 initially came to attention in the Hubei province of China and subsequently spread to many other regions of the world through global travel (Huang et al., 2020) due to its highly transmissible nature (Bogoch et al., 2020), a consistent pattern of COVID-19 cases was observed from east to west along the 30 o to 50 o N latitude including South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Northern Italy. Notably, COVID-19 failed to significantly spread to countries immediately south of China as the number of patients and reported deaths in Southeast Asia was much lower compared to temperate regions (Dong et al., 2020) . High temperatures (> 40°C) and extremely low temperatures (< 4°C) restrict the spread of the members of the coronavirus family (Casanova et al., 2010) and is expected to diminish COVID-19 considerably in affected areas above 30°N in the coming months (Sajadi et al., 2020) . The continent level assessment showed that Europe (799696) was severely affected, with the country of Spain (152446) being the most affected country followed by Italy (143626) (3512) were moderately affected, though the number of cases was increasing rapidly. A very low number of cases were reported from J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f hands could be another reason for widespread of COVID-19. However, the transportation mechanism in western countries, which enables less person to person contact due to usage of personal transport, in contrast to public transport in tropical countries, could be a major source of spread of COVID-19. Health Organization, 2020b), and this pattern proved to be true in other heavily infected countries in Europe and North America. In the United States, 80% of deaths were individuals over 65 years of age (CDC, 2020). Meanwhile, Italy the home to the oldest population in Europe and the second-oldest population in the world, was the most prone to the virus, with 12.8% of the 70-79 age category and 20.2% of those over 80 years of age more likely to die upon infection by COVID-19 (Dutta, 2020; Horowitz, 2020) . Despite this higher death rate, individuals living in Italy have a significantly longer life expectancy than those individuals living in China (Godin, 2020) . This figure is difficult to determine as age-related comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension have also been shown to be highly correlated with COVID-19 deaths. The death of COVID-19 patients J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f without pre-existing medical conditions was very low (only 0.9%), while the likelihood of dying for patients with pre-existing medical conditions like cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%) and chronic respiratory disease (6.3%) was very high (  Global temperature and absolute humidity were mapped using ERA-5 reanalysis data during the COVID-19 outbreak period (January to March 2020) on a weekly basis to deduce Spatiotemporal variations. An increase in temperature was observed in tropical regions (30°S to 30°N latitude) as compared to temperate regions due to seasonality variations (figure 3).  Nearly half of the world is under partial or complete lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak, leading to the shutdown of industries and motor vehicles and an associated reduction in the concentration of atmospheric pollutants. In the present study, the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on environmental pollution has been studied using spatio-temporal satellite-based products related to NO 2 , CO, and AOD. Major changes were observed in South Asia and South-East Asian countries including major parts of Indian regions like the IGP, where NO 2 concentration was drastically reduced during the 12 th to 16 th week as compared to previous weeks due to the shutdown of various industries and a travel ban issued on 24 th March 2020. In Western Africa, major changes were observed from 7 th and 8 th week and had been continuously decreasing, whereas major changes in Europe were observed 12 th week onwards. Besides, the variation in global NO 2 concentration is influenced by global wind circulations (Arya, 1999; Grundstrom et al., 2015; Santurtún et al., 2017) . A sharp reduction in NO 2 concentration occurred across the globe, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f primarily in the Southern Hemisphere and tropical regions during January to March 2020. As compared to 2019, other highly populated regions of the world (Europe, North America, and IGP) had also observed low (<0.00003 mol m -2 ) to moderate (<0.00005 mol m -2 ) reductions in NO 2 during 2020. These trends may be attributed to regional variations in the timing of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the implementation of preventive measures. The incomplete burning of carbon-based fuels leads to the generation of CO which is spread by wind circulation patterns throughout the lower atmosphere (Novelli et al., 1998) . The weekly monitoring of global CO column number density based on daily observation of showing an increase with reference to the previous weeks, which may be attributed by the coverage of desert or proximity to the sea. The standard anomaly of AOD with reference to the long term monthly mean (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) (2017) (2018) (2019) was also evaluated. The study exhibited an increase in area under negative anomaly (  The future projections of absolute humidity based on the CIMIP-5 model at RCP 8.5 scenario until November 2020 were used to deduce the possible contribution of meteorological conditions to COVID-19 spread following January-March 2020 variations in AH and Bukhari and Jameel, (2020) concepts of virus transmission at the different threshold of AH. AH plays a significant role in the transmission of SARS- CoV-2 (Carleton and Meng, 2020; Ficetola and Rubolini, 2020; Luo et al., 2020; Oliveiros et al., 2020) . A peak rate of spread of COVID-19 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere having a mean temperature of ~5°C, and AH of 4 to 9 g m -3 during the outbreak period was observed, while it was lower both in warmer/wetter and colder/drier regions (Ficetola and Rubolini, 2020). Nevertheless, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f changes in weather alone (i.e., increases or decreases of temperature and humidity) will not necessarily lead to declines in case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions (Luo et al., 2020) . Therefore, a prospective global COVID-19 hazard based on AH from April to November 2020 was mapped and analysed (figure 8). The study projected an increasing coverage of high COVID-19 hazard in a large part of the globe during April to July 2020 due to high prospective meteorological suitability (AH: 4 to 9 g m -3 ). The study illustrated a severe and high probability of COVID outbreak in major parts of the Northern Hemisphere as compared to the Southern Hemisphere during May-July 2020 barring primarily tropical regions. Thereafter, a reduction in COVID-19 hazard may be evident in the tropical and subtropical regions during August-September 2020 due to variations in regional meteorological conditions. Later, in October-November 2020, COVID-19 hazard will be resurgent in the tropical and subtropical regions (primarily in the Northern Hemisphere) and reduced in temperate and sub-temperate regions of the globe. In the Asian continent, virus transmission has a low possibility except in China as the majority of countries will have moderate AH (2 to 4 g m -3 and >10 g m -3 ) until September 2020 ( Figure   8 ). The study indicated severe COVID-19 pandemic hazard in the coming months due to meteorological suitability apart from local transmissions. Thus, there are uncertainties associated with our model predictions. Hence, we advise the end users to practise caution while using the predictions.@story_separate@Based on the above discussion, we conclude that the intensity of transmission of COVID-19 is not uniform in spite of its global spread. Mortality is positively correlated with age-group as well as severe pre-existing medical conditions. There has been a substantial reduction in the emission of atmospheric pollutants viz., NO 2 and AOD because of forced shutdowns reflecting high fossil fuel consumption based human lifestyles in the developed countries. In general, meteorological factors may not be directly related to the number of outbreaks. However, countries with temperatures between 4°C±2°C to ~19°C±2°C and AH: 4 to 9 g m -3 are at a higher risk of COVID-19 outbreak despite preventive measures. Therefore, in the upcoming months, i.e., May-July 2020, the Northern Hemisphere may be more susceptible to outbreaks compared to tropical regions. However, tropical regions may be prone to outbreaks during the onset of winter in October, and November 2020 and appropriate actions and policy interventions should be implemented at local as well as international levels to contain COVID-19 outbreaks and minimize the consequent damages. International consensus is required for such extreme measures to take place and to ensure the long-term survival of Table 1 : Details of data used J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f","Abstract The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous suffering and huge economic losses. We hypothesized that extreme measures of partial-to-total shutdown might have influenced the quality of the global environment because of decreased emissions of atmospheric pollutants. We tested this hypothesis using satellite imagery, climatic datasets (temperature, and absolute humidity), and COVID-19 cases available in the public domain. While the majority of the cases were recorded from Western countries, where mortality rates were strongly positively correlated with age, the number of cases in tropical regions was relatively lower than European and North American regions, possibly attributed to faster human-to-human transmission. There was a substantial reduction in the level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2: 0.00002 mol m−2), a low reduction in CO (<0.03 mol m−2), and a low-to-moderate reduction in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD: ~0.1–0.2) in the major hotspots of COVID-19 outbreak during February–March 2020, which may be attributed to the mass lockdowns. Our study projects an increasing coverage of high COVID-19 hazard at absolute humidity levels ranging from 4 to 9 g m−3 across a large part of the globe during April–July 2020 due to a high prospective meteorological suitability for COVID-19 spread. Our findings suggest that there is ample scope for restoring the global environment from the ill-effects of anthropogenic activities through temporary shutdown measures."
"Evidence suggest that 25-hydroxy vitamin D-a major circulatory metabolite of vitamin D-stimulates production of protective peptide in response to any viral or bacterial infection. 1 In case of vitamin D deficiency, this mechanism is hampered and makes host susceptible to the variety of infection including respiratory tract infections. Effect of vitamin D supplementation on acute respiratory tract infection has been established by many randomized controlled trials. 2, 3 It was observed that irrespective of age, sex and study duration, vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of acute respiratory tract infection in all the patients. 4, 5 The benefits were also found to be dose-dependent and profound in individuals with deficiency of vitamin D at baseline. 5, 6 Novel coronavirus-COVID-19-is a respiratory disease that causes inflammation and irritation in upper and lower respiratory tract. In severe cases, it travels through alveoli and as a response there is respiratory inflammation that can be visualized on chest X-ray or CT image as 'ground-glass opacity'. 7 These characteristics share similarities with previously reported respiratory infections and hence remedies showing promising effect in management of them were also explored for potential use during COVID-19 infections. Initially, it was observed that the COVID-19 patients with vitamin D deficiency had poorer outcomes with longer stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and are at higher mortality rates than their counterparts. 8 Numerous attempts in the form of systematic reviews and meta-analysis assess the potential role of vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 infection, severity and mortality. [9] [10] [11] However majority of the reviews remained inconclusive and highlighted the need for more primary studies in the form of randomized controlled trials. [9] [10] [11] Similarly, unlike other respiratory tract diseases, evidence showing effect of supplementation of oral vitamin D on improving the outcome of COVID-19 is still limited to few trials with smaller sample size. Current meta-analysis aimed to synthesize cumulative evidences from the studies reporting the effect of vitamin D supplementation on ICU stay and mortality outcomes in patients suffering from COVID-19 infections.@story_separate@In accordance with the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA), current systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. 11 'Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions' was followed for planning and conducting the review. 12, 13 Search strategies and data extraction For retrieving eligible articles reporting effect of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 outcome, MEDLINE (through PubMed and CENTRAL using MeSH Terms), Google Scholar, and Preprint servers were searched. Search terms related to vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19 were designed to obtain relevant articles from the databases. The articles published between December 2019 and 17 December 2020 were independently screened by two reviewers. Initially articles were screened using title and abstract; after this, eligible articles were evaluated separately by two reviewers using full text. We aimed to include any study that assessed effect of vitamin D supplementation (irrespective of dose and form) on ICU admission and mortality in laboratory-confirmed COVID cases. Discordance between the authors was settled by discussion, and any difference of opinion that arose was resolved through mutual consensus. Articles published in English language were included in the study. Other language articles were also included if English summary was available. Included articles were also looked for additional studies through reference list searching, and any eligible article found was included in the review. Relevant details from each screened article were extracted in an electronic data collection matrix by two reviewers independently. After final selection, three articles were found eligible for the review; of them, two were randomized controlled trials and one was retrospective study. The detailed PRISMA chart regarding search is presented as Figure 1 . The randomized controlled trials were assessed for risk of bias using Cochrane tool, 12 and quality of each trial was studied by all two reviewers and any discrepancy was addressed through re-evaluation and consensus among the authors. Quality score was generated using various criteria-randomization, doubleblinding and dropouts on five methodological domains-random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other potential threats to validity. Based on the score generated on different aspects, the studies were categorized into low risk, moderate risk and high risk categories. For the observational study ""Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Nonrandomized Studies (RoBANS)"" 14 for the controlled observational studies, as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions was used. The study was assessed based on six factors: (i) the selection of participants, (ii) confounding variables, (iii) measurements of exposure, (iv) blinding of outcome assessments, (v) incomplete outcome data and (vi) selective outcome reporting. Based on the factors, the study was categorized into either high, unclear or low risk of bias category. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan) Version 5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). The software was used for pooling the data and deriving cumulative effect of the intervention on outcome of interest. The results were specifically assessed for presence of heterogeneity using Q statistics (significant at P < 0.10). I2-a quantitative measure of heterogeneity-was used to categorize studies into various levels of heterogeneity (high: 75-100%, medium: 50-70% and low: 0-50%). In case of I2 more than 50% two-tailed values of random-effect model were considered to measure the impact of an intervention, whereas fixed effect model was applied for the cases having I2 <50%. Cumulative results showing improvement in ICU need and mortality rates with vitamin D supplementation are presented using forest plots. Publication bias was assessed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The presence or absence of statically significant bias was concluded from the quantitative results of Egger's and Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test, whereas visual inspection of bias was undertaken using Funnel plot. Forest plot was used to display the relative treatment effect and its 95% CI for each study. The final systematic review and meta-analysis included three studies, 15-17 two randomized controlled trials and one retrospective case-control study. The detailed characteristics of the study are presented in Table 1 . The review included details from 532 hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients. Though all the studies used oral supplementation of vitamin D, the duration and dosage of treatment varied. The details are provided in Table 1 . The methodological quality of included studies was reasonably fair, as all three studies had a low risk of bias. The cumulative effect of vitamin D supplementation on ICU admission and mortality in hospitalized patients of COVID-19 were assessed using meta-analysis. It was observed that there is a statistically significant (P < 0.0001) difference between ICU admission rate in patients with vitamin D supplements as compared to patients without the supplementations (odds ratio: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.210-0.626; Table 2; Figure 2 ). Though all three studies favored the intervention arm, the degree of impact varied among the studies and that resulted in heterogeneity as indicated by higher I2 (82.94%) and deviation from funnel shape ( Figure 4 ). Removal of one study, Murai et al., has reduced the heterogeneity and indicated significant reduction in the overall ICU needs with vitamin D supplementation. However, the studies were free from any significant publication bias as assessed by Egger's and Begg's tests (Table 3) . Meta-analysis of morality proportion in both groups was assessed and compared. It was found that vitamin D supplements have no effect on mortality as compared to placebo treatment/usual care (odds ratio: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.413-2.113; P ¼ 0.87; Table 4 ; Figure 3 ). The findings were consistent with no heterogeneity as indicated by I2 (21.71%; P ¼ 0.27). Even the funnel plot showed a satisfactory distribution of the studies ( Figure  5) . Similarly, Egger's and Begg's tests showed the absence of any significant publication bias (P > 0.05).  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that synthesized cumulative evidences assessing impact of vitamin D supplementation on intensive care needs and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It was observed that as compared to conventional care, vitamin D reduces severity of the disease; however, the results regarding improving mortality statistics could not reach to a statistically significant conclusion. The first study conducted by Castillo et al. 15 randomized 76 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients in intervention to control group in ratio of 2:1 in Spain. The patients in the intervention arm received soft capsules of calcifediol (0.532 mg) on the day of admission through oral route and continued with the oral calcifediol (0.266 mg) on Days 3 and 7 and then weekly until discharge or ICU admission, whereas the patients in the control arm followed the standard treatment protocol with combination of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg every 12 h on the first day, and 200 mg every 12 h for the following 5 days) and azithromycin (500 mg orally for 5 days). Though baseline characteristics of patients in both the arms were matched, controls were more hypertensive (57.69% vs. 24.19%; P ¼ 0.002). To adjust the effect of the confounders such as hypertension and diabetes, authors applied multivariate logistic regression analysis and found that the lower probability of ICU admission in intervention still remained significant [odds ratio ¼ 0.03 (95% CI: 0.003 À 0.25)] as compared to control. Similarly, the mortality rates were also lower in patients treated with calciferol; however, it could not reach to a statistically significant level possibly due to extremely lower number of patients with adverse outcome. However, authors also acknowledged potential confounding effect of obesity and pre-existing deficiency of vitamin D as limitation of study. They recommended need of more extensive research with appropriately matched arms. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Brazil conducted by Murai et al. 16 showed an effect of a single dose of 200 000 IU of vitamin D3 supplementation to hospital stay in severely ill COVID-19 patients. During the trial, 240 patients were equally randomized either in vitamin D supplementation or in placebo arm. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between both the arms. Though the supplementation was found to be safe and it improved serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, it did not translate into any clinical benefits to the patient in the form of reduced hospital stay, the requirement of ICU support or 10 .4%) between both the groups. The study also compared the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in hospitalized COVID patients and compared it with the population-based controls of similar age and sex. It was found that the patients had significantly low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D as compared to population-based controls even in the presence of main confounding factors. However, the observational nature of the study was accepted as one of the important limitations. One important finding emerged from the study was that unlike other reports there was no relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the parameters of COVID-19 severity, such as ICU admission, the need for mechanical ventilation or mortality. This might be due to smaller number of events in the groups. However, it also highlights the need to assess vitamin D supplementation's effect in a prospective manner using the randomized controlled trial study design. SHADE study, 18 a randomized controlled trial, assessed effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation (60 000 IU of cholecalciferol-oral nano-liquid droplets) on 21-day recovery in COVID-19 patients. The authors found that greater proportion of vitamin D-deficient individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection turned COVID-19 negative with a significant decrease in fibrinogen on high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation. However, they did not assess the role of supplementation on ICU requirement and mortality and hence were not included in the current meta-analysis. Despite this heterogeneity among the studies, cumulative findings of the meta-analysis favored vitamin D supplementation for reduction of COVID-19 severity. However, more trials are required to substantiate the findings on other outcomes, especially community based and in-hospital trials should also be conducted in developing countries to assess potential of vitamin D supplementation in reducing hospitalization-, ICU-and ventilation needs and mortality rates. The quality of meta-analysis is directly proportionate to the quality of available secondary literature. As this meta-analysis is based on very early outcome reports exploring impact of vitamin D on various outcome indicators of COVID-19, it suffers from some inherent limitations as follows: 1. Number of trial available right now provides insufficient information regarding effect of various doses and appropriate duration of therapy on the outcome of interest. All three studies included in the meta-analysis used vitamin D supplementation for different duration and at different dosage. Evaluation of the impact using a standard protocol needs to be explored to understand exact effect of the intervention on various indicators. 2. The studies are also underpowered to assess the impact of supplementation in patients having severe deficiency of vitamin D at baseline. More robust randomized controlled trials with sufficient sample power are needed to obtain detailed understanding of these limitations. 3. Similarly, the baseline characteristics of the population enrolled in the studies were heterogeneous with respect to other comorbid conditions. Due to limited number of available evidences, assessment of vitamin D effect in these individual groups was not possible.@story_separate@The findings of current meta-analysis suggest a potential role of vitamin D in reducing COVID-19 severity. However additional evidences with larger sample size and prospective study designs are needed to substantiate it further. Conflict of interest. None declared.","Objective: Current meta-analysis aims to understand the effect of oral supplementation of vitamin D on intensive care unit (ICU) requirement and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: Databases PubMed, preprint servers, and google scholar were searched from December 2019 to December 2020. Authors searched for the articles assessing role of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19. Cochrane RevMan tool was used for quantitative assessment of the data, where heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and Q statistics and data was expressed using odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Results: Final meta-analysis involved pooled data of 532 hospitalized patients (189 on vitamin D supplementation and 343 on usual care/placebo) of COVID-19 from three studies (Two randomized controlled trials, one retrospective case-control study). Statistically (p<0.0001) lower ICU requirement was observed in patients with vitamin D supplementation as compared to patients without supplementations (odds ratio: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.210-0.626). However, it suffered from significant heterogeneity, which reduced after sensitivity analysis. In case of mortality, vitamin D supplements has comparable findings with placebo treatment/usual care (odds ratio: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.413-2.113; p=0.87). The studies did not show any publication bias and had fair quality score. Subgroup analysis could not be performed due to limited number of studies and hence dose and duration dependent effect of vitamin D could not be evaluated. Conclusions: Although the current meta-analysis findings indicate potential role of vitamin D in improving COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients, more robust data from randomized controlled trials are needed to substantiate its effects on mortality."
"Judicial review ""under extreme conditions"" has an inglorious history in the Philippines. The Supreme Court, by deferring to the Executive Branch, held that the factual bases for declaring an emergency are beyond the pale of judicial review. The Court's deference aided the regime of Ferdinand Marcos by laying the legal scaffolding that gave him free reign in administering his martial law regime. When Marcos was ousted by protests in 1986, the new government drafted a constitution that strengthened the role of the Judiciary in extreme conditions by giving it, among others, the power to review the factual bases of emergency situations. The Supreme Court, however, has been reluctant in applying these new powers, and has crafted a mechanism that makes judicial review the final, and not a primary remedy for the abuse of power. The Court's reluctance in assuming a more powerful role stems from institutional competence constraints. The Supreme Court is unable to do more than to defer to the Executive branch in a field where it admittedly lacks technical knowledge; it slips into its traditional role of bystander instead of an active player. Institutional competence ""goes to the respective abilities of courts versus legislatures or Executive officers to decide a particular question."" 1 Proponents of this view say that only issues that can be resolved by reasoned argument are appropriate for judicial resolution. When courts go beyond this role, they endanger their legitimacy as legal institutions because they assert an unjustifiable claim to political superiority, and because they act beyond their area of competence. 2 Post-Marcos Philippines demonstrates that a constitutional directive altering the balance of power among the three branches of government did not override the rationale for deference to the Executive branch in times of political trauma.@story_separate@Marcos justified martial law based on government inefficiency and ""an overblown allegation of communist threat."" 3 In truth, the trigger for the declaration of martial law did not involve a communist menace but constitutional limits on Marcos' presidency. With his opponents poised to take over the Presidency, Marcos set out to circumvent constitutional term limits. 4 He cultivated an atmosphere of fear-faking attacks on his officials and setting off explosions-to gain international support for authoritarian rule. 5 Marcos marketed martial law to the world by proclaiming his New Society, a set of ambitious promises of social and economic reform, coupled with some practical steps to curb general anarchy and violence. 6 Marcos declared martial law in September 1972 and replaced the Americaninspired and -approved (1935) Constitution with a parliamentary system. Marcos shut down Congress and restricted speech and other civil liberties. He did not touch the Supreme Court, to show critics that his actions would be subject to judicial review. Critics brought suits to challenge the constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the ratification of a new Constitution. The Supreme Court's ruling in Javellana v. Executive Secretary 7 held that the 1973 Constitution was already in effect. 8 The Supreme Court called the adoption of the Constitution a ""political question"" and it helped cement Marcos' strongman rule. Since then, the Supreme Court, throughout the martial law regime (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) , hardly voted against the Administration. Judicial review, if exercised at all, almost invariably upheld the acts of the President. The Supreme Court's docility, some suggest, was adopted as a way to survive. 9 Marcos was ousted by massive protests in 1986 after a tainted election that was intended to reboot his mandate. 10 The laws of emergency refer to measures triggered by urgent and unpredictable circumstances as well as to exceptional crises. In most legal systems, it is recognized as an institution of last resort in extreme, extraordinary cases, where a national, social, economic or political crisis fails to effectively address it. 11 Pottakis explains: …resorting to the law of emergency highlights the limits of democratic constitutional arrangements. Even if the appeal to the law of emergency does not automatically call for the suspension of basic constitutional provisions, notable rights protection, as is usually the case, it signifies a departure from normal, constitutionally prescribed democratic decision-making arrangements. Thus the law of emergency fits quite uneasily in modern regimes. 12 Emergency regimes are deemed necessary because when public safety is seriously threatened, there may be a need for quick and decisive action that cannot wait for the ordinary pace of constitutional rule. 13 This presents a dilemma of a liberal constitutional government: the rights and protections it provides and preserves can 7 [1973] 50 SCRA 1.

In: Tate CN, Vallinder T (ed) The global expansion of judicial power.

The rule of law is necessary in an emergency regime to ensure reasonable protection to the individuals on the one hand and to prevent abusive exercises of Executive powers on the other. In many jurisdictions, the task of protecting human rights and the rule of law during an emergency falls on an independent judiciary. 19 The question of judicial review arises in two types of cases: 1. whether there exists a public emergency threatening the life of the nation; 2. whether the measures taken are permissible in law to restore normalcy. 20 Courts are said to be well-suited for this function for three reasons: 1. They have the advantage of hindsight; 2. They take up issues relating to emergency powers ""not in the abstract … but in the context of specific cases""; and 3. 45 and Niger, 46 the constitutions require the involvement of courts in the declaration by means of mandatory consultations before such are decreed. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the constitutions of Chile, 47 Sierra Leone, 48 and Sri Lanka 49 expressly prohibit the courts from inquiring into the factual circumstances invoked by the authority to declare states of emergency. Courts often say, however, that national security matters fall outside their institutional expertise because the national security cases typically involve sensitive security intelligence information that governments are unwilling to furnish in open court. 50 This is what happened in the Philippines. The Philippines suffered heavily under Marcos' martial law regime. 51 The police engaged in systematic human rights abuses and syndicated gambling, drugs, or smuggling. 52 The regime is said to be responsible for 3,257 deaths, while an estimated 35,000 were tortured and 70,000 were arrested. 77 percent of those who died were tortured and killed with the remains dumped for display. 53 The Marcos estate was found liable to a class of 10,000 Filipinos and 23 plaintiffs for torture, summary execution, disappearance, and prolonged arbitrary detention. In 1994, the jury awarded $1.2 billion in exemplary damages. 54 The case involved five consolidated cases and was tried in a two-week period. Victims of torture and arbitrary detention testified about their individual trauma, and in some cases, to relate Marcos's personal involvement in their sufferings. 55 The Constitutional Commission of 1986 placed safeguards in the fundamental law to prevent similar abuses in the future. The Philippine Constitution has three separate provisions on emergencies. 56 The first of these is a delegation of legislative powers under Article VI, Section 23 of the Constitution. This provision delegates legislative powers to the President under certain circumstances. On its face, the President's exercise of emergency powers may seem like an improper exercise of legislative powers. Under the separation of powers doctrine, each department of the government has exclusive cognizance of matters placed within its jurisdiction, and is supreme within its own sphere. Thus, there is a corollary principle that the powers of these branches cannot be delegated to others: what has been delegated cannot be delegated. So while the President cannot legislate as a rule, she may do so under certain situations sanctioned by law. The nature of the delegation under the present Constitution is not as restricted as it was under the 1935 Constitution. The older Constitution merely delegated the power ""to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out a declared national policy."" 57 The language of the 1987 Constitutions supports the argument that the Congress may delegate legislative power, and not merely rule-making powers. 58 Still, the Constitution provides two restrictions on the delegated power. The first is that the power is temporary-the delegation automatically ends when Congress adjourns or when it is sooner withdrawn by Congress. The withdrawal is done by resolution, not by law. A Resolution of Congress does not require the President's approval. This would avoid a situation where the President might resist the withdrawal of his powers. Congress may also add restrictions on the powers although the Constitution has apparently left Congress with broad discretion on the nature or extent of these restrictions. The second emergency power falls under Article VII on the Executive Department, which lists the President's powers as Commander-in Chief: SECTION 18. The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law. Within forty-eight hours from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the President shall submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress. The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President. Upon the initiative of the President, the Congress may, in the same manner, extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress, if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it. The Congress, if not in session, shall, within twenty-four hours following such proclamation or suspension, convene in accordance with its rules without any need of a call. The Supreme Court may review, in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen, the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ or the extension thereof, and must promulgate its decision thereon within thirty days from its filing. A state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able to function, nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ. The suspension of the privilege of the writ shall apply only to persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in or directly connected with the invasion. During the suspension of the privilege of the writ, any person thus arrested or detained shall be judicially charged within three days, otherwise he shall be released. The third emergency power can be found under Article XII on the National Patrimony. Section 17 of the Article provides that: SECTION 17. In times of national emergency, when the public interest so requires, the State may, during the emergency and under reasonable terms prescribed by it, temporarily take over or direct the operation of any privately owned public utility or business affected with public interest. For our purposes, we focus on the commander-in-chief powers of the President and the Supreme Court's powers under Section 18 of Article VII. The length of the provision shows the painstaking efforts that were taken to plug the loopholes created by the Marcos Regime. The framers of the 1987 Constitution had a heated debate about congressional concurrence in the President's exercise of extraordinary emergency power. This was opposed largely on the argument that such limitation would hamper the President's ability to respond quickly to emergencies. The concurrence of Congress was dispensed with, but the President must, within 48 hours from taking emergency action, submit a report to Congress either in person or in writing. Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension."" The revocation will not be set aside by the President. 59 The Constitution now grants the President, as Commander-in-Chief, a ""sequence"" of graduated powers, which are: the calling out power, the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the power to declare martial law. In the exercise of the latter two powers, the Constitution requires the concurrence of an actual invasion or rebellion, and that public safety requires the exercise of such power. However, the ""calling out power"" can be exercised ""whenever it becomes necessary."" 60 Pangalangan summarizes the Commander-in-Chief's emergency powers under the 1987 Constitution: Due to the nightmare of one-man rule, the post-Marcos constitution confined the extraordinary powers of the chief executive through institutional checks. It recognized three situations of ""national security"" emergencies and a fourth situation of economic emergency, all of them subject to Congressional or judicial oversight. The three ""commander-in-chief"" powers are listed in succeeding gradations of severity: the power to ""call out the armed forces,"" suspend the writ of habeas corpus and thus authorize warrantless arrests, or proclaim martial law. Significantly, the habeas corpus and martial-law powers are subject to automatic constraints. Congress may automatically review these declarations within fixed time periods ""without need of a call."" The Supreme Court may be called on by any citizen to exercise its power of judicial review, thus dispensing with the actual injury requirement for judicial standing. Finally, for emergencies of an economic nature, the state may ""temporarily take over or direct the operation of any privately-owned public utility or business affected with public interest."" 61 Joaquin Bernas, a member of the commission that drafted the Constitution, explains that any citizen is given standing to bring appropriate action to challenge the action taken by the President. ""This can be done even before Congress acts, and the decision of the Supreme Court would also bind Congress. But since the object of the Supreme Court's action would be the verification of 'the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege,' necessarily the Supreme Court's evaluation would be transitory if proven wrong by subsequent changes in the factual situation."" 62 There is a long line of cases that demonstrated how the Supreme Court checked the President's power during emergencies. 59 Ibid., 917-8. 60 Sanlakas v. Reyes [2004] 466 PHIL 482. 61 Pangalangan RC (2016) Philippine constitutional law: majoritarian courts and elite politics.

The Court's decisions were inconsistent and the indecisiveness of the Court revolved around the definition of ""political questions."" Initially deferring to the President, the Court held that ""the President and his decision is final and conclusive on the courts."" In Lansang v. Garcia and subsequent cases, the Court took the opposite view and held that the Supreme Court has the authority to inquire into the existence of factual bases in order to determine their constitutional sufficiency. The Court shifted the focus to the system of checks and balances, ""under which the President is supreme, . . . only if and when he acts within the sphere allotted to him by the Basic Law, and the authority to determine whether or not he has so acted is vested in the Judicial Department…"" The Court would later give the President the sole power to declare the existence of emergencies: In 1973, the unanimous Court of Lansang was divided in Aquino v. Enrile. There, the Court was almost evenly divided on the issue of whether the validity of the imposition of Martial Law is a political or justiciable question. Then came Garcia-Padilla v. Enrile which greatly diluted Lansang. It declared that there is a need to re-examine the latter case, ratiocinating that ""in times of war or national emergency, the President must be given absolute control for the very life of the nation and the government is in great peril. The President, it intoned, is answerable only to his conscience, the People, and God."" 63 Marcos was given all the power to define and deal with emergencies and for many years, he governed with an iron hand unchecked. 64 The 1987 Constitution's provisions on emergencies have been frequently tested. Emergencies of every kind have visited the Philippines from a spike in crimes to politically motivated mass murders. The Supreme Court, as I will presently show, has not been quick to assume its new role but has elected to perform a secondary role. President Joseph Estrada, invoking his powers as Commander-in-Chief, addressed a memorandum to the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP) directing them to deploy and Marines to assist the Philippine National Police in preventing criminal or lawless violence through visibility patrols in the metropolis. The Integrated Bar of the Philippines filed a petition to annul Letter of Instruction 02/2000 and to declare such deployment of the Marines null and void and unconstitutional. The Supreme Court determined whether the President's factual determination of the necessity of calling the armed forces is subject to judicial review. According to the Court, when the President calls the armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion, he necessarily exercises a discretionary power solely vested in his wisdom. Saying it was clear from the intent of the framers and from the text of the Constitution itself, it added that the Court cannot be called upon to overrule the President's wisdom. The Court added, however, that this does not prevent an examination of whether such power was exercised within permissible constitutional limits or whether it was exercised in a manner constituting grave abuse of discretion. In view of the constitutional intent to give the President full discretionary power to determine the necessity of calling out the armed forces, it is incumbent upon the petitioner to show that the President's decision is totally bereft of factual basis. 65 The next four cases involved President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's propensity to declare a states of emergencies. In every case, her proclamation was challenged as an attempt to exercise emergency powers without triggering the constitutional safeguards available when the President declares martial law. In every case, however, the Supreme Court simply classified her acts under the ""calling out power,"" the most benign of her powers as Commander-in Chief, despite the fact warrantless arrests were being carried out. The first case involved an uprising that followed the arrest of former President Joseph Estrada so he could be tried for the crime of plunder. Estrada's followers erupted in protest. On May 1, 2001, President Macapagal-Arroyo, faced by an ""angry and violent mob armed with explosives, firearms, bladed weapons, clubs, stones and other deadly weapons"" assaulting and attempting to break into Malacañang, issued Proclamation No. 38 declaring that there was a state of rebellion in the National Capital Region. She likewise issued General Order No. 1, directing the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to suppress the rebellion in the National Capital Region. Warrantless arrests of several alleged leaders and promoters of the ""rebellion"" were thereafter effected. 66 All the petitions in this case assailed the declaration of a state of rebellion by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and the warrantless arrests that were allegedly being carried out. However, on May 6, 2001, President Macapagal-Arroyo ordered the lifting of the declaration of a ""state of rebellion"" in Metro Manila. Accordingly, the petitions were rendered moot and academic. The Court then addressed the claim that the proclamation of a ""state of rebellion"" was used by the authorities to justify warrantless arrests. The Court said, however, that the Secretary of Justice denied that it had issued a particular order to arrest specific persons in connection with the ""rebellion."" 67 The Court did say that in suppressing the rebellion, the authorities may only resort to warrantless arrests of persons suspected of rebellion, as provided under Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules of Court, if the circumstances so warrant. The warrantless arrest feared by petitioners is, thus, not based on the declaration of a ""state of rebellion."" In 2003 The Supreme Court sided with the President. It held that the President has full discretionary power to call out the armed forces and to determine the necessity for the exercise of such power. While the Court may examine whether the power was exercised within constitutional limits or in a manner constituting grave abuse of discretion, none of the petitioners here had, by way of proof, supported their assertion that the President acted without factual basis. The Court simply said that in calling out the armed forces, a declaration of a state of rebellion is ""an utter superfluity"" and At most, it only gives notice to the nation that such a state exists and that the armed forces may be called to prevent or suppress it. Perhaps the declaration may wreak emotional effects upon the perceived enemies of the State, even on the entire nation. But this Court's mandate is to probe only into the legal consequences of the declaration. This Court finds that such a 67 Ibid. 68 More than 300 junior officers and enlisted men took over the Oakwood Premier in the Ayala Center, Makati City on July 27, 2003. They were led by Navy Ltsg. Antonio Trillanes IV, Army Capt. Gerardo Gambala, Army Capt. Milo Maestrecampo, Navy Ltsg. James Layug and Marine Capt. Gary Alejano. The soldiers claimed that they simply intended to air their grievances against the government, including graft and corruption in the military. See (2008) Oakwood mutiny backgrounder.

For all legal intents, the declaration is deemed not written. 69 The petitioners argued that the President's declaration of a ""state of rebellion"" was a means of imposing martial law without triggering the constitutional safeguards for the exercise of those powers. The Court disagreed and said that the argument ""is a leap of logic."" Said the Court: There is no indication that military tribunals have replaced civil courts in the ""theater of war"" or that military authorities have taken over the functions of civil government. According to the Court, ""There is no allegation of curtailment of civil or political rights. There is no indication that the President has exercised judicial and legislative powers. In short, there is no illustration that the President has attempted to exercise or has exercised martial law powers."" 70 One dissent saw beyond the President's ruse:  Seven petitions alleged that President Arroyo committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing Presidential Proclamation No. 1017 and General Order No. 5. The President declared a state of national emergency in Proclamation No. 1017 citing a conspiracy among members of the military, of the New Peoples Army, and of the political opposition to unseat or assassinate her. Telecommunication towers and cell sites were bombed, an army outpost was raided, the New Peoples' Army and the National Democratic Front publicly warned of the President's ouster, and information regarding plots within the military were exposed. She issued General Order No. 5 and called upon the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to carry out the necessary and appropriate actions and measures to suppress and prevent acts of terrorism and lawless violence. Proclamation No. 1017 was lifted exactly a week after it was issued, but before all the petitions had been filed. One of the issues raised in the case was whether the Supreme Court can review the factual bases of Proclamation No. 1017. Petitioners argued that Proclamation No. 69 Sanlakas v. Reyes [2004] 1017 had no factual basis. Hence, it was not necessary for President Arroyo to issue such Proclamation. The Supreme Court explained the history of the Court's power to review the factual bases of the President's exercise of his Commander-in-Chief powers. The Court pointed out that early decisions declared that the authority to decide whether an exigency has arisen belongs to the President and his decision is final and conclusive on the courts. In Lansang v. Garcia, 72 the Court unanimously held that it has the authority to inquire into the existence of factual bases in order to determine the constitutionality of a declaration of an emergency. 73 Lansang was eventually reversed with the Court ruling that ""in times of war or national emergency, the President must be given absolute control for the very life of the nation and the government is in great peril. The President, it said, is answerable only to his conscience, the People, and God."" Some of the petitioners maintained that Proclamation No. 1017 is actually a declaration of martial law. The Court disagreed. It explained that what the President invoked was her calling-out power. It held that the petitioners failed to show that President Arroyo's exercise of the calling-out power was totally bereft of factual basis. In the end, the Court held that the proclamation was a valid act under Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution and the relevant jurisprudence discussed earlier. However, the Proclamation's provisions giving the President express or implied power (1) to issue decrees; (2) to direct the AFP to enforce obedience to all laws even those not related to lawless violence as well as decrees promulgated by the President; and (3) to impose standards on media or any form of prior restraint on the press, are ultra vires and unconstitutional. The Court also ruled that under Section 17, 72 In re Lansang v. Garcia [1971] 149 PHIL 547. 73 There the Court held: Indeed, the grant of power to suspend the privilege is neither absolute nor unqualified. The authority conferred by the Constitution, both under the Bill of Rights and under the Executive Department, is limited and conditional. The precept in the Bill of Rights establishes a general rule, as well as an exception thereto. What is more, it postulates the former in the negative, evidently to stress its importance, by providing that ""(t)he privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended . . . ."" It is only by way of exception that it permits the suspension of the privilege ""in cases of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion""-or, under Article VII of the Constitution, ""imminent danger thereof""-""when the public safety requires it, in any of which events the same may be suspended wherever during such period the necessity for such suspension shall exist."" For from being full and plenary, the authority to suspend the privilege of the writ is thus circumscribed, confined and restricted, not only by the prescribed setting or the conditions essential to its existence, but, also, as regards the time when and the place where it may be exercised. These factors and the aforementioned setting or conditions mark, establish and define the extent, the confines and the limits of said power, beyond which it does not exist. And, like the limitations and restrictions imposed by the Fundamental Law upon the legislative department, adherence thereto and compliance therewith may, within proper bounds, be inquired into by courts of justice. Otherwise, the explicit constitutional provisions thereon would be meaningless. Surely, the framers of our Constitution could not have intended to engage in such a wasteful exercise in futility. Article XII of the Constitution, the President, in the absence of a law, cannot take over privately-owned public utility and private business affected with public interest. 74 4.5 Ampatuan v. Puno, G.R. No. 190259, June 7, 2011 In response to the Maguindanao massacre, 75 President Arroyo issued Proclamation No. 1946, placing Maguindanao, Sultan Kudarat, and Cotabato under a state of emergency. She directed the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to undertake such measures as may be allowed by the Constitution and by law to prevent and suppress all incidents of lawless violence. She also issued Administrative Order 273-A, delegating supervision of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao to the Department of Interior and Local Government. The petitioners filed a case questioning the existence of a factual basis for such declaration and assailing the delegation for violating the principle of local autonomy and constituting an invalid exercise of the President's emergency powers. Petitioners argued that the President unlawfully exercised emergency powers when she ordered the deployment of AFP and PNP personnel in the places mentioned in the proclamation. Again the Court sided with the President and held that she did not proclaim a national emergency, only a state of emergency in the three places mentioned. The calling out of the armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence in such places is a power that the Constitution directly vests in the President. She did not need a congressional authority to exercise the same. Again the Supreme Court held that the President's call for the armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence springs from her ""calling out power."" The Court emphasized its limited powers when asked to inquire into the factual bases for the President's exercise of the ""calling out power""; the Court would generally defer to the President's judgment on the matter. Citing Integrated Bar of the Philippines v. Zamora, the Court held that unless it is shown that such determination was attended by grave abuse of discretion, the Court will accord respect to the President's judgment. 76 74 David v. Macapagal-Arroyo [2006] 522 PHIL 705. 75 In November 2009, a convoy of politicians and their supporters, journalists and lawyers were shot and hacked to death by armed men believed to be working for the Ampatuans, a political dynasty that controls the province. The victims were on their way to file certificates of candidacy to challenge the Ampatuans' governorship which had always been unchallenged. See Conde C (2009) The making of a massacre in the Philippines. New York Times. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/ 11/world/asia/11iht-massacre.html. Accessed 18 June 2016. 76 Ampatuan v. Puno [2011] 666 PHIL 225. Still in response to the Maguindanao massacre, President Arroyo issued Presidential Proclamation No. 1959 declaring martial law and suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in the province of Maguindanao except for identified areas of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Two days later, she submitted a report to Congress as required by Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution. Before Congress could act, the President already lifted martial law and restored the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in Maguindanao. The petitions were filed to challenge the constitutionality of Proclamation No. 1959. The Court explained that the President and Congress share the power to proclaim martial law or suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus: 1. The President's proclamation or suspension is temporary, good for only 60 days; 2. He must, within 48 hours of the proclamation or suspension, report his action in person or in writing to Congress; 3. Both houses of Congress, if not in session must jointly convene within 24 hours of the proclamation or suspension for the purpose of reviewing its validity; and 4. The Congress, voting jointly, may revoke or affirm the President's proclamation or suspension, allow their limited effectivity to lapse, or extend the same if Congress deems warranted. Under the 1987 Constitution the President and the Congress act in tandem in exercising the power to proclaim martial law or suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. They exercise the power jointly, because after the President initiates the proclamation or the suspension, only Congress can maintain the same based on its own evaluation of the situation on the ground, a power that the President does not have. The Court, however, made a stunning interpretation of its powers under the Constitution: Consequently, although the Constitution reserves to the Supreme Court the power to review the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation or suspension in a proper suit, it is implicit that the Court must allow Congress to exercise its own review powers, which is automatic rather than initiated. Only when Congress defaults in its express duty to defend the Constitution through such review should the Supreme Court step in as its final rampart. The constitutional validity of the President's proclamation of martial law or suspension of the writ of habeas corpus is first a political question in the hands of Congress before it becomes a justiciable one in the hands of the Court… If the Congress procrastinates or altogether fails to fulfill its duty respecting the proclamation or suspension within the short time expected of it, then the Court can step in, hear the petitions challenging the President's action, and ascertain if it has a factual basis. If the Court finds none, then it can annul the proclamation or the suspension. 77 There is nothing in the text of the Constitution that justifies this interpretation. The purpose of the provision being to check Executive abuse, the Court should have interpreted the Constitution as a way of providing multiple and simultaneous avenues for redress. Under this interpretation, when one branch of government (Congress or the Supreme Court) makes a determination as to the factual basis of the emergency, then that decision should bind the other. As explained earlier, the framers of the Constitution supports the view that the judicial remedy ""can be done even before Congress acts, and the decision of the Supreme Court would also bind Congress."" 78 It is also difficult to determine when Congress ""procrastinates"" or ""fails to fulfill its duty."" If discussions drag on, would it be time for the Court to step in? The Constitution merely directs Congress to convene within twenty-four hours but it does not provide a period of time within which to make its decision. The Philippine experience reflects the two schools of thought that dominates the discourse on the extent of judicial review of actions arising from political trauma. There are two main views about the proper role of the Constitution during national emergencies: the ""accommodation"" view and the ""strict enforcement"" view. Under the accommodation view, the Constitution should be relaxed or suspended during an emergency. An emergency requires the concentration of power and that constitutional rights be relaxed, so that the Executive can move forcefully against the threat. Constitutional norms can be relaxed during emergencies so that the risks to civil liberties inherent in expansive Executive power-the misuse of the power for political gain-are justified by the national security benefits. 79 Under the strict enforcement view, constitutional rules are not, and should not be relaxed during an emergency. This view observes that the Constitution already provides that the level of protection for civil liberties depends on the interest of the government. Consider, for example, ""compelling interest"" standards used to evaluate laws that discriminate against protected classes. When an emergency exists, the government has a ""compelling interest"" in responding to it in a vigorous and effective way. Thus, laws that would not be tolerated during normal times are constitutionally permissible during emergencies. The Constitution should be enforced ""strictly""that is, the rules should be the same during emergencies as during normal times, even if outcomes differ, so that both civil liberties and government interests such as national security can be appropriately balanced, as they always need to be. 80 As the Philippine Supreme Court demonstrated during the Marcos regime, courts often defer to the exercise of enumerated, implied, and inherent powers by the other branches. The Court legitimated many extra-constitutional political constructions 78 Bernas JG (2009) that reshaped the administration of public power by the other branches. 81 The judiciary, in times of emergency and alleged emergency, usually defer to Executive claims. Infamous wartime cases such as Korematsu 82 ""were regarded as badges of shame."" But it also seemed that judges reverted to deference when national security concerns were alleged by the Executive, even outside of the context of wartime emergency. 83 Those who support judicial deference claim that courts are ill-equipped to assess the Executive's intelligence and security calculations, which often must be made rapidly and which carry important foreign policy implications. Under this view, the Executive is more accountable to the public than courts, such that its decisions will be guided and tempered by the public will. Those who seek judicial intervention say the Executive has undue incentives to emphasize security values over liberty values, and only a vigorous judicial role can counter that. They view robust judicial deference to the Executive as weakening a critical tool by which to inhibit a single branch of government from accruing undue power. 84 In most cases, courts use abstention doctrines and other tools to decline such cases on the merits. When courts do hear these cases, they often issue decisions that are highly deferential to Executive choices. 85 Despite the breadth of judicial power in the Philippines, the courts do not wield it freely. Judicial review involves ""the delicate exercise of examining the validity or constitutionality of an act of a coequal branch of government"" 86 and the Supreme Court ""must continually exercise restraint to avoid the risk of supplanting the wisdom of the constitutionally appointed actor with that of its own."" 87 In another case, the Supreme Court explained that the doctrine of separation of powers which imposes upon the courts proper restraint in striking down the acts of the Executive or the Legislature as unconstitutional. 88 The Court's function of review is limited: the Court may pass upon the constitutionality of acts of the Legislative and the Executive branches, since its duty is not to review their collective wisdom but, rather, to make sure that they have acted in consonance with their respective authorities and rights as mandated of them by the Constitution. If the Court finds no constitutional violations of any sort, then it has no more authority to proscribe the actions under review. 89 81 Brisbin RA Jr (2005) There is also pressure on courts to defer to Executive actors: judges deciding constitutional claims during times of emergency ""should defer to government action so long as there is any rational basis for the government's position, which in effect means that the judges should almost always defer, as in fact they have when emergencies are in full flower."" 90 Courts suffer from institutional disadvantages in resolving certain types of disputes. Courts defer to the Executive branch, for example, when dealing with foreign affairs controversies, including controversies regarding the allocation of foreign affairs powers. 91 The cases present a Court that is unwilling to assume its new role as a check on the exercise of emergency powers. Integrated Bar of the Philippines imposed a near-impossible standard to check the President's power to call out the military: that the President's decision is ""totally bereft of factual basis."" President Arroyo dealt with many emergencies but succeeded in evading constitutional checks by using several techniques. Pangalangan explained: The first is by pre-emption, that is to say, by mooting the case and forestalling judicial review through the expedient of lifting the emergency before the case is decided….Arroyo 'deviat[es] from the concise and plain' text of the Constitution, avoids the Constitution's 'graduated' levels of powers and checks, and simply calls her emergency powers by another name. The Constitution sets out the gradations: 'calling out', suspending the writ and proclaiming martial law. Arroyo instead used the terms 'state of rebellion ' (in 2001 and 2003) and 'state of national emergency ' (in 2006) . And why persist in what the court validated at best as a suspect legal superfluity? Because to use the exact text of the Constitution would have triggered the institutional safeguards. Change the labels, escape the checks. The third is by what I call 'doing without naming'. Arroyo sought to achieve her political aims without resorting to legal measures, or by simply applying the generic, non-emergency-related provisions of the criminal code. 92 The Supreme Court, with few dissents, did not censure her. Since the President's words did not trigger the Constitutional safeguards, there were no acts to strike down. By the time Fortun was decided, the Court had excused itself from its duties, assigning the primary task of checking abuse to Congress. There is an inconsistency between the traditional role of the Court in constitutional litigation and its new role as a super-constitutional check against Executive abuse. The Court's textbook explanation of its role is clear: its duty is to steer clear of declaring unconstitutional the acts of the Executive or the Legislative department, given the assumption that it carefully studied those acts and found them consistent with the fundamental law before taking them. 93 Recall that until the 1987 Constitution came along, the Supreme Court has pretty much deferred to the Executive on matters involving national security. The Constitution today, however, is directing the Court to determine abuse of discretion on the part of the Executive, depriving the Court of the opportunity to rule on the extent of its powers. Courts, Ginsburg wrote, play games of power in legal arenas: Courts can challenge others or can seek powerful allies. They can cautiously accumulate policy gains in an incremental fashion or boldly battle for large pieces of territory. They can choose their battles carefully, limiting conflicts to those they can win and thus making future threats credible; or they can blunder badly and provoke crippling counterattacks. 94 While courts are almost universally granted the power to exercise judicial review, they differ in the extent to which they are willing to exercise this power. 95 The extent of judicialization is determined by ""the configuration of political forces and the receptiveness of courts to accepting controversial disputes."" 96 Ginsburg's insights are helpful here: ""Constitutional courts are institutionally cautious; yet through careful decision making they can entrench the constitutional system by inducing actors to remain in the constitutional order and comply with seemingly adverse decisions…. Where courts become bold, they may generate a backlash that actually reduces their freedom of action. 97 In a field as volatile as public emergencies, the Philippine Supreme Court crafted a more conservative role for itself. Constitutionally empowered to check the Chief Executive, the Supreme Court may yet be wondering what it has to gain by defying Executive findings that the public is in danger.@story_separate@The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines was designed to prevent a repetition of the excesses of the Marcos dictatorship. The Constitution expressly empowered the Supreme Court with the power to review the exercise of emergency powers. The Court, however, seems disinterested in assuming its new role. It has imposed a nearimpossible standard for litigants in striking down Executive acts, or stepped aside instead of stepping up to exercise its new powers. The 1987 Constitution has removed the Philippine case from the debates around the extent of judicial review over Executive emergency actions. The Court has the power to determine whether there was in fact an abuse of this power. The Supreme Court has opted to act politically, by inoculating itself from the politics inherent in the nature of public emergencies and allowing other layers of political vetoes to come into play. 94 Ginsburg T (2003)","The Philippine Supreme Court aided Ferdinand Marcos by laying the legal scaffolding for his martial law regime. The Court refused to check the President’s power by deferring to the Executive Branch in case of emergencies. When Marcos was ousted in 1986, Filipinos adopted a Constitution that gave the Judiciary the power to review the factual bases of emergency actions. The Supreme Court, however, refuses to use this power. The Court refuses to check the President because of institutional competence constraints, believing that the only issues that can be resolved by the judiciary are those that can be done on the basis of reasoned argument. When courts go beyond this role, they endanger their legitimacy as legal institutions because they act beyond their area of competence. The Philippine case shows that a constitutional directive that empowers the judiciary did not override deference to the executive branch in times of political trauma. As a result of this deference the Supreme Court has dismantled the safeguards in the post-Marcos constitution."
"1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition reactions play a key role in organic chemistry [1] . They are routes for the synthesis of a considerable diversity of functionalized five-membered heterocyclic systems, which present a perfect compounds of ""non heterocyclic"" derivatives [2] . The effect of the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions in domain of heterocyclic synthesis is comparable to that of Diels-Alder reactions on synthesis of carbocyclic products [3] [4] . In fact, the abundance of various classes of dipoles and dipolarophiles offer a lot of perspectives. Indeed, the dipolar cycloaddition reactions serve as main key in the total synthesis of natural products or analogues [5] . 1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition is a main synthesis strategy to the regio-and stereoselective of five membered heterocycles and their ring opened acyclic derivatives, more than that, it serves as a chemical test [6] . Indeed, the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of Diazomethane (DZM) leading to pyrazolines, was used to test the presence of an exocyclic methylene α, β-unsaturated-γ-lactone functionnality [7] . Large experimental and theoretical studies focused at understanding the reaction mechanism and the origin of the observed chemo-, regio-and stereo-selectivity observed in many reactions. The earlier work of Huisgen and coworkers revealed that the mechanism of 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions which lead to 5-membered rings are managed by the stereoselectivity of dipolarophiles, the nature of solvent and substituents, the activation parameters, and by orientation phenomena [8] [9] [10] . Whereas Houk et al. [11] [12] explain that the frontier orbital energies and coefficients allow a specific qualitative treatment of reactivity of individual 1,3 dipoles. Recently, molecular electronic density theory (MEDT) accompagnied with the IGM and ELF analysis have been invested with a great success to reveal the mechanism of many reactions [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In the present work, we have used the MEDT, IGM and ELF tools to study the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction between Diazomethane (DZM) and Psilostachyin (PSH). This reaction has been realized by the Adriana Ortiz-León group [7] in ether solution, leading to mexicanin I acetate pyrazoline product (Scheme 1). However, to date, the stereochemistry of this reaction has not been explained nor a mechanism associated with the previous reaction had been elaborated. The DZM, known as a 1,3-dipole of the propargyl/allenyl anion type presents an electron donating capacity of the Catom with double Carbone-Carbon bonds in dipolarophile, involving its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).@story_separate@with the PSH reagent. Theoretically, there are eight possibilities for the C-atom of DZM to add up at the double Carbone-Carbon bonds of PSH reagent (addition of C(sp2) of DZM at C4, C5, C6 or C7). So, this interaction leads a priori to eight products: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7 and P8 (Scheme 2). This reaction evolves through the pathways specified, where eight transition states (TS1, TS2, TS3, TS4, TS5, TS6, TS7 and TS8) are involved. So, our goal in this work is to investigate the different possibilities of addition between the two reagents, to detect the different transition structures, to predict the more favored channel of addition, in order to reveal the mechanism of reaction with a good electronic density description. The different possibilities of addition of Diazomethane to carbon-carbon double bonds of PSH reagent leading to eight possible products The obtained products P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7 and P8 belong to a large family of pyrazoline derivatives (pseudoguaianolide pyrazolines). These compounds are an important biological agents and many studies in literature have been focused on this class, due to their relevant biological properties, that include antiviral, antibacterial, antitumor, anti-tubercular, antifungal, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anaesthetic, analgesic and insecticidal agents [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Considering the large anti-viral properties of pyrazoline products [28] [29] [30] [31] , they deserve to be tested against COVID-19, seen till this date, there is no vaccine and no antiviral for the treatment of this virus [32] [33] . The appearance of new structural data of key proteins associated with SARSCoV-2 and the host, such as the main protease (M pro ) [34] , the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [35] , human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) [36] and spike glycoprotein (S) [37] , make the operation of search of the drug against COVID-19 from the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the protein targets and to identify small molecules that exhibit the desired chemical characteristics wanted to bind to the proteins targeted by molecular docking. This should be promising [38] [39] [40] . In this context, The last part of this work aims to investigated about the potential of inhibition of some derivatives of the family of pyrazoline products against COVID-19, by performing a molecular docking calculations. In this paper, we have focused on J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f main protease protein (M pro ) who intervenes at viral replication and transcription, as key to inhibit this virus [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Indeed, the M pro possesses an important role in cutting down polyproteins into functional pieces. Thus, we have targeted this protein in the docking calculations in order to check the ability of our pyrazoline products to inhibit the activity of M pro which could block the replication of the SARS-COV virus. The Density functional theory (DFT) has become a useful tool with a notable successes in most branches of chemistry [47] [48] [49] . Indeed, many theoretical works on chemical reactivity have adopted this theory for their calculations to providing theoretical insights for chemo-, regio-and stereo-selectivity. In this work, we have performed our DFT calculations by using the GAUSSIAN 09 [50] set of programs along with the graphical interface GaussView-5.0. Geometry optimization of different stationary points were performed at DFT/B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level and visualized by CYLview program [51] . Calculations of frequencies have been performed at 298.15°K and 1.0 atm, in order to verify that the transition structures (TSs) possess one imaginary frequency and that the minima have no imaginary frequency [52] . The energy profiles have been developed by the IRC calculation. The electronic structures of stationary points and the Wiberg bond indices [53] were analyzed through the natural bond orbital (NBO) method [54] . The solvent effects of ether were considered using a self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) based on the polarizable continuum model (PCM) of Thomasi [55] . The local and global reactivity have been analyzed through the Parr function using population analysis (NPA) [56] . The reactivity of molecular systems has been unveiled through several concepts [13] , [57] , [58] the electronic chemical potential μ, the chemical hardness η, the global electrophilicity ω and global nucleophilicity N. The previous global indices in the framework of the conceptual Density Functional Theory, are calculated by the next expressions, μ = (ε HOMO +ε LUMO )/2 , η = ε LUMO -ε HOMO and ω = μ 2 /2 η. The global nucleophilicity N, is calculated referring to tetracyanoethylene, N = E HOMO (nucleophile) -E HOMO (TCE). The local indices ω k , N k at atomic site K are obtained using Parr functions, respectively P + (r) and P -(r), as follows ω k = ωP + (r) and N k = NP -(r). P + (r) = ρ s ra (r) and P -(r) = ρ s rc (r). ρ s rc (r) and ρ s ra (r) are respectively the atomic spin density (ASD) of the radical cation and anion. According to Hohenberg-Kohn [59] , the total molecular information is in the electron density (ED) and the models based on the ED are more physically significant for chemical bonding analysis. Indeed, the independent gradient model approach (IGM) [60] , is more efficient to evaluate the evolution of the formation of new bonds. The IGM is more qualified for description of the covalent bonding pattern and revealing the weak interactions where other tools were obviously failing. It offers direct 3-D depiction in the form of closed domains associated with the spatial localization of the interactions. This is done through the mono determinantal wave functions of the ground state (GS) and that of the transition structures calculated at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level, using the Multiwfn software and visualized by the VMD program [61] . The physical descriptor associated with IGM [60] is symbolized by δg, δg=|∇ρ IGM |-|∇ρ|. ρ represents the electron density (it's a local function), and is an experimentally accessible scalarfield, |∇ρ IGM | represents the virtual upper limit of the electron density gradient and |∇ρ| represents a non-interacting system electron density gradient. δg is a measure of the ED gradient collapse caused by electron sharing between contra gradient ED sources present in the chemical system. The ELF calculation [56] , [62] , [63] has been adopted, in order to realize a good description of the electronic structures of our molecular systems and reveal the mechanism of the favored addition along the IRC path. The ELF analysis had a great success in literature. It's defined as follow, and D 0 (r) = (3 ) ( ) . The D(r) reveals the excess kinetic energy density caused by Pauli repulsion. The D 0 (r) can be interpreted as Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy density, which is the exact kinetic energy density of non-interacting, uniform electron gas. Hence D 0 (r) is introduced as a reference. A large ELF value means that electrons are greatly localized, indicating that there is a covalent bond, a lone pair or inner shells of the atom involved. Finally, we have used the noncovalent interaction (NCI) method [64] , which is also known as reduced density gradient (RDG) method. It will be very helpful to reveal the most favored addition channel, by analyzing the weak interactions in different TSs. ∇ρ(r) (non-interacting system electron density gradient). The region where the electron density is small, reveals the presence of weak interaction region [65] . Concerning the docking part, the biological activity of our compounds has been evaluated by using Maestro software (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2018) [66], Against Main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV2 (DOI: 10.2210/pdb6LU7/pdb) [66] which is a potential target of COVID-19 disease. Our compounds were initially docked to the binding site Main protease receptor using Glide SP (Schrödinger Suite 2018) [66] with standard settings. The procedure was composed of the preparation of the ligand and receptor, grid generation, and docking. The binding pocket of the proteins was predicted as to be the nearest space with distance less than 3 Å from ligand crystallized in the Main protease (N3). Concerning the preparation of the ligand in the Schrodinger software, we have used the LigPrep [66] to optimize the geometry of ligand and offer its three dimensional structure with correct chiralities. The LigPrep can also produce a number of structures from each input structure with various ionization states, tautomers, stereochemistry, and ring conformations. The presentation of the results concerning the reactivity study will be structured as follows. We start byan analysis of the conceptual DFT (CDFT) reactivity indices [67] and a topological analysis of ELF. Secondly, we present a mechanistic study for the eight competitive reaction paths associated with the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between DZM and PSH (Scheme 2). In the next we will be focused on analysis of the asynchronicity of the formation of the new sigma bonds using Wiberg bond order and IGM analysis [13] . Then, we show the ELF topological analysis along the IRC path associated with the favored product. This allows an accurate description for the mechanism of our reaction. Finally, we mention an analysis of non conventional interactions (NCI) in the different TSs associated with the addition of DZM at the C4=C5 double bond area, which will be very helpful to reveal the most favored path for addition by analyzing the weak interactions. To investigate the local atomic properties of reagents we will start by CDFT reactivity indices. Thus, the global reactivity indices defined via the CDFT are a useful theoretical tool to explain the reactivity in cycloaddition reactions [67] [68] . In table 1 are displayed the global properties of the different reagents, the values of the electronic chemical potential, μ, the chemical hardness, η, electrophilicity, ω, and nucleophilicity, N, for the different reagents. Table 1 . HOMO, LUMO energies (eV), electronic chemical potential (µ,eV), chemical hardness (η,eV), global electrophilicity (ω,eV) and global nucleophilicity (N,eV) at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) E HOMO (TCE) = -9.41 eV at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) As presented in Table 1 , the electronic chemical potential of DZM (-4.015eV) is higher than that of dipolarophile PSH (-4.635eV), consequently, the transfer of charge will be more favored from dipole to dipolarophile (NED: Normal Electronic Demand). The values of η for the two reagents confirm the previous results of μ, indeed the PSH (η=5.01 eV) is more hard to give electrons than DZM (η=4.65 eV). The electrophilicity ω scale, permits to classifying the organic compounds as strong electrophiles if ω > 1. 5 . Therefore, the values of (ω;Ν) related to the dipolarophile: PSH (2.14;2.27) and dipole DZM (1.73;3.07) indicate that the dipolarophile will act as a strong electrophile and for DZM will act as powerful nucleophile , in agreement with other previous parameters. When a nucleophile approaches an electrophile along a polar procedure, a specific electron density is moved from the nucleophile to the electrophilic species. As a result, the nucleophilic reagent loses a certain electronic density, while the electrophilic reagent gains this electronic density. These changes require a reorganization of the electronic density in two frames. In this case, the electrophilic and nucleophilic Parr functions have proved to be the most precise and insightful tools for studying the redistribution of electron density along polar processes, and are widely used to analyze localities in polar processes reactivity. The electrophilic Parr function of PSH and the nucleophilic Parr function of DZM are represented in Figure 1 . ; the most favorable regioisomeric channel will be linked with the two-center interaction between the most nucleophilic center in the DZM framework, the C1 carbon, and the most electrophilic center of electrophilic PSH C6 carbon, in disagreement with the experimental results and energetic analysis of the different competitive reaction paths. The failure of the Parr indices to predict the more favored zone of addition is explained by the fact that these indices are obtained from separated reagents without any consideration of energetic profile (TSs and products), and the interaction between the two reagents (steric effects and weak interactions). For these reasons we investigate in the next, the mechanistic factors beside the steric effects and the weak interactions associated with our reaction (NCI analysis). For more details and deep investigation about the local atomic properties of reagents we have realized a topological analysis of ELF and NPA of reagents. Thus, the quantum-chemical evaluation of ELF is an attractive procedure, that provides a simple link between the chemical structures and the distribution of electron density. To describe the simplest electronic structure of reagents, and determine their reactivity in 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions, a topological evaluation of the ELF was first carried out. The ELF basin attractor positions, ELF localization domains as well as the populations of the valence basin, together with the Lewis type structures proposed and the natural atomic charges are illustrated in Figure 2 . (Figure 2) . After realizing an investigation about the local atomic properties of reagents by CDFT and ELF analysis, we have investigated about the kinetic and thermodynamic factors which influence our reaction. Thus we have performed a mechanistic study of our reaction. Analysis of the mechanistic results in gas-phase indicates that the reaction between DZM and PSH occur along asynchronous concerted processes, therefore the different products (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7 and P8) and their corresponding TSs (TS1, TS2, TS3, TS4, TS5, TS6, TS7 and TS8) were obtained and verified. The total and relative energies are presented in table S1. The geometries of the different TSs are depicted in figure  S1 . The structure of the transition states are characterized by a vibrational frequency analysis. Indeed each transition state possess a single imaginary frequency. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f According to the relative energies values in gas-phase summarized in Table S1 , Scheme 3a and Scheme 3b, the activation barriers associated with the different possible products P1; P2; P3; P4; P5; P6; P7 and P8 are equals to 13,29; 13,77; 19,09 ; 24,18; 18,64; 18,61; 18,90 and 17 .92 (Kcal/mol) respectively. Consequently, the P1 product has the lowest value of the activation barrier. Kenetically, the P1 product is slightly favored than P2 product, but much more favored than the rest of products, in agreement with the experimental outcomes [7] . Thermodynamically, the most stable product is P2. The difference of stability between P2 (-27,12 Kcal/mol) and P1(-23.29 Kcal/mol) is equal to 3.93 kcal/mol. Hence, the studied reaction is controlled by the kinetic factors. To test the solvent effect in reaction, we have performed a total optimization of all stationary points in ether at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level by using the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) model based on the polarizable continuum model (PCM) of Tomasi [55] . All the results of energies are collected in table S1. The addition of ether causes an increase of activation barrier energy for the different products by 0.48 to 2.30 Kcal/mol. The difference between the activation barrier energies of TS1(13.77 Kcal/mol) and TS2(15.39 Kcal/mol) in ether, increase to 1.62 Kcal/mol, so the addition of ether is helpful for the formation of P1 product. The stability of the products in ether, decreases slightly by 0.124 to 1.67 Kcal/mol (Scheme 3). In summary, we can conclude that the addition of ether has a weak influence on the kinetic and thermodynamic factors, without any influence on chemo-, regio-and stereo-selectivity of reaction. Scheme 3a. The stereo-and regio-isomeric reaction paths associated with the addition of Diazomethane to carbon-carbon double bonds (C4=C5) of PSH. Reagent relative energies at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level, in gaz phase and in ether (in parentheses), are given in Kcal/mol relative to the separated reagents. The thermodynamic factors associated with the reaction of DZM with PSH in ether had been studied at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level by calculating the thermal enthalpy (H) and the thermal free energy (G). The different results of G and H have been mapped at Table S2 . The enthalpy profiles of the reaction paths associated with the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of Diazomethane to the PSH reagent, in ether at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) (Figure 3) , show that the P1 product need a lowest energy than other products. Indeed it need only 14.96 Kcal/mol as energy for activation and release a low energy of -18.98 Kcal/mol. Generally, all possibilities of reaction leading to different products P1; P2; P3; P4; P5; P6; P7 and P8 release energy in favor of the exterior, which shows that the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of Diazomethane to PSH reagentis exothermic. The energy released for different products varies from 16.99 Kcal/mol to 22.02 Kcal/mol. The optimized geometries of the TSs corresponding to the eights channels of reaction (Scheme 2) are reported in figure S1. The length of the new sigma bonds in evolution C1-C5 and N3-C4 at TS1 (lowest value of activation barrier) are 2.1223 Å and 2.5766 Å respectively. The degree of synchronicity (∆d, in Å) can be measured as the difference between the lengths of the two new sigma bonds in evolution. The value of ∆d between the C1-C5 and N3-C4 bonds in evolution of TS1 is equal to 0.4543 Å, indicating that the process of formation of the new sigma bonds in evolution occurs asynchronously. For TS2, the values of length of the new bonds in evolution are d(C1-C5) = 2.24399 Å and d(N3-C4) = 2.25172 Å, hence the formation of the two bonds is more or less synchronous. For more details about the degree of synchronicity ∆d for the rest of TSs, see Table  S3 . To confirm the previous results we use, in the next, the Wiberg bond indices and IGM analysis. The results of TVs allow us to collect useful information about the chemical process linked to the different transition structures detected in the studied reactions. The imaginary frequencies, the main TVs components and their corresponding geometric parameters for TSs are presented in Table 2 . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the Diels Alder cycloadditions (500 cm −1 ), indicating that these processes are associated with the motions of the heavy atoms and are also related to the earlier transition states. Beside the wiberg bond indices which have been computed by using the NBO population analysis, the novel IGM descriptor δg=|∇ρ IGM |-|∇ρ|, can be also invested as a real and an effective physical index, based on the electron density to obtain a deep analysis of the evolution of the cycloadducts process. The IGM analysis can be obtained by evaluating the electron density using the corresponding mono-determinantal wave functions of the ground state, corresponding to the TSs. The δg descriptor measures the interaction between atoms in the system, so we have focused on the atoms that will participate in the formation After detecting the different TSs and analyzing their geometries and frequencies, we have then elaborate the mechanism of our reaction. Hence the necessity to an ELF topological analysis along the IRC path associated with the favored product (P1). The ELF topological analysis of sorted structures along the IRC profile are listed in table S5. The most significant points of the IRC path were throughout analyzed and characterized, which lead to obtaining an important information concerning the mechanism of the reaction. The absence of an intermediate complex along IRC (Scheme S1), indicates that the formation of the new sigma bonds N3-C4 and C1-C5 takes place through a one-step molecular mechanism. Topological analysis of the ELF highlight that the formation of the N3-C4 and C1-C5 bonds is done in two stages and one-step. The ELF analysis reveals an interesting valence basins from S0 to S18 (see supplementary). The topological analysis of the ELF of the first structure of the IRC (S0), displays similar bonding pattern to those of the seperated reagents. Indeed, at S0 there are two important disynaptic basins V(C,C)=8 and V(C,C)=9 with a sum of electronic population equal to 3.45e, indicating that C4-C5 is a double bond, in front of this, we have two other disynaptic basins V(N,N)=3 and V(N-N)=4 integrating a total of population of 3.59e, which indicates a double bond between the two N atoms of DZM fragment. Furthermore, we have a disynaptic basin V(N,C)=5 between N atom and C atom of DZM integrating 3.09e which implied a pseudo double bond between the two previous atoms. Concerning the most important monosynaptic basins we have V(N)=1; V(N)=2; V(C)=6 and V(C)=7 which integrate 2.04e; 1.83e; 0.50e; 0.47e respectively. The values of V(N)=1; V(N)=2 indicate the existence of a lone pair and negative charge (-1.83e) on N atom. The change in basins is more remarkable at the structure S3, where we observe the disappearance of V(C)=6 and V(C)=7 basins and appearance of a novel basin V(C)=e with 0.72e, which increases to 1.49e at S6. In the same time the two disynaptic basins V(C-C)=8 and V(C-C)=9 disappear leading to a novel disynaptic basin V(C-C)=13 at S4 including 3.36e. At S11 we notice the formation of the novel C-C sigma bond (1.75e) which increases its electronic population to 1.85e at S18. Consequently the C-C bond is more advanced than the N-C sigma bond. The next novel sigma bond (N-C) begin to be formed at S15 by the appearance of monosynaptic basin V(C)=17 integrating 0.75e , which increases to 0.87e at S16, leading then to appearance of monosynaptic basin V(C)=14 and a disynaptic basin V(C-C)=18 at S17 integrating 1.58e as electronic population which increases to 1.71e at S18 leading to the formation of the second new sigma bond N3-C4. Analysis of charge transfer along the IRC path associated with the P1 product, indicates that it takes place from DMZ fragment to PSH fragment in conformity with the results of CDFT reactivity indices, so we confirm the NED character of the reaction. The values of global electronic density (table S5) transferred from DZM to PSH varied between 0.044e and 0.205e, which indicates the polar process of our reaction. As we have already reported the local indices have failed to predict the more favored zone of addition. This could been explained by the fact that these indices are obtained from separated reagents without any consideration of steric effects and weak interactions. For these reasons we have investigated about the steric effects and the weak interactions associated with our reaction by realizing a non covalent interactions analysis. Thus, the NCI index developed by Yang's group using quantum-mechanical electron density [69] is a visualization index, which allow an identification of non-covalent interactions (favorable and unfavorable interactions). It provides a rich representation of the weak interactions where other methods fail to describe them. The visualization for different intramolecular and intermolecular interactions (attractive and repulsive forces) is performed by coloration ( Figure 5) . The more blue implies the stronger attractive interaction, the interaction region marked by green can be identified as VdW interactions region and the regions marked by red, implied a zone of strong repulsion effect [58] . In our case, we have focused on the impact of the weak interactions on the regio-and stereo-selectivity at C4=C5 double bond area, so we have performed the NCI calculations with NCI plot [70] for the different TSs,TS1; TS2;TS3 and TS4 ( figure 6) . The visualization has been realized by the VMD program [61] . Herein, the 2D scatter graph and 3D RDG isosurface for the different TSs are represented in figure 6 and figure 7 . The RDG and sign (λ 2 )ρ are a pair of very important functions for revealing weak interaction regions, they are collectively employed in NCI method. The scatter plots of RDG versus the second largest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix of electron density functions are obtained by using Multiwfn 3.6 program [71] , based on the obtained wave functions calculated at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level and plotted using gnuplot program [72]. The figure 6 presented the different scatter graphs associated with the eight TSs. These scatter graphs, inform us about the type of dominant interactions by calculation of RDG in function with the sign(λ 2 )ρ. According to the obtained Scatter graphs, it exists tree type of interactions: strong attractions (blue area), Van Der Waals interactions (VdW) (green area) and strong repulsion (red area). The scatter graph of TS1 presents a large blue area (-0.05 a.u to -0.02 a.u), a narrow green area (-0.02 a.u to 0.01 a.u) and a red area (0.01 a.u to 0.05 a.u). Generaly, for the rest of scatter graphs associated with other TSs we remark that the green area expands slightly at the expense of blue area, furthermore the red area gets slightly bigger. The analysis of color-mapped RDG isosurfaces ( figure 7) show a strong attraction (blue color) of N and C atoms of DZM with the two C atoms (Double bond C=C) of PSH in different TSs. However, the addition approach associated withTS1 is more favored because the DZM fragment can get near the double bond easily without any other effects that can hinder it. On the other hand, for the rest of the TSs we can observe more VdW interactions (green color) which weaken the forces of addition on the double bond. So, the approach of DZM to the double bond of PSH in these cases is more difficult for the rest of the TSs. Consequently, the P1 pathway is more favored than the other products in conformity with the experimental outcomes [7] .  The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has spread rapidly around the world, the epidemiological characteristics of this virus allow it a high contagiousness risks. This invincible virus, causes enormous damage every day across the globe, and destabilize the human society and economy. As today, there is no vaccine and no antiviral for the treatment of this virus. However, some compounds can been promising for treatment, as pyrazoline molecules. So, we have tested some compounds of pyrazoline family (Table 3) with the Main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV2 which is an essential protein for the proteolytic maturation of the virus. Indeed, it has been examined as a potential target protein to prevent the spread of infection by inhibiting the cleavage of the viral polyprotein [73].  Molecular docking study is a helpful cheminformatics tool [41] [42] [43] that gives compounds interacting with the protein (M pro ), related to a specific biological activity, the manner in which they interact, and also the way a ligand (pyrazoline compounds) and M pro protein can bind. The crystal structure of COVID-19 main protease in complex with an inhibitor N3 has been realized by Jin Zheming et al. [46] the global symmetry of the complex is Cyclic-C2 and its global stoichiometry is Homo 2-mer-A2 (Figure 8) . with standard settings. We choose the compounds who have a binding affinity higher than -5kcal/mol for further analysis. We evaluate their interaction with the binding site of the target. The 3D interacting site of the ligands with the binding site of the protein are in the figure 9 , the Hydrogen bond interactions for all the compounds who have a binding activities less than -5kcal/mol with the protein are shown in figure 10 . The molecular docking scores of the compounds and the amino acids found in the active site pockets of M pro protein are showed in the table 4. Main protease has the hydrogen bond attractors and hydrogen bond donors with the amino acids in the binding site at a distance less than 2.73 Å. The 2D structure of the most active compounds interacting with the amino acids in the binding site of the Main protease show for complex Spiro G-M pro a hydrogen bond donor between oxygen atom of Spiro-G and CYS145, GLU166, hydrogen bond acceptor with the hydoxyd group (OH) of Spiro-G and ASN142. For Spiro-F, there are two hydrogen bonds donors with oxygen atom and CYS145 , GLN189, hydrogen bond donor between nitrogen atom and GLY143. For the Spiro C there are two hydrogen bonds between oxygen atom and SER144, THR26. Concerning the P1 compound there are three hydrogen bonds donors between oxygen atom and GLN189, GLY143, GLU 166. Finally, for P3, there are two hydrogen bonds donors between oxygen atom and GLU166, CYS145. We noted also, that the most common amino acids in the binding site for the different complexes are CYS145, GLU166 and GLY143. The comparison of the binding energy of our products (Spiro-C, Spiro G and P3) is greater than that of Lopinavir and the mixture of Lopinavir+Oseltamivir which have been used to cure MERS and SARS [73]. For all these compounds must be predicted their toxicity, druglikness and ADME (Data of ADME/ToX) using the preADMET server [74] . According to results associated with toxicity, druglikness and ADME we note the following. For the different pyrazolline products the Ames_test is non-mutagen. The risk associated with the hERG_inhibition is low and their CMC_like_Rule is qualified. The solubility of P1, P3, spiro-C, spiro-F and spiro-G in pure water is between 71-144 mg/l. The value of binding with the plasma protein is from 69.94 to 76.80, consequently, these products possess a good absorption. For more details about the prediction of ADME/Tox see suplementary (Data of ADME/ToX). In summary, the pyrazoline compounds may act as inhibitors of the COVID-M pro , and they deserve more investigations. @story_separate@The B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of computation was used to study the 1,3-DC reaction of diazomethane to PSH. The kinetic, thermodynamic and geometrical parameters associated with the formation of the different possible products were analysed in the gas phase and ether. The global and local reactivity indices at the ground state of the reagents were evaluated to understand the reactivity in the polar processes. Whereas the electrophilic and nucleophilic character of the reagents is are responsible for the high polar character of this 1,3-DC reaction, the energetic results for 1,3-DC reaction of diazomethane to PSH, indicate that the reaction path, leading to P1 product, is kinetically preferred. The addition of ether as a solvent has a weak influence on the kinetic and thermodynamic of the studied reaction without any influence on the chemo-, regio-and stereo-selectivity. ELF calculations reveal that the formation of the N3-C4 and C1-C5 bonds is done in two stages and one-step and the C1-C5 bond is more advanced than N3-C4 bond. The weak interactions associated with the VdW forces unfavored the addition of DZM in the cumbersome zone by weakening the forces of addition, leading to the formation of P1 product. Finally, the investigation about the inhibition of Mpro-COVID-19 by pyrazoline products have given encouraging results. More accurate researches on this family of products are worth undertaking for the struggle against COVID-19 virus. Supplementary data. Table S1 .

The DFT method at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory was used. Reactivity indices, transition structures theory, IGM and ELF analysis were employed to reveal the mechanism of the reaction. The addition of DZM to PSH takes place through a one-step mechanism and an asynchronous transition states. Eight possible addition channels of reaction were investigated (addition of C(sp2) to Diazomethane at C4, C5, C6 or C7). The addition of C (sp2) at C5 leading to P1 product is the preferred channel . The addition of ether does not affect the chemo-, regio- and stereo-selectivity of the reaction. Analysis of transfer of charges along the IRC path associated with the P1 product shows a polar character for the studied reaction. We have also used the noncovalent interaction (NCI) which is very helpful to reveal the most favored addition channel of the reaction, by analyzing the weak interactions in different TSs. Finally, we investigate about the potential of inhibition of some pyrazoline compounds against COVID-19-M(pro) by performing a molecular docking calculations."
"The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) Act substantially expanded unemployment insurance (UI) in order to help workers losing jobs as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. One provision of the Act creates an additional $600 weekly benefit known as the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC). The size of the payment-$600-was designed to replace 100% of the mean U.S. wage when combined with mean state UI benefits. In this paper, we use micro data on earnings together with the details of each state's UI system under the CARES Act to compute the distribution of UI benefit amounts from April to July 2020. We use these estimates to calculate the distribution of lost earnings replaced by unemployment benefits and how these replacement rates vary across occupations, industries and states. We focus primarily on measuring benefits owed to those who are eligible for regular Unemployment Compensation (henceforth referred to for brevity as the ""unemployed""). 1 Our baseline statutory replacement rate compares an unemployed worker's UI benefit to their lost wage earnings. However, we also compute a comprehensive replacement rate, which instead compares unemployment benefits to a broader measure of lost earnings which includes non-wage compensation like employer-provided health insurance and accounts for the differential tax treatment of labor income and UI. As designed, the ratio of mean unemployment benefits to mean pre-tax wages under CARES is roughly 100%. However, this masks substantial heterogeneity. We find that 76% of unemployed workers have a statutory replacement rate above 100%. 2 That means that three in four unemployed workers are eligible for benefits which exceed their lost wages. The median statutory replacement rate is 145%. 69% of unemployed workers have comprehensive replacement rates above 100% and so qualify for unemployment benefits which exceed total postpayroll tax wages and non-wage compensation. The median comprehensive replacement rate is 134%. These conclusions arise because the CARES Act sends a fixed $600 supplement to unemployed workers who have very different pre-job loss earnings: $600 is a larger percentage of pre-job loss earnings for low than for high earners. The CARES Act implemented a fixed supplement to all workers in part because it was viewed as infeasible to implement policies which depended on individual earnings. Since the $600 UI supplement was targeted to generate 100% earnings replacement based on mean earnings, this $600 supplement tends to imply greater than 100% earnings replacement for those with less than mean earnings. Furthermore, these high replacement rates for below-mean workers are amplified by the fact that the distribution of earnings is skewed: median earnings are less than mean earnings. This means that the typical unemployed worker has below-mean prior earnings and thus above-mean replacement rates. This implies that most workers have replacement rates above 100%. There is sizable variation in the effects of the CARES Act across occupations, industries and states. These in turn have important distributional consequences. For example, the median laid-off retail worker can collect 166% of their prior wage in UI, while grocery workers who remain employed are not receiving any automatic pay increases. Janitors working at businesses that remain open do not necessarily receive any hazard pay, while the median unemployed janitor who worked at businesses that shut down can collect 167% of their prior wage. Our results focus primarily on calculating replacement rates conditional on being unemployed. However, unemployment rates vary dramatically by income and across different occupations and industries. For this reason, it is interesting to explore how UI supplements affected the distributional incidence of the pandemic across these groups. In particular, we compute how the income of a typical worker in different groups changes on average over the pandemic given that groups' wages, unemployment rate and unemployment benefits, but without conditioning on an individual worker's ex-post employment status. 3 That is, we compute how the expansion of UI changed the expected income of a typical worker in a group during the pandemic. We find that the presence of the FPUC reverses group-level income patterns which would otherwise arise as a result of the pandemic. For example, unemployment rose more for retail workers than for teachers during the pandemic. Under normal UI benefits, this greater increase in unemployment would lead the expected income of retail workers to decline relative to that of teachers. However, under the $600 FPUC, these patterns reverse: expected income for the median retail worker actually rose, both in absolute terms and relative to the median teacher. We also find similar reversals when sorting by pre-job loss earnings: workers with low earnings prior to the pandemic were much more likely to become unemployed during the pandemic. Low earning workers would have thus faced greater declines in expected income than high earning workers under normal UI, which replaces only a fraction of lost earnings. Under the $600 FPUC, low-earning workers instead had greater ex-ante increases in expected income than high-earning workers. These results show that UI benefits are crucial for understanding the distributional incidence of the pandemic and that unlike in normal recessions, groups with dramatic declines in labor income during the pandemic do not necessarily have commensurate declines in overall cash flow once UI benefits are included. That is, while unemployment variation across different groups like industries or states is a good proxy for labor income variation, it is not a good proxy for total income variation during the early months of this recession. This is in turn important for understanding overall spending patterns during this recession (Bachas et al., 2020) . It also implies that research designs which rely on employment shift-shares as instruments for overall income must be interpreted with care during this recession. After documenting these basic patterns, we briefly explore how various alternative UI supplement policies like those currently debated in Congress or announced by the Presidential Memorandum on August 8, 2020 would alter the distribution of replacement rates. However, our paper is a purely descriptive analysis of the effects of UI supplements on household income, and we take no stand on optimal policy. Furthermore, it is important to note what our paper does and does not show. Our paper shows that the $600 supplement to UI through the FPUC led to high replacement rates and thus substantially boosted the income of the unemployed during the initial stages of the pandemic. Our paper does not provide any evidence on the consequences of this income support for other important outcomes of interest like spending or labor supply. However, concurrent research has begun to explore these implications. Farrell et al. (2020) finds that the marginal propensity to consume out of the $600 FPUC supplements was large, and argues that these supplements thus helped insure households against material hardship and stimulated aggregate demand. Casado et al. (2020) reaches similar conclusions using regional data. Indeed, Bachas et al. (2020) shows that the spending of low income households recovered most rapidly after the start of government stimulus and income support programs, even though low income households lost more labor income during the recession (Cajner et al., 2020a) . These papers imply that the liquidity provision and income support provided by the FPUC likely played an important positive role in stimulating aggregate spending. At the same time, very high replacement rates might be expected to deter labor supply and depress employment as the economy recovers. However, this is an empirical question, and so far early research has not found evidence that high replacement rates are deterring aggregate employment (see e.g. Altonji et al., 2020; Bartik et al., 2020, and Dube, 2020) . Limited labor supply effects in the presence of unemployment benefits which exceed wages could arise from the fact that the FPUC was temporary, with an initial expiration four months after the CARES Act was signed into law. Models of the labor market which include relevant search frictions predict that workers should compare the flow value of unemployment to the expected present discounted value of a potential employment match. Just because a worker can temporarily earn more on unemployment than by working does not necessarily mean that they will turn down an offer of employment. Petrosky-Nadeau (2020) and Boar and Mongey (2020) estimate that even with the $600 supplement, most unemployed would accept an offer at their previous wages. Furthermore, the effects of individual labor supply decisions on aggregate employment may depend on the overall tightness of the labor market. Disincentive effects of high unemployment benefits on labor supply are likely to matter less in a slack labor market with many more available workers than available jobs than in a healthy labor market with more jobs than available workers. Marinescu et al. (2020) show that vacancies fell much more than applications during the pandemic, which suggests that it should be easier rather than harder for employers to hire during the recession. Nevertheless, Barrero et al. (2020) show that even in the peak period of job losses, there were many businesses with both gross and net hiring. For example, as waiters were laid off, there was substantial hiring in food delivery, and Amazon increased employment in response to increased demand for online shopping. While we do not know of any current empirical estimates, high UI benefits could deter this type of beneficial labor reallocation. Furthermore, these types of labor supply disincentives from high replacement rates are likely to grow in importance as the public health threat diminishes and businesses again look to hire. This is one argument in favor of tying the level of unemployment benefit supplements to current economic conditions. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses our data and methodology. Section 3 shows the implications of FPUC for replacement rates over the earnings distribution. Section 4 explores incidence across occupations and states. Section 5 explores various robustness checks.@story_separate@While the basic intuition for why a fixed supplement can generate high replacement rates is simple, a careful accounting of the distribution 3 Most calculations in our paper focus on the distribution of benefits for which the unemployed are eligible. However, processing delays mean many unemployed workers face benefits delays (Bitler et al., 2020) . This analysis, which describes the implications for the overall distribution of income, takes into account these payment delays. of replacement rates requires combining data on the prior earnings of the unemployed with state-specific eligibility and benefit rules. 4 Our analysis of these interactions relies on two key ingredients: a simulator for unemployment benefits, and micro data with earnings and labor force status from the Current Population Survey (CPS). For the first ingredient, we construct estimates of the unemployment benefits received according to the ""Significant Provisions of State Unemployment Insurance Laws"" document produced in January 2020 (U.S. Department of Labor (2020)). This document outlines the eligibility criteria and benefit schedules by state. Where states have multiple ways to qualify for unemployment benefits, we allow only the primary listed way in the document. We calculate benefit amounts for a single unemployed person with no dependents. We do not consider eligibility through alternative base periods. To find benefit amounts under the CARES Act we add $600 to benefit amounts from January 2020. UI systems prior to the CARES Act typically provide benefits which are a fixed fraction of workers' previous earnings, up to some cap. For example, Fig. 1 shows the benefit schedule for Nevada both before and after the CARES Act. We show results for Nevada since it has average UI benefit levels in the middle of the national distribution, but qualitatively similar schedules apply in other states. The blue line shows the level of UI payments as a function of prior earnings. Nevada has a replacement rate of 52% of prior weekly earnings and a cap of $469, so benefits increase by 52 cents for each dollar of prior weekly earnings, until reaching a max benefit of $469 for workers with earnings above $902. This leads to a sharp kink at $902 and implies that replacement rates are below 52% for workers with higher earnings. The turquoise line shows the new benefit schedule under the CARES Act, which simply shifts the previous schedule vertically by $600. We also divide the benefit schedule along a 45 degree line where the level of benefits would exactly equal the level of previous earnings. Benefit values falling in the dark region above the 45 degree line are larger than earnings and imply replacement rates above 100%. Benefit values falling in the light region below the 45 degree line imply replacement rates below 100%. This figure shows that for workers with low earnings, UI benefits can potentially far exceed lost earnings. Under the CARES Act, replacement rates thus vary over the entire earnings distribution, so calculating the distribution of replacement rates requires information on the distribution of earnings. We estimate the earnings history of the unemployed by combining data from the 2019 Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) of the CPS with information on the distribution of unemployment in the basic monthly CPS from April-July 2020 (Ruggles et al., 2020) . 5 The ASEC survey was administered in February, March, and April 2019 and asks about labor supply in calendar year 2018. 6 States calculate UI benefits on the basis of a worker's quarterly earnings history, which is not available in the ASEC. We simulate quarterly earnings from the ASEC in two steps. First, we compute average weekly wage as the ratio of annual earnings to weeks worked last year. Second, we assume that each worker was working in the final week of 2018, and that they worked consecutively at the same average weekly earnings for the total number of weeks they reported working in 2018. This procedure makes their highest quarter earnings synonymous with their most recent quarter earnings. Throughout our analysis we restrict the sample to labor force participants who are US citizens, have average hourly earnings above the federal minimum wage ($7.25), and have sufficient simulated quarterly earnings history to be eligible for regular Unemployment Compensation in their state of residence. 7 There are 64,901 workers that meet these three criteria. Although the ASEC was run prior to the pandemic, our analysis captures the composition of likely UI claimants during the pandemic on several observable dimensions by using a companion data set built from the basic monthly CPS. Specifically, we study the probability of unemployment among CPS labor force participants in April, May, June, and July 2020 who also responded to a survey question about weekly earnings as part of the Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) in 2019. There are 61,378 workers that meet these criteria. We identify workers who are likely to meet the eligibility criteria to claim UI because they have a duration of unemployment of less than 26 weeks and were laid off from their prior jobs, to capture restrictions against voluntary quitters receiving UI. We refer to this group as the ""unemployed"" for brevity. 8 dollar increase in UI benefits leads to replacement rates above 100% for lower income workers. Our analysis quantifies the prevalence of this phenomenon using micro data. under the CARES Act, which adds a $600 supplement to weekly benefits. We choose Nevada for this illustrative example because it has average UI benefit levels in the middle of the national distribution. 5 Ideally, we would use micro data on workers who actually claim UI during the pandemic, but we are unaware of any publicly-available source of such data. 6 The CPS ASEC administered in spring 2020, which captures labor supply in calendar year 2019, will not be available until later in 2020, after this draft was written. 7 The ASEC explicitly asks workers about income from tips and we include tipped workers in our main sample in order to be as representative as possible. However, there is some evidence that tips are under-reported in the CPS. Whether this generates bias in our estimates depends on the nature of under-reporting of tips. If a tipped worker reports zero income from tips then our benefit simulator will likely judge them to be ineligible, and they are excluded from the analysis sample. However, if a worker reports only some tips, then our method overstates their replacement rate. To address this concern, we report a robustness check in Section 5.2 which is conservative in that it drops all workers in occupations with a high prevalence of tips. 8 This is a subset of the group that is used to compute the official unemployment rate. The official unemployment rate also includes people entering the labor market after a period of not working and people who quit their prior job. We use a reweighting procedure to make the pre-pandemic ASEC sample match the unemployed during the pandemic on observable characteristics. Specifically, we run the following logit regression in the basic monthly CPS sample, where WageDecile i is a fixed effect for decile of 2019 weekly earnings, State i is a state dummy, Occupation i is a fixed effect for two digit occupation, and Industry i is a fixed effect for two digit industry. We then use the estimated coefficients from this regression to predict an individual's probability of unemployment during the pandemic in the ASEC sample that we use for actual analysis of earnings. The analysis in this paper weights each worker in the ASEC by the product of their person weight and their probability of unemployment during the pandemic. Because unemployment during the pandemic is concentrated among those with low income, and the federal supplement is a fixed amount, this reweighting procedure modestly increases estimated replacement rates relative to using the raw ASEC data. (a) shows the distribution of pre-job loss weekly earnings among likely UI eligible households from April to July 2020 under this procedure. 9 There are two key features of the earnings distribution. First, there is substantial variance in earnings across workers. Second, the distribution is right-skewed, so that the mean earnings level of $886 during the pandemic is well above the median earnings level of $630 for the same time period. Concretely, this implies that most workers have earnings below the mean. Furthermore, the mean earnings of unemployed workers during the pandemic of $886 is itself lower than mean earnings of unemployed workers prior to the pandemic (in 2019) of $1010. This is because unemployment during this recession is concentrated among low earners, as shown in panel (b). This is important because the $600 payment under the CARES Act targeted an average replacement rate of 100%, but used data on mean earnings of the unemployed prior to the pandemic. Distribution of pre-job loss earnings and unemployment. Notes: we analyze employment and pre-job loss weekly earnings in April-July 2020 of workers who are eligible for regular unemployment compensation. Panel (a) shows the distribution of weekly earnings. Panel (b) shows the unemployment rate by quintiles of the earnings distribution (quintiles are defined without conditioning on unemployment and so capture the earnings distribution of all workers). 9 It is useful to note that a modest share of workers have pre-job loss weekly earnings below $290 (the product of the federal minimum wage and 40 h per week) despite the fact that we restrict analysis to those with average hourly earnings above the federal minimum wage; this pattern reflects workers who had part-time jobs prior to unemployment. Combining the ingredients in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 allows us to estimate the distribution of unemployment benefits. To assess the validity of our methodology, we compare our estimates to data on average benefits and pre-job loss earnings of actual UI claimants as reported by the Department of Labor. For April to July 2020, estimated average weekly benefits without FPUC in the US are $321, compared to actual average benefits of $308. Fig. A-1 panel (a) shows that our estimates closely track actual variation in UI benefits at the state level during the pandemic. Panels (b) and (c) of the same figure show that our estimates also track actual variation in UI benefit levels and pre-job loss earnings for the 2019 ASEC. The similarity of estimated average benefits and earnings to benchmarks from administrative data bolsters the credibility of our methods. In this paper we report results for two alternative definitions of the ""replacement rate"", which is the ratio of benefits to earnings. The first definition, which we refer to as the statutory replacement rate, is the ratio of pre-tax benefits to pre-tax earnings. State UI policies are formulated in terms of statutory replacement rates, and this is the definition that has been used in the prior academic literature. The second definition, which we refer to as the comprehensive replacement rate, incorporates two of the most important factors that affect the pecuniary benefits from work: payroll taxes (which lower the value of work) and non-wage compensation (which raises the value of work). Unfortunately, no individual-level survey captures all non-wage compensation. We impute non-wage compensation at the individual worker level by rescaling employer-provided health insurance contributions in the CPS ASEC by the ratio of total non-wage compensation to health insurance benefits in the BLS Employer Costs for Employee Compensation report. 10 We then add these imputed benefits at the individual worker-level to their labor earnings to impute worker-level total compensation. Most of the paper reports results in terms of statutory replacement rates, which do not require this imputation procedure and align with how state UI agencies traditionally set the level of UI benefits, but in Section 5 we report results in terms of comprehensive replacement rates. We also explore additional robustness checks which exclude tipped workers and which try to account for the presence of the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA program) and its interaction with lost self-employment earnings. Combining information on the distribution of prior earnings by the unemployed in each state with that state's benefit schedule allows us to estimate the level of replacement rates across the earnings distribution of the unemployed. Fig. 3 panel (a) shows these results. The horizontal line denotes a replacement rate of 100%. The facts that 1) most workers have earnings below the mean and 2) mean earnings of unemployed workers during the pandemic are themselves lower than the mean earnings prior to the pandemic (that were targeted with the $600 supplement) imply substantial replacement rates for the typical unemployed worker during the pandemic. Under the CARES Act, 76% of workers have replacement rates above 100%. 11 The median replacement rate is 145% and a typical worker in the bottom two deciles of the income distribution has a replacement rate of more than 200%. Fig. 3 panel (b) shows how UI benefits under the CARES Act compare to earnings for unemployed workers in various occupations. 12 This figure again shows substantial variation: lower-wage jobs effectively have much higher replacement rates than higher wage jobs, often substantially above 100%. This has important distributional and equity implications, even for workers in the same occupation. For example, unemployed janitors who worked at businesses which are closed can get UI benefits equal to 167% of their prior earnings, while janitors who continue to work at increased health risk in businesses deemed ""essential"" have no guarantees of any hazard pay or increased earnings. 13 Appendix Fig. A-3 and corresponding Appendix Table A -1 shows how typical replacement rates under CARES vary across states. While there is substantial variation across states, the median replacement rate in all states is well above 100%. The intuition for the distribution of replacement rates across states is similar to the intuition for the distribution across the earnings distribution discussed above: when a fixed $600 supplement is added to everyone's benefits, states with the lowest pre-job loss earnings of the unemployed will have the highest replacement rates. We note that this is similar to, but not the same as, more commonly reported statistics of typical earnings for all workers in a state. Oklahoma has the highest replacement rate. The median UI eligible worker in Oklahoma has a replacement rate of 165%. Georgia and New Mexico are the next highest, with median replacement rates of 163% and 162%. Arizona has the lowest median replacement rate. The median UI eligible worker in Arizona can receive benefits equal to 119% of lost earnings. Massachusetts and New York are the next lowest, with median replacement rates of 135% in both states. Our estimated replacement rates are similar to actual replacement rates calculated using administrative data from California. We estimate a median replacement rate in California of 142.6% (standard error 3.2 percentage points) while the California Policy Lab finds a replacement rate of 136.3%. 14 Further, we find a median replacement rate for Californians who are unemployed in the ""Leisure and Hospitality"" industry of 172% vs. 173% in the California administrative claims data. The similarity of our estimates, which require a benefit calculator and combining evidence from multiple CPS surveys, to statistics for the one state where administrative data are available bolsters the credibility of our findings. Our results thus far calculate the replacement rates that workers are eligible for, conditional on being unemployed and claiming UI benefits. However, unemployment rates vary dramatically across the income distribution and for different sectors of the economy, so it is interesting to compute the effect of UI supplements on the overall distribution of income for workers in different occupations and industries. The specific question we ask is: from an ex ante perspective, how might a worker in different sectors expect their income to change from the pandemic without conditioning on employment status? To capture heterogeneity in how incomes have changed during the pandemic, we combine information on pre-job loss earnings, 10 Specifically, we multiply employer-provided health benefits by (7.95-2.16)/2.60 = 2.23 to estimate total benefits. This scaling factor arises from information on employer benefit costs from Bureau of Labor Statistics (2020). We focus on private industry workers where unemployment is currently concentrated and exclude employer taxes (legally required benefits). This analysis uses the 2017 ASEC, because the employer-provided health benefits variable is unavailable in the 2019 ASEC. 11 In a prior draft, we estimated that 68% of unemployed workers had benefits that exceed wages. That draft did not reweight to match the distribution of characteristics of the unemployed during the pandemic since this data was unavailable at the time of writing. Our current estimate of 76% is slightly below estimates by the CBO produced after our initial draft: https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-06/56387-CBO-Grassley-Letter.pdf. This modest difference likely in part reflects that they compare UI benefits to ""potential wages"", which they assume will be depressed relative than to prior wages. 12 Fig. A-2 shows similar results by industry. 13 The large estimated replacement rates for food service workers raise the concern that we may be under-measuring tips in occupations where tips are common and therefore may lead us to overstate replacement rates. However, Section 5 shows that dropping occupations where tips are common has little effect on our conclusions. 14 https://www.capolicylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-2nd-Analysis-of-UI-Claims-in-California-During-the-COVID-19-Pandemic.pdf. unemployment rates in May 2019 and May 2020, and imputed UI benefits with and without the $600 FPUC supplement. It is important to note that not all unemployed workers received benefits in May 2020 because of delays in processing UI claims as well as eligibility rules (e.g. undocumented workers are not eligible). We estimate recipiency rates as the ratio of actual benefits paid out to the benefits that would have been paid out if every unemployed worker had received benefits; this yields an estimated UI recipiency rate of 77% in May 2020. 15 Table 1 shows how expected income (labor income if employed or UI benefits times the probability of benefit recipiency if unemployed) for a worker with the median wage in different groups changed as a result of the group-specific increase in unemployment during the pandemic. 16 In Appendix Table A -2 we show similar results by industry. 17 The median change without FPUC shows the percentage change in income during the pandemic absent the FPUC supplement, while the median change with FPUC shows our estimate of how income changed under the enhanced UI system. We find that the presence of the FPUC reverses income patterns by income level and sector which would otherwise arise as a result of the pandemic. For example, Table 1 panel (a) shows that under normal UI benefits, expected income for median workers in the bottom quintile would have fallen by 9.3%, but with the $600 FPUC it rose by 19.5%. In a similar vein, panel (b) shows that unemployment rose more for retail workers than for teachers during the pandemic. Under normal UI 15 The numerator in this calculation is benefits paid out in May 2020 for regular unemployment compensation from Department of Labor Form 5159. To calculate the denominator, which is the budgetary cost if every unemployed worker had received benefits, we multiply the average benefit in our analysis sample by the number of unemployed within each group. This calculation assumes an aggregate unemployment rate of 16.3%, which is the May 2020 unemployment rate after correcting for misclassification error. The unemployed are distributed between groups in Table 1 (and, in the case of the occupation analysis, occupations not listed) according to the estimated unemployment rates reported in the table. Note that the numerator in this calculation uses only regular unemployment compensation, while the denominator includes both people eligible for regular unemployment compensation as well as those eligible for PUA (but ineligible for regular unemployment compensation). Thus, this calculation is a lower bound on the PUAinclusive UI recipiency rate. See Cajner et al. (2020b) for a careful reconciliation of UI claims and unemployment during the pandemic. 16 Cajner et al. (2020a) provides evidence that wage changes conditional on employment have been modest during the recession, and we do not have 2020 ASEC data, so we assume that earnings conditional on employment in May 2020 are the same as in May 2019. 17 In addition, we have also explored results which compute expected changes in income for which workers are eligible rather than expected changes in the actual income they receive; that is assuming recipiency rates of 100%. Conclusions are similar. Fig. 3 . Statutory replacement rates. Notes: this figure shows the fraction of pre-tax earnings that are replaced by unemployment benefits (statutory replacement rates). In panel (a) the bins correspond to deciles of the pre-job loss weekly earnings distribution for the unemployed and we report replacement rates for the median unemployed worker in each bin. Panel (b) shows the median fraction of pre-tax earnings that are replaced by unemployment benefits (statutory replacement rates) for workers in eleven of the most common occupations. The horizontal line in both panels shows a replacement rate of 100%, which is where benefits are equal to earnings. The estimates are statistically precise; Table 2 provides standard errors on the distribution of replacement rates and the standard error for the occupation-level estimates is always less than 4.3 percentage points. benefits, this greater increase in unemployment leads the expected income for the median retail worker to decline by 7.7% while the income of the median teacher falls by 5.6%. Under the FPUC, these patterns reverse: rather than falling, expected income for retail workers actually rises by 4.7% during the pandemic, and teachers' expected income is essentially unchanged. Looking at incidence by industry in Table A -2 shows that the presence of the FPUC undoes what would otherwise be massive income declines for workers in ""Leisure and Hospitality"", ""Other services"", and ""Wholesale and retail trade"" industries. These results show that UI benefits are crucial for understanding the distributional incidence of the pandemic and that sectors with the most dramatic declines in labor income do not necessarily have the most dramatic declines in income inclusive of UI transfers. Our paper's key estimates are of the distribution of statutory replacement rates, which we find are 103% at the 25th percentile, 145% at the 50th percentile, and 195% at the 75th percentile, together with the 76% share of the unemployed eligible for benefits above pre-job loss earnings. In this section, we explore the robustness of our results on a number of important dimensions. Table 2 reports all of these results. While we concentrate on point estimates throughout our analysis in the prior sections, our main replacement rate estimates are statistically precise, with standard errors ranging from 0.7 to 3.1 percentage points. These standard errors capture sampling uncertainty from both the ASEC and the MORG. To account for sampling uncertainty in the ASEC we use the replicate weights calculated by the Census. These replicate weights ensure the standard errors take into account the complex sampling structure of the ASEC. Replicate weights are unavailable for the MORG from Ruggles et al. (2020) , so to account for sampling uncertainty in the MORG, we instead bootstrap using 300 bootstrap replicates. While the standard errors for more disaggregated results like state-level replacement rates are modestly larger than those for national results, they remain fairly precisely estimated. While results thus far focus on statutory replacement rates, many workers receive non-wage compensation like employer-provided health benefits, retirement contributions and paid leave. For workers with any non-wage compensation, statutory replacement rates which compare UI benefits to lost wages will exceed replacement rates which compare UI benefits to total compensation. The ""Include non-Wage compensation"" row shows that resulting replacement rates remain quite high. The median replacement rate is 125% and 65% of UI eligible workers have replacement rates above 100%. 18 We next explore the role of differential tax treatment of UI benefits and labor income. Labor income up to $137,700 is subject to a payroll tax of 7.65% while unemployment benefits are not considered earned income and so are exempt from this payroll tax. 19 This means that 18 Accounting for non-wage compensation does lower replacement rates, but it does not change the conclusion that the vast majority of workers have replacement rates above 100%. This stands in contrast to an interpretation of results in Sawo and Evermore (2020) based on industry averages. However, as we noted above, skewed earnings distributions make it difficult to interpret calculations based on averages. We have replicated their finding that most unemployed workers are in industries where the industry average UI benefit is below the industry average total compensation. Despite this industry-level pattern, Table 2 shows that most individual unemployed workers indeed have UI benefits which exceed their individual total compensation. 19 The Executive Order issued on August 8, 2020 makes the ongoing payroll tax treatment of labor income uncertain, but our estimates focus on the period prior to FPUC expiration which precedes this order. This table shows how the US income distribution changed from the increase in unemployment from May 2019 to May 2020 and the $600 supplement to unemployment benefits known as Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC). Weekly earnings is the median of weekly earnings for employed workers in that earnings quintile or occupation in the 2019 ASEC. The earnings for employed worker i are the same in 2019 and 2020: w i, 2020 = w i, 2019 . Expected income for worker i in quintile or occupation j is E i, t = w i, t × (1 − u j(i),t ) + u j (i),t × benefit i, t . u j(i),t is the unemployment rate in group j in period t and benefit i, t is an estimate of the benefit that worker i is eligible for times an estimate of the recipiency rate of unemployment benefits for unemployed workers in period t. The final two columns then compute for each quintile or occupation: Median j (E i, 2020 /E i, 2019 ) with and without the $600 FPUC. In panel (a), quintiles are defined without conditioning on unemployment and so capture the earnings distribution of all workers. The unemployment rate in panel (a) differs from Fig. 2 panel (b) because that panel captures April through July 2020, while this table examines only May 2020. after-tax replacement rates are higher than the pre-tax statutory rates that our paper focuses on. Accounting for the fact that UI benefits are not subject to payroll taxes raises the median after-tax replacement rate from 145% to 157%. 20 The share of unemployed with after-tax replacement rates above 100% is 80%. Combining the adjustments for non-wage compensation and payroll taxes gives us our preferred comprehensive measure of replacement rates in Table 2 . 69% of workers have comprehensive replacement rate above 100% and the median value of this replacement rate is 134%. Thus, most regular UI eligible workers have after-tax UI benefits which exceed their total lost labor compensation. We next explore the role of tips. The high replacement rates for food service workers stand out in Fig. 3b . Workers in these occupations are often paid tips. While the CPS survey prompts workers to include tips in their earnings, there is some concern that these may be underreported. If workers understate their total pay, then we may overstate their replacement rates. To address this concern, we recompute our main statistics after excluding workers in occupations where tips and commissions are important. 21 Table 2 shows that replacement rates after excluding tipped occupations are reduced slightly but remain quite high. This shows that our conclusions are not driven by under counting income for workers who typically earn tips. Our main results focus on replacement rates for recipients of regular Unemployment Compensation (UC). We focus on UC because there is much better data on the program's administration. However, PUA expanded benefit eligibility to a much larger set of workers who do not meet the normal state monetary eligibility threshold for UC. To explore the role of PUA for our results, we assume that job losers in the CPS not meeting the UC monetary eligibility threshold instead qualify for PUA. This methodology captures people with limited prior earnings who are eligible for PUA, but does not capture self-employed people who are eligible for PUA. We further assume that these workers then receive UI payments equal to one-half of the state average UI benefit amount in addition to the $600 FPUC. 22 Table 2 shows that including PUA recipients modestly increases statutory replacement rates. We next explore interactions between PUA and UC. These interactions mean that some workers who qualify for UC may have replacement rates measured in terms of wage earnings which are larger than their replacement rates measured under a broader notion of labor earnings. In particular, the PUA program expanded UI eligibility to cover many workers with self-employment income. However, PUA is only available for workers who do not qualify for UC. This means that workers with enough wage income to qualify for UC must collect UC benefits even if they have self-employment income which exceeds wage income. For these workers, measuring replacement rates in terms of wage earnings will overstate overall replacement rates. To explore this issue, for each individual we add wage income to self-employment income in the CPS to get a broader measure of earnings. We continue to restrict the sample to UC eligible workers who qualify for benefits based on their wage earnings, but then compute replacement rates as the ratio of benefits to wages plus self-employment income. Table 2 shows that including self-employment for these workers has a negligible effect on replacement rates. This is because there are very few workers who qualify for UC based on wage income but also have sizable self-employment income. 23 In the final part of this note, we evaluate the distributional consequences of supplementary fixed payments of various sizes. Although the CARES Act used a $600 supplement, Congress has debated a range of values for continuing supplements. In Fig. 4 , we show how the distribution of replacement rates varies with fixed payments. The diagonal black line shows the share of workers with replacement rates above 100%. The figure demonstrates that it is quite difficult to achieve high replacement rates for most workers without also having replacement rates over 100% for many workers. Fig. A-4 shows an alternative visualization of the same information using bar charts.@story_separate@The expanded UI system enacted under CARES implied high replacement rates well over 100% for most workers. High replacement rates can provide crucial liquidity necessary for households to smooth consumption during this unprecedented period of economic dislocation. Notably, a fixed dollar supplement provides the largest comparative benefit to the lowest income workers, who might otherwise be especially hurt by this recession. At the same time, replacement rates over 20 1.57/1.45 = 1/(1-0.0765). 21 See our online replication materials for the classification of tipped occupations. We use an expansive definition of occupations with tips and commissions that includes 35% of workers. 22 This corresponds to the minimum PUA payout amount. Preliminary data suggests that most PUA recipients are receiving this minimum payment. However, accounting for PUA recipients who receive benefits above this minimum would further increase implied replacement rates and so amplify our conclusions. 23 In the CPS only 0.17% (104/62204) of workers with sufficient wage earnings to be eligible for UC have self-employment income which exceeds wage income. This table shows how the distribution of replacement rates changes under alternative assumptions. The top row shows our main estimate of statutory replacement rates. Standard errors in percentage points are in parentheses. For example, the median replacement rate is 145% with a standard error of 1.4 percentage points. The first three rows of robustness checks show the effects of incorporating non-wage compensation and payroll tax. The third row is our preferred comprehensive measure of replacement rates. The fourth row drops tipped workers, for whom the CPS may understate earnings, thereby leading to an over-estimate of replacement rates. The fifth row includes PUA recipients. The sixth row includes self-employment income in the measure of earnings. 100% may hamper efficient labor reallocation during an eventual economic recovery. That is, expanded UI induces potential trade-offs between consumption smoothing and moral hazard. Finally, we note that high replacement rates introduce important distributional concerns. This system essentially pays bonuses to some workers who are laid off (which might lead to advantageous increases in social distancing) but provides no additional pay for otherwise similar ""essential"" workers. We take no stand in this paper on the empirical size of or optimal way to balance these trade-offs, but we note that this is an area of substantial current academic and policy interest. Overall, the $600 supplement had important effects on the incidence of the pandemic across different sectors. It was in fact large enough to reverse sectoral income changes which would have otherwise arisen from large increases in unemployment. Our results thus show that the $600 FPUC was central to overall income dynamics during the early parts of the pandemic. Notes: this table reports the median statutory replacement rate for April through July 2020 with and without Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC). The median replacement rates we report exceed measures of mean replacement rates calculated a part of the Department of Labor's Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) program. For example, using the 2019 ASEC to model benefits in 2019Q2, we find that the national median replacement rate is 50% while the mean ""replacement rate 2"" in BAM is 36%. This is because benefits schedules have caps, which lower replacement rates for unemployed with high pre-job loss earnings. These caps bring down mean replacement rates but are not relevant for the median unemployed worker. Many states have a reported standard error of zero for their replacement rate without FPUC. The best way to convey the intuition for how this can arise is to consider a scenario where there is no cap in unemployment benefits, so every worker has the same replacement rate. In this case, regardless of whether the inference procedure is a bootstrap or replicate weights, we will find that there is no sampling-based uncertainty about the median replacement rate. In practice, states with benefit caps that are high relative to the median wage for unemployed workers will have a standard error of zero.","We use micro data on earnings together with the details of each state's unemployment insurance (UI) system to compute the distribution of UI benefits after the uniform $600 Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) supplement implemented by the CARES Act. We find that between April and July 2020, 76% of workers eligible for regular Unemployment Compensation have statutory replacement rates above 100%, meaning that they are eligible for benefits which exceed lost wages. The median statutory replacement rate is 145%. We also compute comprehensive replacement rates, which account for employer provided non-wage compensation and differential tax treatment of labor income and UI. 69% of UI-eligible unemployed have comprehensive replacement rates above 100% and the median comprehensive replacement rate is 134%. The presence of the FPUC has important implications for the incidence of the recession and reverses income patterns which would have otherwise arisen across income levels, occupations, and industries."
"""Poetry offers psychology its own perspective on the reaches of the realm, a unique repository not only of energy, but also of imagery, metaphor, paradox, inversion, contradiction, and often enough beauty. Poetry valorizes and embraces the resources of the unconscious."" (Akhter, 2013) . Prominent psychologists have unabashedly, and with great reverence, recognized poetry as portal into the subconscious. Carl Jung, for example, notes that ""the poet who responds to the prompting of the unconscious is able to tap deep emotional sources"" (Jung, 2015) . In this light, he may have regarded poets as a type of well-travelled depth psychologist-aeronauts of the underworld. Robert Romanyshyn (2007) acknowledges poetry as an expression, an art, of the soul. He regards psychologists, seemingly with a sense of exasperation, as ""failed poets"" for a lack of ability to fully bridge the gap between the conscious and unconscious minds, as is the natural aptitude of poets. His overarching message seems to be that an inability to bridge this gap limits the psychologist's ability to discern the key momentary truths, and thus, he urges modern psychologists to ""keep the soul in mind"" in order to hone their aptitudes for sensibility towards that of a poet. Wachs (2011) explores psychology's need for poetry, concluding that poetry is a means by which a person can become sensible through the discovery of purpose, finding the meaningfulness in and of their lives. Writing and reading poetry is, therefore, a process by which one can literally and figuratively come to their senses-in psychological terms, achieve mental health. What, then, is the psychologically-transformative potential of poetry when it seems the world has gone mad? In what way can poetry be an ally of the psyche and the psychologist when the collective unconscious casts its thick, broad shadow across the societal landscape? In what way can poetry light the way for revolution, a turnaround-perhaps the necessary psychotic break-through which the human species can face its self in the chaotic darkness of separation from our shared humanity? On May 25, 2020, as part of the American University in Paris' Conference on the Psychology of Global Crises, we collaborated in a panel discussion entitled, the Poetics of Crisis in which we explored how crisis gives voice and purpose to poetry and how poetry gives voice and purpose to crisis. Each of us spoke to the theme from personal and transpersonal perspectives influenced by our shared interests in nature and human nature. We read crisisthemed poems from our own award-winning literary publications, responded to participate questions, and concluded by jointly reciting Rainer Maria Rilke's poem, I Am Much Too Alone in This World, Yet Not Alone (https ://www.youtu be.com/watch ?v=mq3vL zOm5H c; accessed 9 July 2020). At the time of the event, the entire world was experiencing the early stages of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the agent of COVID-19 disease), a pandemic driven by the combined forces of habitat destruction, land use change, and globalization of the trade, travel, and transport sectors. ""All around the world, -we the entire human species -are now encaved in our homes. Isolation, loneliness and, for some, forced fasting invoke a dark night of the soul. Death is dancing in front of billions of witnesses."" (Reaser, 2020) . On the same day-at the same time-of our presentation, racism was a darkness creeping across New York City's Central Park, at the margins of bird-enlivened shrubby undergrowth, and also on an asphalt street of Minneapolis, MN, where eight minutes demonstrated that humanity has not spent enough time seeking itself out among the brambles that grow at the psyche's margins, where we decide what of the soul lives and dies underneath our individual and collective skin. ""I thought my color would cost me my life…I'm not alone, though. I have friendsblack friends-who've also experienced the lingering looks, the stares of distaste. They've endured comments about their color flung within earshot. I look at maps through this lens-at the places where tolerance seems to thrive, and where hate and racism seem to fester-and think about where I want to be."" (Lanham 2016) . What could we, purveyors of lyrically inclined small words and phrases, offer to the masses in a time of thickening, global-scale crises? Just that: the profound, readily accessible beauty that exists in the simplicity of being-calling, guiding, and uniting wherever there is courage enough to exalt the sky with dawn-invoking voices. Continuing the conversation that we began as panelists, we have offered further reflection on the poetics of crisis in a Reimaging Magazine collaboration (reimaginingmagazine.com). Here, in the special issue of Human Arenas associated with the Psychology of Global Crisis 2020 conference, we enter into dialogue again, exploring poetry's role in protest, acceptance, and revolution.@story_separate@Q/JKR: Crisis exists at the interface of dissolution and emergence. Stéphane Mallarmé, a nineteenth century French poet, wrote that ""poetry is the language of a state of crisis"" (Mallarmé et al. 2006) . In your own experience how this is true, and how is this truth reflected in your own poetry? A/TH: On a very personal level, I can say that much of my own poetry has arisen out of crisis, whether it be personal or global. Poetry is beauty, of course, but I think some pain is required, too. Most of the work of the poet isn't writing; it's loving the world enough to suffer with it. Loving the world enough, feeling its depth and subjectivity, inevitably involves experiencing its pain. A/JDL: I see poetry as the art of the immediate. These plagues -yes, plagues -of nature, politics, and bias, are immediately abundant targets for poetic reflection and introspection. For me, it is all a flash flood rising overland. The struggle is to not be overcome. And so, I write to the moment more than any memory of it. I write to feel the raw of the instant-whether joy of some beauty or despair of some pain-so that what I felt is felt. There is something lost beyond that instant. My poetry is mostly plein air in that I want it soaked in what I see or hear or smell or touch or otherwise sense in being in the midst of whatever is happening. I always feel that the editing process dulls the sharpness if one isn't careful in the post-processing. I believe poetry to be the tool of the immediate and so, now as much as any before, the world demands our work reflect the now. Q/JKR: In his essay, I Thought You Were a Poet, Joshua Mehigan (2011) explores the link between poetry and psychological distress, noting that when King Lear is mad, he speaks prose. All of us have published works in prosaic and poetic form. We've written books and articles from the persona of scientists, teachers, and cultural change agents. Our ""pens"" have options. Why and how can poetry attend to crisis, to an unmaddening of the crowd, in a way that prose cannot? A/TH: On some level, crisis involves a collapsing of self and identity that simply cannot be articulated in prose. If prose can explain things as they are, poetry can reimagine them, can offer possibilities for what might be. The poet can bring forth what might even seem impossible. A/JDL: Poetry is an act of emotional efficiency in many ways. I like to think of it as extended haiku. How best to say what's felt in fewest words-or the best words. Poetry is a practice that demands constant work. I don't believe that any poem is ever ""finished"" as one might conclude an essay. A poem concludes for the moment of feeling; there is nothing left to say beyond the moment. The flower is the flower in that moment. The new that has visited it just moments before or the butterfly that may come after our seeing it, is not necessarily the concern of the poem. That challenge of immediacy prevails in my poetics. I think it's crucial in these times that we show our current states of being, painful as they are. Q/TH: We are confronted with myriad crises, inter-connected through the symbols and stories of capitalist civilization. We need new language, language that reflects a more holistic, ecological, organic worldview. How do you see the transformation of language in the world that is emerging through the crisis of climate, health, and social justice movements? What are the ways we communicate now that interfere with our fully embracing the changes that are emerging? A/JDL: We talk past one another to crowds of emoticons and ""likes"" that do not allow us to be intimate in our dealings. We are crowd sourcing words and in some ways that is an immensely powerful and useful lever. In other ways, though, it dulls us. We know one another by avatar more than true face, and so we become numb in conversations driven more by algorithm than shared interest. A/JKR: In the context of our current societal crises and their associated movements, I have been giving considerable thought to the words resistance and resilience. From my perspective, to resist is to set boundaries. It is to say, ""No!"" to a potential violation. To resist provides an opportunity for a pause, perhaps a stop, to a process-a flow of energy. Resistance can hold space for transformation to occur, but it is not in and of itself the act of transformation. Resilience permits the enactment of a process, a force, but also the recovery from it. Resilience is more of a creative force than resistance, but it is not explicitly generative-the word speaks to a return to a pre-existing condition, but not growth, not expansiveness. I'm searching for the third word, a word that explicitly leads us through a transformative process into a state of being and behaving that is more unifying than polarizing, more uplifting than degrading, more generatively witnessing than shaming, more sustainable than depleting. I want the word the phoenix calls out when it takes flight. Q/JDL: At what point does your poetry become protest? What's the intent of your words-to assuage or incite? A/TH: In a sense, all poetry is protest. For it rales against the tendency to reduce our world to the prosaic, the tyranny of the quantifiable. Poetry affirms that there are ways of knowing that aren't reducible to the rational and logical mind. Moreover, it affirms that we can find joy and beauty in the midst of the struggle. A/JKR: I think poetry is always in protest of what is hidden, untrue, and divisive. Poetry is a call to attentiveness-externally and internally. It is also a conveyance by which we can reach an understanding of the personal as transpersonal and visa-versa; poetry unveils and calls forth relatedness. In this regard, poetry is a protest against deliberate attempts to use words to conceal, falsify, divide, and isolate in order to instigate and maintain injustices. My writing explores the interface of Nature and human nature, always through the voice of a truthsayer-sometimes human, sometimes other-than-human. A truthsayer's toolkit needs to include words that assuage, as well as words that incite. In some contexts, particularly those that are crisis-driven, the same word may play both roles-motivating some people toward a platform or issue and others away from it. At this time in U.S. history, this includes words associated with our sense of national identity: patriot, citizen, native, alien, immigrant, and colonist to name a few. Q/JDL: What's the rationale for writing to beauty in a time of pain, of crisis? A/TH: This is the greatest of all protests, isn't it? ""To fall in love with the world,"" as Derek Walcott says, ""in spite of history"" (Wallcott 1992) . I would suggest that one of the purposes of fascism is to breed nihilism and cynicism. Justice and joy must come together for a true revolution to take place; for the opposite of the cynicism of fascism isn't leftist politics-although that helps-but poetry. Those with a wide range of aesthetic value are inherently more attentive to nuance-diversity and difference-but are also more inclusive. They may be more inclined to seek understanding in painful situations because they recognize understanding as a process by which cosmologies can be further expanded, unveiling even more beauty. The recognition of beauty during crisis is a bold act of association and attentiveness. Beauty is what can anoint a wound, making it sacred. That is the alchemy of healing for a deeply wounded person, place, or People. Thus, writing to beauty in a time of pain is an active prayer for understanding, acceptance, and solidarity through beingness-the relatedness of all life. This is our collective ""be"" longing. Q/TH: Revolution requires new language. Our words reflect and create the worldview that defines us. It is through our worlds that we come to understand power relationships and where we each fit in. So, while changing the political or legal realities is important, we often get trapped in the same cycles if we cannot change our language-our way of seeing the world. In what way(s) do words and the way we use them matter in a fight against injustice? A/JDL: I believe that now must hold fast to the true democracy of the words we use. We cannot censor or censure ideas lest we censor ourselves down the line. Say what you mean and write that. Now is not the time for mollycoddling the language. We must be careful in how we wield the power of words, but we must also use the power to great and good effect. I don't believe in word or phrase ownership. However, we must always bear in mind the barter between words and meaning -whether perceived or real. A term of endearment for some that is the horrific racist slander when used by others, cannot be punctuated out in half spelling. It still bears power in the hieroglyphs. A/JKR: Words are energetic imprints that we construct and respond to. They are a currency of relationship, having the ability to deplete or strengthen human bonds. Beliefs about the meaning of words give words their action potential-to polarize or unify. Despite the existence of dictionaries, word meanings are dynamic-they change over time and with context. Human conflict is frequently a war of words driven by different projections of meaning onto a series of letters-with each person presuming their projected meaning is, or should be, fixed and universal. Word meanings are perceived to have value and that value is interpreted emotionally. Word use violations, as judged by individuals or society, are thus experienced as a violation of values-and core values are generally regarded as something worth fighting for, a just cause. We have an ethical responsibility for word choice, as well as to do our best to understand another narrator's choice of words.@story_separate@""If we are to once again experience the cosmos as our womb, to participate meaningfully in the awesome event called the universe, then we must simply work outside, pause, and look at the shining stars, or see a child being born, or listen to a tree's leaves rustling in the wind, and be amazed."" (Richards 2011) . Every act of birthing involves crisis. Coming again into the world is an opportunity to see with new eyes, listen with new ears, to feel-differently and universally. What we need now is to recognize that this birthing is not an act of separation from our most nourishing source but a cry for unification that requires the human soul to take form. We conclude with an offering, a simple yet profound invitation to lift your own pen and vulnerably courageous voice: Come alive, now, in this morbidly rich writing environment. Wade into the midst of the pain and despair to tell the truth, letting others know the depth of it and how easy it is to become stuck. Write to the immediate, fearlessly. Give the words permission to cut as close to the edge, to whatever moved you to sense the very first word or craft the enduring phrase-the one that won't let go of you, that provides lift. Write to the beauty that triumphs its way up out of the mire-somehow, always. In the practice of poetics, persistence is hope. It is what gives words the synonymy of freedom and home. May we-as individuals and a species-come to our senses in the midst of crisis and, in doing so, discover that the leaves we hear rustling adorn the tree of all life. May we be amazed by its beauty?","As part of the American University in Paris’ 2020 Conference on the Psychology of Global Crises, we collaborated in a panel discussion entitled the Poetics of Crisis in which we explored the role of poetry as a medium of personal and transpersonal expression during times of crisis, as well as a means for transmuting crisis into an opportunity, a platform, for generative change. Here, we continue the dialogue, three award-winning poets exploring how words—through our own approach to literary writing—can invoke human potential during challenging times. We reflect on poetry in form, as an offering to and conveyance of beauty amidst pain, as protest in the way that it can demarcate what no longer serves sentiment and survival, and as a spark of revolution—the inspiration and guide when the necessary changes are called out and called up for the sake of humanity. We conclude with a poetic invitation."
"During the past decades, more than 100 antiviral agents or their combinations have been approved to treat 9 human infection diseases: HIV, HCV, influenza virus, RSV, HSV, HCMV, VZV, HBV, and variola virus (human smallpox). Antiviral agents can be possibly classified based on their chemical structures, drug targets, or mechanisms of action. For instance, most antiviral agents target either viral enzymes to block the viral replication or viral surface proteins to prevent the viral entry. Regarding the mechanisms of action, nucleoside analogs are effective viral polymerase inhibitors that resemble naturally occurring nucleosides to cause the termination of the nascent viral DNA chain, while protease inhibitors block the proteolytic processing by competing with protease substrate peptides. Based on the chemical structures, aciclovir and valaciclovir are classified as acyclic guanosine analogs to treat DNA viruses such as HSV and VZV, while cidofovir, adefovir, tenofovir alafenamide are acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogs to treat HCMV, HBV, and HIV, respectively. Due to the variable nature of antiviral agents, this book article attempts to characterize the antiviral classification based on the drug targets in 9 human infectious diseases.@story_separate@HIV Reverse Transcriptase HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) is an asymmetric heterodimer which harbors two enzymatic domains: the RNA-and DNAdependent DNA polymerase and the ribonuclease H . After the viral entry of HIV particles, HIV RT produces the viral DNA genome based on the template of the single-stranded viral RNA genome released from HIV particles (Das et al., 2019) . To inhibit HIV genome replication, nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) have been successfully developed to target HIV RTan indispensable enzyme for HIV replication. On the one hand, the 5 0triphosphate of the NRTIs act as chain terminators. Because NRTIs lack a 3 0 -OH group, the incorporation of NRTIs into the newly synthesized viral dsDNA terminates the elongation of DNA primer, thereby blocking HIV reverse transcription (Das and Arnold, 2013) . On the other hand, NNRTIs are allosteric inhibitors that allosterically target a hydrophobic pocket located approximately 10-15 Åfrom the catalytic site of HIV-1 RT (Sluis-Cremer and Tachedjian, 2008) . This causes conformation changes of the HIV-1 RT catalytic site, thus interrupting the viral dsDNA replication . As of September 2020, fifteen HIV RT inhibitors have been approved by the US FDA for clinical use, including (1) seven NRTIs: zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir, emtricitabine; two NtRTIs (nucleotide RT inhibitors): tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and tenofovir alafenamide; and (2) six NNRTIs: nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, etravirine, rilpivirine, and doravirine. Elsulfavirine has only been approved in Russia. For more than two decades, NRTIs have been clinically used as the backbone in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART, a combination of Z3 antiretroviral drugs), while NNRTIs often serve as the third agent. Currently, tenofovir alafenamide and doravirine are widely administered in clinical practice because of a high genetic barrier to resistance, high safety profile, and low frequency of administration (Deeks, 2018; De Clercq, 2018) . Novel RT inhibitors such as islatravir and dapivirine are currently under development (Baeten et al., 2016; Nel et al., 2016; Nakata et al., 2007) . HIV protease plays an indispensable role in the proteolytic processing of Gag and Gagpol polyproteins to release key structural proteins (matrix, capsid, nucleocapsid, p6) and viral enzymes (reverse transcriptase, integrase, protease) . HIV protease is a homodimer of two subunits and the active site of HIV protease is located at the center of the substrate-binding tunnel. This substrate-binding tunnel has been recognized as a conserved drug-binding pocket for the development of HIV protease inhibitors to prevent proteolytic processing (Ko et al., 2010) . As of September 2020, 10 protease inhibitors have been approved by the US FDA. The era of protease inhibitors began in 1995 when saquinavir was the first protease inhibitor approved for clinical use. Subsequently, the US FDA approved ritonavir (a protease inhibitor and pharmacokinetic booster) in 1996, indinavir in 1996, nelfinavir in 1997, amprenavir in 1999, lopinavir and atazanavir in 2000, fosamprenavir in 2003, tipranavir in 2005, and darunavir in 2006 . Over the past decades, HIV protease inhibitors have become an important ingredient of HAART (Hammer et al., 1997; Gulick et al., 1997) . Nevertheless, the rapid emergence of resistance and poor bioavailability pose a challenge to the clinical use of protease inhibitors (Subbaiah et al., 2017) . Currently, darunavir is the most popular protease inhibitor (Deeks, 2014) , while saquinavir and amprenavir have been virtually discontinued . HIV integrase, encoded by the HIV Pol gene, is an indispensable enzyme for integrating viral DNA genomes into human chromosomes by a series of DNA cutting and joining reactions (Asante-Appiah and Skalka, 1999; Esposito and Craigie, 1999) . Since the viral DNA synthesized by HIV reverse transcriptase is initially blunt-ended, there are two critical steps of viral integration: (1) the 3 0 end processing reaction removes two nucleotides from each of the 3 0 ends of the viral dsDNA before viral integration; and (2) the DNA strand transfer reaction that breaks the human chromosome and 3 0 ends of viral DNA are joined to the 5 0 ends of human chromosome at the integration sites (Li et al., 2015) . Antiviral compounds have been screened to inhibit either the 3 0 end processing reaction or the DNA strand transfer reaction (Delelis et al., 2008) . Compounds against the 3 0 end processing reaction are inactive, but integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have shown potent antiviral activities in both in vitro and in vivo studies (Delelis et al., 2008) . INSTIs selectively bind near the 3 0 end of the viral DNA in the structural complex of viral DNA and HIV integrase, thereby blocking the DNA strand transfer reaction (Delelis et al., 2008) . As of September 2020, four INSTIs (raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir) have been approved by the US FDA. The first-generation INSTIs such as raltegravir and elvitegravir share a low genetic barrier to resistance, causing the loss of virologic activity in clinical studies (Brooks et al., 2019) . In contrast, dolutegravir and bictegravirtwo second-generation INSTIsexhibit a higher genetic barrier to resistance, limited cross-resistance, and less drug-drug interactions Podany et al., 2017) . Currently, the WHO, IAS-USA, and EACS guidelines recommend the use of INSTIs in the first-line HIV regimens (Brooks et al., 2019) . Novel INSTIs such as cabotegravir are undergoing clinical development (Orkin et al., 2020) . GP41 is a transmembrane protein encoded by the env gene. As a key structure protein, HIV GP41 binds with GP120 to form HIV spike trimers on the surface of HIV particles (Mao et al., 2012) . During the viral entry, the N-heptad repeat (NHR) and C-heptad repeat (CHR) of GP41 switch to a six-helix bundle (6-HB) structure which binds to the human cell membrane and drives the viral fusion into the human cells. Many antiviral agents have been developed to target the hydrophobic pocket within the NHR trimer, therefore preventing viral entry (Mostashari Rad et al., 2018) . As the only GP41 inhibitor approved by the US FDA, enfuvirtide is a fusion peptide inhibitor that mimics the N-heptad repeat and prevents the formation of the six-helix bundle structure of GP41. Clinical use of enfuvirtide requires twice-daily subcutaneous injection (90 mg/Kg for adults, 2 mg/Kg for children aged 6-16 years) (Kitchen et al., 2008) . Enfuvirtide is not commonly used in clinical practice because of its side effects (eosinophilia, neutropenia, increased risk of bacterial pneumonia), its short half-life, and lack of oral availability (Reust, 2011). Although many attempts have been made, the development of GP41 inhibitors remains difficult due to the emerging mutations and structural dynamics of HIV GP41. GP120, encoded by the env gene, is an envelope glycoprotein on the surface of HIV particles. During the viral entry, HIV GP120 binds to the CD4 receptor and the CCR5/CXCR4 co-receptor on the surface of human CD4 þ T cells (Falkenhagen and Joshi, 2018; Shaik et al., 2019) . The Phe43 pocket and other conserved regions on the GP120 are considered as the real targets for developing anti-HIV drugs (Mostashari Rad et al., 2018) . The drugs targeting GP120 can be called adhesion inhibitors, mainly blocking the binding of GP120 with CD4 (Pu et al., 2019) . Fostemsavir (BMS-663068) is the first GP120-directed attachment inhibitor approved by the US FDA on July 3rd, 2020. Fostemsavir tromethamine is the prodrug of temsavirthe active moiety that binds to the conserved outer domain of GP120 which is adjacent to the CD4 binding loop (Langley et al., 2015) . This binding inhibits the exposure of the chemokine co-receptor binding site and prevents the initial interaction of HIV GP120 with the CD4 receptor on human T cells and other immune cells (Langley et al., 2015) . Fostemsavir is recommended for heavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infections. As the only compound in the class of GP120 drugs, fostemsavir harbors a unique resistance profile and exhibits no cross-resistance with other entry inhibitors (Lataillade et al., 2018) . HCV NS3/4A Protease The nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) contains a serine protease domain and a helicase domain at the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, respectively (McGivern et al., 2015) . The NS3 protein acts as a serine protease to cleave HCV polyprotein precursor at four junctions (NS3-NS4A, NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B) to release 5 viral proteins. As a short 54-amino-acid polypeptide, the nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) serves as an essential co-factor for the NS3 serine protease in a non-covalent complex. NS3 protease is an attractive drug target because its inhibition can terminate the polyprotein processing and restore interferon gene expression (McGivern et al., 2015) . NS3/4A protease inhibitors are a key element of direct-acting antivirals that effectively cure HCV infections by targeting one or more viral proteins (Li and De Clercq, 2017) . As of today, ten NS3/4A protease inhibitors have been approved, including glecaprevir, grazoprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, vaniprevir, voxilaprevir, asunaprevir, danoprevir, boceprevir (discontinued), and telaprevir (discontinued) (Li and De Clercq, 2017) . Moreover, danoprevir was approved in China to treat patients infected with HCV genotype 1b (Miao et al., 2020) . Novel NS3/4A inhibitors such as seraprevir are currently under development. For instance, seraprevir is now evaluated in a phase 3 trial (NCT04001608). The nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a zinc-binding and proline-rich hydrophilic phosphoprotein that executes versatile functions in genome replication, viral particle assembly, and human-virus interactions (Ross-Thriepland and Harris, 2015). The NS5A protein in the form of a dimer or multimer localizes to the ER-derived membranes via its amphipathic helix domain. NS5A inhibitors can target the amphipathic helix domain of NS5A dimer to inhibit the conformation of double-membrane vesicles and impair HCV RNA replication factories (Shanmugam et al., 2018) . As of today, six NS5A inhibitors (ombitasvir, elbasvir, velpatasvir, daclatasvir, ledipasvir, pibrentasvir) have been approved by the US FDA. These NS5A inhibitors efficiently block in vitro and in vivo viral replication, though their exact models of drug actions are yet to be elucidated (Ross-Thriepland and Harris, 2015) . Moreover, the clinical efficacy of NS5A inhibitors plus other directacting antivirals offers more than 90% of sustained virologic responses (Li and De Clercq, 2017) . Many experimental NS5A inhibitors such as ravidasvir are still under development. Ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir offered promising virologic response rates in 298 patients infected with HCV genotype 4 (Esmat et al., 2017) . The nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is indispensable for HCV RNA synthesis and genome replication. The structure of NS5B consists of three subdomains: ""palm"", ""finger"", ""thumb"", and the hydrophobic membrane anchoring C-terminus. As a promising drug target, the catalytic site of NS5B is encircled by the finger and thumb domains. NS5B inhibitors that alter structural conformation or interfere with viral RNA binding exhibit promising potency to inhibit HCV RNA replication (Kirby et al., 2015) . Two NS5B inhibitors have been approved by the US FDA, including sofosbuvir (GS-7977; formerly PSI-7977) in December 2013 and dasabuvir (ABT-333) in December 2014. The NS5B inhibitors can be mainly divided into either nucleoside inhibitors (e.g., sofosbuvir) or non-nucleoside inhibitors (e.g., dasabuvir) (Li and De Clercq, 2017) . On the one hand, nucleoside inhibitors block the viral RNA synthesis by mimicking natural substrates and competing with incoming nucleoside triphosphates at the catalytic site of NS5B (Li and De Clercq, 2017) . On the other hand, non-nucleotide inhibitors noncompetitively block the allosteric pockets outside the catalytic site to prevent viral RNA synthesis (Li and De Clercq, 2017) . For instance, dasabuvir (Kati et al., 2015) , GSK5852 (Voitenleitner et al., 2013) , beclabuvir (Gentles et al., 2014) , and filibuvir (Fenaux et al., 2013) target the allosteric drug pockets in the palm I, palm II, thumb I, and thumb II domains, respectively. Although only two NS5B inhibitors have been approved, many novel NS5B inhibitors (e.g., beclabuvir) are still under development. RSV RNA Polymerase RSV RNA-dependent RNA polymerasea complex comprising the viral large polymerase subunit, the phosphoprotein, and the transcription elongation factor M2-1plays a critical role in viral mRNA transcription, mRNA capping/methylation, and genome replication (Fearns and Deval, 2016) . The large polymerase subunit harbors the enzymatic domains that produce subgenomic mRNAs, RNA replication, and an antigenome RNA for genome RNA synthesis, while the other proteins act as essential cofactors (Fearns and Deval, 2016) . Due to its unique features and essential nature, the large polymerase protein has proved to be a promising drug target for the development of nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors. As of today, ribavirin is an FDA-approved nucleoside inhibitor that inhibits the activity of RSV RdRp, whereas it is largely discontinued to treat RSV infections due to limited efficacy and risk of serious side effects (Shook and Lin, 2017) . Experimental inhibitors such as ALS-8176 and PC786 are still under clinical development. ALS-8176 (lumicitabine) is a nucleoside inhibitor with promising anti-RSV efficacy and safety in phase 2a study (NCT02094365) (DeVincenzo et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015) . PC786 is a potent non-nucleoside inhibitor that blocks RSV type A strains (IC 50 : o0.09-0.71 nM) and RSV type B strains (IC 50 : 1.3-50.6 nM) in cell cultures (Coates et al., 2017) . RSV fusion glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein that anchors in the membrane of viral particles via a transmembrane domain (Gilman et al., 2019) . During the viral entry, RSV fusion glycoprotein in the trimeric form is undergoing dramatic changes from the metastable prefusion confirmation to the highly stable post-fusion conformation, thereby driving the fusion of viral membrane with the human cell membranes (Gilman et al., 2019) . RSV fusion glycoprotein that induces RSV-neutralizing antibody responses is a key antigen for protective immunity (Tang et al., 2019) . As a leading target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines, RSV fusion glycoproteins have conserved sequences across different isolates of RSV type A and B strains (Tang et al., 2019) . As of September 2020, palivizumab that binds to RSV fusion glycoprotein remains the only monoclonal antibody approved for the prevention of RSV infection in high-risk infants. Nevertheless, the clinical application of palivizumab is uncommon because of its low stability and its limited efficacy of 50% (Soto et al., 2020) . Ongoing studies are currently evaluating many experimental inhibitors of RSV fusion glycoprotein, including preatovir, ziresovir, sisunatovir, MDT-637, JNJ-53718678, and ALX-0171. For instance, preatovir (GS-5806) efficiently inhibits the fusion glycoprotein of RSV-A (EC 50 : 0.51 7 0.25 nM) and RSV-B (EC 50 : 0.35 7 0.15 nM) strains in cell cultures (Perron et al., 2015) , and it has completed clinical phase 2 trials (NCT02135614). Ziresovir is another selective and orally bioavailable inhibitor in phase 3 clinical trial (NCT04231968) (Zheng et al., 2019) . HSV DNA Polymerase UL30 HSV DNA replication requires seven viral proteins: (1) an origin binding protein UL9, (2) a single-strand binding protein ICP8; (3) a viral polymerase with two subunits UL30 and UL42; (iv) a helicase-primase complex with three subunits UL5, UL8, and UL52 (Chen et al., 2011) . HSV DNA polymerase is a heterodimeric complex with two subunits: (1) the catalytic UL30 subunit which offers both polymerase and proofreading exonuclease activities; (2) the UL42 subunit that promotes processivity by tethering UL30 to viral DNA via its direct DNA binding (Vashishtha and Kuchta, 2015) . The UL30 subunit belongs to the B-family of polymerases and forms a typical hand-shaped structure with the catalytic residues (D717, D888) located in the palm domain for dNTP polymerization (Vashishtha and Kuchta, 2015) . The UL30 subunit can replicate viral DNA with high fidelity, even in the absence of the UL42 subunit. Due to its indispensable role, the UL30 subunit has been considered as a promising drug target to block viral DNA replication (Zarrouk et al., 2017) . As of September 2020, many UL30 inhibitors such as idoxuridine, brivudine, trifluridine foscarnet, aciclovir, famciclovir, valaciclovir, and penciclovir have been approved for HSV treatment. Because current compounds face the challenge of drug resistance and adverse reactions (Vollmer et al., 2019) , many experimental inhibitors such as synguanol (Vollmer et al., 2019) , mitoxantrone dihydrochloride (Huang et al., 2019) , and PHA767491 (Hou et al., 2017) are under development. For instance, synguanol is a methylenecyclopropane nucleoside analog that competitively inhibits HSV-1 UL30 (IC 50 : 0.33 7 0.16 mM) (Vollmer et al., 2019) . Mitoxantrone dihydrochloride inhibits viral DNA synthesis by blocking the transcription of UL30 (IC 50 : 1.21 mM) (Huang et al., 2019) . PHA767491 also inhibits UL30 to reduce the expression of HSV viral genes (UL5, UL8, UL29, UL30, UL42, UL52) (IC 50 : 1.86 mM) (Hou et al., 2017) . Antiviral agents such as pritelivir and amenamevir that target HSV helicaseprimase complex are still under development (Poole and James, 2018) . Although HSV particles harbor at least 15 envelope proteins, four envelope glycoproteins (gD, gB, gH, gL) play an indispensable role in viral entry into all permissive cell types (Agelidis and Shukla, 2015) . The viral entry begins with the binding of gD to a human receptor (nectin-1, herpesvirus entry mediator, or 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate) (Atanasiu et al., 2018) . This gD-receptor binding drives the conformation changes in gD to activate the regulatory proteins gH and gL, leading to the activation of gB into a fusogenic state for membrane fusion (Agelidis and Shukla, 2015) . Docosanol (n-docosanol; behenyl alcohol) is a naturally occurring antiherpetic agent approved by the US FDA as a topical treatment for herpes labialis, as well as the over-the-counter medication for cold sores and fever blisters . Although its exact mechanism of action remains unclear, docosanol may inhibit the interactions between HSV envelope proteins and human receptors . Experimental inhibitors such as C19 and NGI-1 are still under development (Rinis et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2019) . HCMV DNA polymerase is a multiprotein complex that contains a catalytic subunit UL54 and a processivity factor UL44 to synthesize long stretches of viral DNA during viral replication (Appleton et al., 2004) . The homodimer UL44 binds to viral DNA to prevent dissociation from the template, thereby promoting the long-chain DNA synthesis within the catalytic subunit of UL54 (Appleton et al., 2004) . Due to its essential role in viral DNA synthesis, UL54 has been recognized as an important drug target against HCMV. As of today, cidofovir, ganciclovir, foscarnet, valganciclovir, and fomivirsen (discontinued) have been approved for HCMV treatment. To inhibit viral DNA synthesis, cidofovir and ganciclovir are converted to DNA polymerase substrate analogs by the thymidine kinase of CMV. UL54 gene is prone to mutations that limit the efficiency of antiviral agents (Chou et al., 2016) . Furthermore, cidofovir may induce nephrotoxicity especially in bone marrow transplant patients , which limits its clinical use. Novel compounds such as CMX001 (brincidofovir) are currently under development. CMX001 can be converted to cidofovir. The drug potency is much higher for CMX001 than for cidofovir. Cidofovir from CMX001 does not accumulate in the kidneys, therefore nephrotoxicity could be greatly reduced during the treatment (Marty et al., 2013) . HCMV DNA terminase complex is a hetero-oligomer composed of UL56, UL89, and additional viral subunits (UL51, UL52, UL77, UL93) (Ligat et al., 2018) . This terminase complex cleaves HCMV DNA concatemers and packages the genome into the capsid for the DNA-packing process during the viral maturation and packaging (Ligat et al., 2018) . The large terminase subunit UL56 plays an essential role in the viral DNA cleavage and packaging (Ligat et al., 2018) . UL56 not only has the ATPase activity that hydrolyzes ATP to provide energy for the genome cutting and transfer activities but also has ATP-independent endonuclease activity driven by UL89 (Ligat et al., 2018) . As an indispensable viral protein, UL65 has been considered to be a promising drug target. As of September 2020, letermovir remains the only UL56 inhibitor approved by the US FDA for preventing HCMV in adult HCMVseropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Based on a phase 3 clinical trial (NCT02137772), letermovir prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of HCMV infection, and its adverse effects were mild (Marty et al., 2017) . Moreover, letermovir is a viral DNA-packaging inhibitor, remarkably specific for HCMV, but not other herpesviruses (Ligat et al., 2018) . The influenza polymerase is comprised of polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), plus either polymerase acidic protein (PA) in influenza A/B or polymerase 3 protein (P3) in influenza C/D viruses (Takashita, 2020) . The PB1 subunit encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, while the PA and PB2 subunits offer the endonuclease and cap-binding activities, respectively (Wandzik et al., 2020) . During the transcription of viral mRNA, the cap-snatching of capped oligomers from human Pol II transcripts is mediated by the PB2 cap-binding and PA endonuclease activities. Subsequently, the PB1 active site undertakes the prime template-directed RNA synthesis, followed by the initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling of typical polymerase activities (Wandzik et al., 2020) . Due to their importance, PA, PB1, and PB2 have been considered as promising antiviral targets. As of September 2020, the PA inhibitor baloxavir marboxil (S-033188) and the PB1 inhibitor favipiravir (T-705) have been approved for clinical use, while the PB2 inhibitor pimodivir (JNJ-63623872, VX-787) is currently evaluated in phase 3 trials (NCT03381196, NCT03376321). As a pyrazine derivative, favipiravir received conditional marketing approval only for patients with a novel or reemerging influenza when other antivirals are ineffective because favipiravir increases the risk for teratogenicity and embryotoxicity (Takashita, 2020) . Baloxavir marboxil was approved for treating influenza A and B viruses, while its pattern of drug susceptibility follows the order: influenza A > B > C > D (Takashita, 2020) . As a cyclohexyl carboxylic acid analog, pimodivir inhibits viral RNA binding by occupying the cap-binding domain of PB2, and it shows strong activity against influenza A but not B viruses (Takashita, 2020) . Other novel polymerase inhibitors are still under development. Influenza surface glycoprotein neuraminidase is known for its multifunctional roles in viral entry and viral release. During the viral entry, the glycoprotein neuraminidase contributes to the viral binding to the sialic acid receptors of human cell glycoproteins, Elsulfavirine was approved in Russia, albuvirtide was approved in China; favipiravir and laninamivir were approved in Japan; danoprevir was approved in China; clevudine was approved in South Korea and the Philippines; besifovir was approved in South Korea. leading to the enhancement of hemagglutinin receptor binding (Wen and Wan, 2019) . During the viral release, neuraminidase cleaves sialic acids from cellular receptors and neuraminidase/hemagglutinin on nascent influenza virions so as to prevent virion aggregation and release new particles (McAuley et al., 2019) . Due to its importance, neuraminidase has been recognized as a promising antiviral target (Kumar et al., 2020) . As of September 2020, neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir have been approved for clinical use (Table 1) . Oseltamivir is used orally as the first-line therapy, but its effectiveness is compromised by the development of drug resistance mutations in influenza A genotypes such as H3N2 and H5N1 (Kumar et al., 2020) . Due to the emergence of drug resistance, it remains an urgent need to develop anti-influenza agents. Novel antivirals such as A-192558 and A-315675 are still under development (Gubareva and Mohan, 2020) . The influenza matrix protein 2 (M2) is a 97-residue single-pass membrane protein that forms pH-gated proton channels in the viral lipid envelope (Schnell and Chou, 2008) . By shuttling protons inwards and outwards through the viral membrane, matrix protein 2 equilibrates pH across the viral membrane during the viral entry and across the trans-Golgi membrane of host cells during the viral maturation (Mandala et al., 2020) . Because the channel pore is essential for the proton shuttling, the pore of the M2 channel is a promising drug-binding pocket (Gu et al., 2013) . As of September 2020, rimantadine and amantadine that target the M2 channel pore have been approved for anti-influenza treatment. For instance, amantadine targets the M2 channel by hydrophobic interactions between the adamantane group and the N-terminal gate of the channel (Gu et al., 2013) . Mutations (e.g., V27A, L26F) within the channel pore weaken the hydrophobic interactions of rimantadine and amantadine with the M2 channel, thereby causing drug resistance and treatment failure (Gu et al., 2013) . Novel inhibitors that are less prone to mutations may lead to better antiviral efficacy. The extinction of variola virus, the etiological agent of human smallpox was declared by the WHO in 1980 (Jordan et al., 2010) . The F13L gene of variola virus encodes a highly conserved 37 kDa peripheral membrane protein called VP37. Before the viral budding, the wrapping complex requires VP37 and other viral proteins to interact with human membrane proteins; subsequently, it catalyzes the maturation of intracellular viral particles into the egress-competent form of the variola virus particles (Jordan et al., 2010) . VP37 interacts with human proteins Rab9 and TIP47 (a Rab9-specific effector) in membrane fractions from infected cells to facilitate assembly of extracellular virus (Chen et al., 2009) . As of September 2020, tecovirimat (ST-246) remains the only VP37 inhibitor approved for treating human smallpox, although its effectiveness has only been shown in animal models but not humans due to the extinction of the virus in human populations. As an 4-trifluoromethyl phenol derivative, tecovirimat blocks the interactions of VP37 with Rab8 and TIP47, thereby inhibiting the maturation of egress-competent enveloped virions for viral budding (Jordan et al., 2010) . Novel compounds such as NIOCH-14 are still under development (Delaune and Iseni, 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by the NSP12 gene, forms a polymerase complex with its viral cofactors NSP7 and NSP8 to catalyze the viral RNA synthesis during the viral replication and transcription (Gao et al., 2020) . Similar to SARS-CoV polymerase, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase contains three subdomains: fingers, a thumb, and a palm, while the catalytic site (S759-D760-D761) is located within the conserved motifs of the palm domain (Gao et al., 2020) . The cofactors NSP7 and NSP8 interact with the thumb, while another NSP8 binds to the fingers, thereby conferring processivity to NSP12 (Hillen et al., 2020) . Due to its indispensable role in viral RNA replication, SARS-CoV-2 polymerase is an important target for antiviral drug development Zhou et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020) . As of October 2020, remdesivir (GS-5734) has been authorized in the US for clinical use as a polymerase inhibitor to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir acts as a delayed chain terminator to interfere with the RNA synthesis of viral polymerase and evades the proofreading of viral exoribonuclease (Eastman et al., 2020) . The intravenous use of remdesivir could shorten the recovery time and reduce the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 based on a randomized, double-blinded, placebocontrolled trial (NCT04280705) (Olalla, 2020) . Other novel experimental inhibitors such as GS-441524 (Yan and Muller, 2020) and favipiravir (Arab-Zozani et al., 2020) might offer antiviral activities against SARS-COV-2, but their clinical use requires further investigation. VZV DNA Polymerase VZV polymerase belongs to the DNA polymerase type-B family. As the essential component of VZV replication complex, DNA polymerase is encoded by the open reading frame 28 (ORF28). VZV DNA polymerase is an ideal target for the development of nucleoside analogs because it plays a critical role in viral DNA replication during the life cycle. As of September 2020, nucleoside analogs such as aciclovir, famciclovir, valaciclovir, brivudine, and vidarabine have been approved for VZV treatment . These compounds could effectively target VZV polymerase and block viral DNA synthesis. As a prodrug of penciclovir, famciclovir effectively prevents the recurrence of VZV, and it has only mild adverse events . Furthermore, both aciclovir and famciclovir interventions offer high rates of benefit and showed a similar time to full crusting of lesions (Pott Junior et al., 2018) . HBV DNA Polymerase HBV RNA-dependent DNA-dependent polymerase, encoded by the open reading frame P, acts with multifaceted functions such as (1) HBV reverse transcription that synthesizes the ( À ) DNA strand from the viral RNA template within the catalytic site of HBV polymerase; (2) degradation of the viral RNA template by the RNase H activity of HBV polymerase (Menendez-Arias et al., 2014) . HBV polymerase is mainly comprised of three functional domains: the template domain (AA positions: 1-183), the polymerase domain (349 À 691), and the RNase H domain (692 À 845) (Menendez-Arias et al., 2014) . The catalytic site of the polymerase domain is considered as a promising drug target, whilst nucleos(t)ide inhibitors have been developed to compete with the incorporation of natural nucleotide substrates into the elongating DNA chain, thereby blocking viral DNA synthesis . As of September 2020, many nucleos(t)ide inhibitors (entecavir, telbivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, tenofovir alafenamide, clevudine, and besifovir) have been approved for clinical use. Note that clevudine was only approved in South Korea and the Philippines, while besifovir was approved in South Korea. Despite the success of nucleos(t)ide inhibitors to suppress the viral replication, they do not eliminate the virus from the hepatocytes, and a cure of HBV infection remains yet to be discovered. Novel HBV polymerase inhibitors such as tenofovir exalidex are still under clinical development (Martinez et al., 2020) .@story_separate@Based on the classification of approved antiviral agents, several features could be summarized. First, antiviral agents mostly target the viral proteins with high specificity, leading to less toxicity compared with human protein targets. Second, among 9 infectious diseases, the most popular drug targets could be listed as follows: viral polymerase, viral envelope glycoproteins, and viral protease. These three viral proteins play a dispensable role in viral replication, making them promising viral targets for most human viruses. Third. antiviral agents are mostly small molecules that can be taken orally in clinical settings, while few antibodies and peptide inhibitors have been approved for antiviral use. Compared with monoclonal antibodies and peptides, small molecules are typically cheaper, chemically stabler, structurally simpler and better permeable. Although this article only describes 10 infectious diseases with approved drugs, future antiviral development should also focus on emerging infectious diseases such as coronaviruses, dengue, Zika, and Ebola. On October 14, 2020, the US FDA approved a mixture of three monoclonal antibodies (atoltivimab, maftivimab, odesivimab-ebgn), which marks the first FDA approval for the treatment of Ebola virus infection. Furthermore, it remains critical improving antivirals to combat emerging drug resistance mutations because drug resistance mutations have been observed in many viruses (e.g., HIV, HBV, influenza).","Over the past 60 years, more than 100 antiviral drugs or their combinations have been approved for clinical use. Antiviral drugs can be classified according to their chemical nature (e.g., small-molecules, peptides, biologics) or mechanisms of drug actions against specific viral proteins (e.g., polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, glycoprotein inhibitors). This article provides an overview of antiviral classifications in 10 important human viruses: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), variola virus (human smallpox), varicella zoster virus (VZV), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first detected during an investigation of an outbreak in Wuhan, China [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . This infectious disease has been spreading worldwide, and the World Health Organization declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [6] . As of June 2020, a total of 921 million confirmed cases and 476 thousand confirmed deaths in 216 countries/areas were noted and continue to increase. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected entire societies, including educational systems, in countries all around the world [7] [8] [9] . Since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was officially announced on 21 January 2020 [10, 11] , the educational system has been challenged to decide the critical cut-off for closure of face-to-face courses in schools. Given that schools share the same responsibilities as the rest of society and need to take precautions during the outbreak of diseases, efforts to prevent transmission of this coronavirus are critically important. Towards this end, we established and began execution of campus protection measures for COVID-19 (CPMCV-19) on 26 January 2020, 5 days after the announcement of the first confirmed case in Taiwan. This study was conducted in MacKay Junior College of Medicine, Nursing and Management, Taiwan. This school comprises about 4200 students aged between 16 and 20 years old. In the present study, we analyzed the effectiveness and cost in practicing the CPMCV-19 to provide informative statistics, as well as practical information, for other schools facing the challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.@story_separate@The selection of team members was mostly accomplished using existing personnel and operation designations within the original school structure. All department principal supervisors and selected secondary supervisors, 30 persons in total, were recruited and assigned to various task groups. The organization chart of this multidisciplinary task team is illustrated in Figure 1 . disease has been spreading worldwide, and the World Health Organization declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [6] .

The selection of team members was mostly accomplished using existing personnel and operation designations within the original school structure. All department principal supervisors and selected secondary supervisors, 30 persons in total, were recruited and assigned to various task groups. The organization chart of this multidisciplinary task team is illustrated in Figure 1 . The investigation was carried out following the rules of the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975. All the 30 persons involved had been informed of this study and manuscript, and their signed consent was obtained. The task team members established the campus protection measures according to the guidelines from Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) with timely updates. The details were further customized by team members from each unit. All protection measures were adjusted through a rolling correction mechanism. Team discussions were conducted through mobile application LINETM (LINE Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), institutional e-mail system, teleconferences, or face-to-face meetings. Event simulation was conducted for the development of countermeasures including detected fever, reported symptoms related to COVID-19, confirmed case on campus, and others. In order to efficiently and appropriately cope with the situation, we set up a decision-making algorithm including criteria for a 14-day school closure when 2 confirmed cases are reported within a 14-day period, as shown in Figure 2 . When students are unwell or have abnormal body temperature measurement, they must first seek medical attention, and then choose hospital isolation, home isolation, home quarantine, or self-health management according to the doctor's instructions and government regulations. The task team members established the campus protection measures according to the guidelines from Taiwan CDC with timely updates. The details were further customized by team members from each unit. All protection measures were adjusted through a rolling correction mechanism. Although a zero COVID-19 case record noted in campus cannot be entirely attributed to the performance of measures, we proposed that the established protection measures on campus might be useful and practical.  As shown in Table 1 , the essential components in established measures were as follows: no close contact communication (team telecommunication by using mobile application LINETM, administrative teleconference using Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Co., Redmond, WA, USA), teleteaching simulation by TronClass platform (Wisdom Garden Co., New Taipei City, Taiwan)), daily campus sterilization on workdays via 0.05% (500 ppm) sodium hypochlorite (cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces in the context of COVID-19: Interim guidance, 15 May 2020, World Health Organization), school gate control with daily temperature measuring (cut-off 37.5 • C by frontal temperature), social distancing (1.5-m indoors and 1-m outdoors), activity restrictions (100 persons indoors and 500 persons outdoors), personal hygiene control (facemasks, handwashing education, desktop sneeze guards in classrooms and restaurants), and situational awareness (regulations and standard operating procedures, as well as execution analysis). Official announcements to students and parents were promptly posted on the school website. An example is listed in Appendix A. Situational awareness Regulations and standard operating procedures, as well as execution analysis. As shown in Table 2 , when our school faced the outbreak of COVID-19, the epidemic prevention measures and actions taken, with a total of 21 regulations, standard operating procedures, and decision-making algorithms were established. After rolling corrections, the finalized decision-making algorithms are shown in Figure 2 .  During the 100 days of operation (from 26 January to 5 June 2020), the mean time spent for frontal temperature measuring was 2.7 ± 0.3 s per person. The mean on-duty time for individual personnel to control the gate and measure temperature was 3.5 h per day. In total, 31 persons with loss of taste/smell or fever were detected on campus and sent to the hospital for screening within 1 hour. A total of 6 persons were instructed to observe self-health management due to possible contact or travel history, and none were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Cancellation of 32 school activities with teleconferences held as alternatives successfully avoided physical contact for 14,400 person-times. A total budget of USD 27,100 was used for CMPCV-19 in this 100-day period. This budget was mainly used to purchase items needed for epidemic prevention including forehead temperature detectors, masks, alcohol, detergents, disinfectants, and the like. The administrative teleconferences using Microsoft Teams were held 3 times, for an accumulated time of 7 h in total. The teleteaching simulations by TronClass platform were performed twice, with a combined time of 6 h. The timely established campus protection measures for COVID-19 in an approximate 5000-person college were effective and practical. They can be used as reference for schools in a pandemic, such as COVID-19. Since the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan, the medical and educational institutions have established various strategies for preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases and proposed response mechanisms for distributing resources efficiently during management operations [12, 13] . The experience in responding to SARS with a 17-year interval aided the rapid response to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic in educational institutions. However, the viral characters of COVID-19 are distinct to SARS. For instance, the longer latency made campus protection from case clustering a vigorous challenge. Notably, a longer incubation time for SARS-CoV-2 infection with mean time 5.2 days (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.1 to 7.0) and the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days [14] , indicated a need to adjust screening and control policies. It was suggested that potentially exposed subjects are required to be isolated for 14 days to avoid the risk of further transmission. As for symptoms/signs other than fever, loss of taste or loss of smell with severity greater than moderate were reported in 37.2% of patients positive for COVID-19 [15] . Taken together, we established the campus protection measures for COVID-19 by combining the experience from SARS and updating the information for COVID-19. The major value of this work is to provide a timely reference for schools with similar scale to establish their own campus protection measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. The limitations of this work are that no actual positive COVID-19 cases were detected in the campus and no long-term follow-up data could be provided. The uniqueness of this work is the combination of global COVID-19 situation, government infectious disease control policy, and college campus environment to establish protection measures that are timely and practical for execution. To the best of our knowledge, no such timely and well-organized measures have yet been published about the COVID-19 pandemic. To assess the execution efficiency of the campus protection measures, the following must be considered: efficacy, time consumption, costs, and labor. The performance of CPMCV-19 resulted in avoidance of physical contact in a significant quantity and rapid processing for fever or symptom-detected individuals by spending reasonable costs of budget, time and labor, indicative of effective and practical measures for campus protection. These execution results not only provide physical protection but also psychological disburden for campus crisis and human stress [16] [17] [18] . Follow procedures and regulations set by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control: A. Inform the school and observe a 14-day home quarantine if you have recently traveled to Hubei Province, China. B. If you have recently traveled to Mainland China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and have a fever or respiratory symptoms, please call the Disease Prevention Hotline 1922 and see a physician as soon as possible. If the physician deems no further medical action is necessary, please conduct self-health management for 14 days and refrain from leaving your home. C. Further regulations and amendments set by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control should be followed. Temperature should be taken daily. If your temperature exceeds the limit (forehead 37.5 • C/inner ear 38 • C), please visit a physician immediately. To prevent cross infection at school, abide the physician's orders for home rest or self-observation if needed. Take your temperature daily; wash your hands often; do not talk while eating. It is also recommended that you have an extra surgical mask with you at all times. 4. Avoid public places and hospitals if possible. Wash your hands often with either bar or liquid soap for a duration of 20 s or more each time. To properly prevent the spread of the virus and protect the health of our students, students are required to have their temperature taken once they arrive at school. If the temperature is under the limit (forehead 37.5 • C/inner ear 38 • C), the students are required to record the results on the class chart. If a student's temperature exceeds the limit, they will be asked to rest in an isolation area for a short period of time before their temperature is taken again. If the temperature is still too high, his/her parents will be notified to pick up their child, and a physician visit will be strongly recommended. Sorry for any inconvenience, and we appreciate your understanding. 6. All visitors (including parents) will be required to have their temperature taken, hands sanitized with alcohol, and have a mask on. Noncompliance, a temperature greater or equal to the limit (forehead 37.5 • C/inner ear 38 • C), or any respiratory symptoms will be cause for banning entry to the school. If you have any questions, please contact our school's Environmental Safety and Health Center at +886-2858-4180 (ext. 2153).@story_separate@The established campus protection measures for COVID-19 was practical and might be effective. However, it may need adjustments according to local culture and social characteristics. It may serve as a useful template for other colleges and small institutions that have limited resources. The COVID-19 virus has become a global pandemic with an infectious incubation period of 14 days. With confirmed foreign and domestic cases rising daily, our school faculty has established a dedicated task force and prepared related supplies for use when needed. School grounds are also sanitized on a regular basis. To ensure the health and well-being of our students and faculty, please adhere to the following regulations while this pandemic is in force:","To prevent transmission of the coronavirus, we established the campus protection measures for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (CPMCV-19) and analyzed the effectiveness and cost in practice. This project was set in Taiwan. We organized an anti-epidemic task force team from multidisciplinary co-workers to establish the CPMCV-19. The essential components were as follows: no close contact communication, sterilization, temperature control, social distancing, activity restrictions, personal hygiene control, and situational awareness. During 100 days of operation, the mean time spent for frontal temperature measuring was 2.7 ± 0.3 s per person. The mean on-duty time for individual personnel to control the gate and measure temperature was 3.5 h per day. In total, 31 persons with loss of taste/smell or fever were detected on campus and sent to hospital for screening within 1 h. A total of 6 persons were instructed to observe self-health management due to possible contact or travel history, and none were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. A total budget of USD 27,100 was used for CMPCV-19 in this period. The established campus protection measures for COVID-19 were practical and might be effective. They can be used as reference for schools in a pandemic, such as COVID-19."
"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic constitutes an unprecedented sanitary emergency that continues to pose a major challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. As of late July 2020, seven months after the emergence of the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in the city of Wuhan, People's Republic of China, approximately 600,000 deaths have occurred due to COVID-19 worldwide, with over 14 million cases reported in 219 countries and territories [1] . In Germany, over 200,000 cases have been reported so far [2] . This has led to the update and implementation of the National Pandemic Plan, a series of infection prevention and control strategies that have been adapted and applied by each Federal State according to local conditions [3, 4] . In spite of initial controversy, current evidence indicates that person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs through contact (direct and indirect), droplets, and (indoor) aerosols [5] . In addition, the newest reports describe a previously unknown transplacental transmission [6] . These multiple mechanisms, along with an infectious dose estimated to be similar or lower to that of SARS-CoV-1 and the possibility of infectivity within the incubation period, show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread potential [7, 8] . Considering the current lack of vaccines and antiviral drugs for causal treatment, infection prevention and control strategies represent the cornerstone of health interventions aimed at tackling the pandemic [5] . It is widely known that the healthcare setting offers optimal conditions for the spread of viral agents. Several factors contribute to this, such as the close interaction between patients and healthcare workers (HCWs), as well as the increased susceptibility of immunocompromised patients and the nature of certain medical procedures that may enhance the risk of exposure [9, 10] . Reports which originated from previous coronavirus epidemics in recent decades offer valuable information for estimating the potential nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2. Evidence from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics indicates that, while these viral agents may differ in their exposure and transmission patterns, large nosocomial outbreaks of both agents were usually preceded by super-spreading events caused by the delayed diagnosis of index cases [11] . During the 2002/2003 SARS pandemic, a highly efficient transmission in the hospital setting was documented for this agent, with nosocomial spreading events being identified as responsible for the amplification and propagation of the pandemic [12] . Furthermore, unrecognized cases of patients displaying few or unspecific symptoms triggered nosocomial outbreaks in several countries [12] . Similarly, unsuspected infections represent a significant challenge in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as indicated by reports of nosocomial spread originated from cases not identified upon admission [13, 14] or undiagnosed HCWs [15] . Moreover, infectivity of patients within the incubation period further hampers appropriate contact tracing and prompt implementation of control measures [14, 16, 17] . The present study sheds light on the nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of a large university hospital in Germany, focusing on the role of undetected cases among patients and HCWs. Moreover, the study aims to identify strategies for effective resource management and infection control measures useful to minimize nosocomial transmission at different stages of the pandemic.@story_separate@The University Hospital Münster (UHM) is a tertiary care center with 1500 beds (80 in intensive care units, 43 in intermediate care units, IMC). The UHM admits 62,000 patients yearly, a number which has decreased by approximately 40% during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is located in the Federal State of North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW), in the northwest of Germany. During the first wave of the pandemic in mid-March, SARS-CoV-2 incidence peaked at 5.8 and 6.0 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in NRW and Germany, respectively. Following the nationwide lockdown measures, these values decreased to 0.1 and 0.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in May, respectively [2] . In response to growing infection cases, several measures were adopted at our hospital. Tests were carried out following the national case definition and testing strategy centrally defined by the German Public Health Authority [18, 19] . These recommendations were implemented accordingly at different stages of the pandemic. Further measures and protocols were established internally at the UHM. In particular, the emergency department was forced to adopt processes for COVID-19 patients quickly. For this reason, new isolation capacities, the use of shipping containers for outpatient testing and a new COVID-19 ward including 32 IMC isolation rooms were established [20] . Furthermore, occupation in normal wards was limited to two patients per room, visitor access was restricted to a minimum (e.g., relatives of terminal patients) and working trips of all employees outside of the city were forbidden. Enhanced infection control measures were planned for confirmed and suspect cases, including isolation in COVID-19 wards and use of personal protective equipment (gloves, gowns, FFP2 masks and safety goggles). SARS-CoV-2 testing was started in the beginning of February at the UHM, receiving the first positive test result in the end of February. On March 20th the first nosocomial outbreak took place in the UHM in a pediatric dialysis unit [15] . Thereafter, wearing surgical masks was obligatory for every HCW in the UHM. After the first wave of infections, in the beginning of May, a questionnaire identifying potential COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors was introduced to detect potentially infected inpatients upon admission (for exact timeline see also Figure 1 ). In the context of this study, index persons were defined as inpatients or HCWs tested positively for SARS-CoV-2 and having contact with patients or HCWs without adequate contact precautions. Contact persons were defined as persons having contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs or patients within 48 h prior to the positive test result and without personal protection. Protection was assumed if personal protective equipment (including FFP2 masks) was worn during contact with the infected person. Contact persons were defined infected, if SARS-CoV-2 was detected within 14 days after unprotected contact via nasopharyngeal swab sample.  Testing was performed immediately following clinical diagnosis, with results being available within 24 h. SARS-CoV-2 was detected employing the Rotor-Gene Q platform (QIAGEN N.V., Venlo, Netherlands), targeting two separate genes via real-time RT-PCR as described previously [21] . Detection of envelope (E) gene was used as a screening test and detection of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene was used for confirmation. The threshold cycle value (C t -value), which is inversely proportional to the viral load, was documented for every SARS-CoV-2 positive index patient. Epidemiological data of suspect cases were collected upon testing, including information on symptoms, travel history and contact to confirmed cases or infection clusters. Contact tracing was carried out using data centrally stored in the hospital's patient management software and complemented with phone interviews when appropriate. Data are given as absolute numbers or percentages, if not stated otherwise. Attack rates, an indication of the proportion of subjects becoming infected among a group exposed to an index case [22] were calculated by dividing the number of exposed infected by the number of total exposed persons, in both outbreak settings only (= outbreak attack rate) and overall persons (= overall attack rate) using Microsoft Excel ® . From February to July 2020, 7760 HCWs, inpatients and outpatients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of which in total 357 persons were positive (Figure 1 ). According to the above-mentioned criteria, 27 index cases of hospital-associated SARS-CoV-2 infection could be identified and were followed up to investigate any further transmission in the hospital. Of these cases, 23 were HCWs and four were incidentally detected inpatients, who were asymptomatic on admission. Clinical characteristics of these index persons while tested are summarized in Table 1 . In total, 913 contact cases could be identified (428 patients and 485 HCWs), of whom in total four patients and eight HCWs were infected, respectively, during a nosocomial outbreak on a pediatric hemodialysis unit in early March. All 23 infected HCWs were put under home quarantine and underwent two SARS-CoV-2 tests before resuming work. Infected patients were isolated following infection control measures recommended by German Public Health authority [23] . Subsequently, no additional healthcare-associated infection or positive SARS-CoV-2 test in a contact person was detected. C t -values of index persons ranged from 17.96 to 41.07 ( Table 1 ). The total outbreak attack rate was 25.5% (20.0% for patients and 29.6% for HCWs), while the overall attack rate was only 1.3% (0.9% for patients and 1.6% for HCWs).  During the current COVID-19 pandemic, preventing nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission is one of the major challenges for hospitals. From an infection control point of view, two entities of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals pose the greatest risk as source of transmission in the healthcare setting: SARS-CoV-2 positive patients before diagnosis and SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs who are not yet aware of their infection. While the overall attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher for HCWs, HCWs represented the majority of our index cases. As part of our study, we reviewed the case history of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs. Transmission outside the hospital setting was the main source of infection for HCWs. This could be explained by the prevailing epidemiological conditions in the region, with the Federal State of North-Rhine Westphalia, in which the UHM is located, being one of the most affected by the pandemic in Germany [2] . In view of this challenging epidemiological context, the prompt establishment and implementation of occupational health policies aimed at the early detection and control of cases was shown to be instrumental in identifying infected hospital staff thus preventing further spread. Evidence regarding attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting is scarce. However, the attack rate in our hospital was low (1%) and below the values reported in several transmission events, ranging from 4 to 100% [24] [25] [26] [27] . By early March, the UHM had established several infection control measures that might have contributed towards this result, including the use of facemasks in common areas, reduction in bed occupancy, and restriction of the number of visitors. Interestingly, no nosocomial outbreak occurred since facemasks were mandatory at the UHM. In addition, each patient admitted to the UHM was assessed for SARS-CoV-2-associated symptoms or contact to SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with the help of a standardized questionnaire. This allowed for the rapid identification of any history of contact to positive cases or symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2, enabling the implementation of adequate contact precautions upon admission. Although the C t values of two index cases were identical, suggesting similar viral loads, only one index case caused a nosocomial outbreak. This observation highlights the complexity of superspreading events. This concept was previously applied in the context of the 2003 SARS epidemic in order to describe the infection of numerous persons by one single infected patient. The occurrence of such events in healthcare centers led to the revision and strict implementation of infection control measures in order to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-1 [28, 29] . While a high viral load is one contributing factor, there are also behavioral and environmental factors, such as social contacts of the infected individual. In total, 23 of 27 SARS-CoV-2 index persons were HCWs, indicating their role as important link in the introduction of this pathogen from the community into the enclosed hospital setting. The attack rate was higher among HCWs than among patients, while the C t -value, an indirect indicator for disease progression [30] , remained similar in both groups. This could be due to higher mobility of HCWs as compared to patients. The close interaction between HCWs during shifts could also be of relevance, especially in situations in which keeping the recommended minimum safe distance is not possible due to structural or logistical limitations. Additional HCW interaction outside the hospital should also be taken into consideration in explaining this phenomenon. There are some limitations regarding the present study. Our sample size is relatively small and comprises only monocentric data. Differences in the C t values and attack rates between both HCWs and patients might be detected by analyzing larger samples from different hospitals. Furthermore, although person-to-person contact is the best described mechanism of transmission, exposed persons may become infected through alternate modes such as contact with contaminated environments and indoor air contamination via aerosols. This interesting question should be addressed in future studies to identify the contribution of different transmission modes to the overall attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting. Variation in host susceptibility results might also influence infection rates and disease progression, but was not determined here due to the epidemiological nature of the study.@story_separate@Undiagnosed HCWs are key in the importation of SARS-CoV-2 into the hospital setting, and show a greater spread potential than patients at similar levels of infectivity. The introduction of unsuspected infected patients and HCWs cannot be fully avoided in the context of a pandemic. In our experience, further transmission within the hospital can be significantly minimized by implementing anamnestic assessment of patients upon admission as well as timely reporting, testing and quarantine for both patients and HCWs.","During the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, healthcare systems worldwide have to prevent nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission while maintaining duty of care. In our study, we characterize the transmission dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 in inpatients and healthcare workers (HCWs) at the University Hospital Münster (UHM) in northwest Germany. We identified 27 cases of healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections (4 inpatients and 23 HCWs) who had contact with patients and/or HCWs without the use of adequate PPE. The contacts of these index cases were followed up for SARS-CoV-2 infection after unprotected exposure and a quantitative measure of probability of becoming infected, the attack rate, was calculated. In addition, transmission was evaluated in the context of infection control measures established during the pandemic and we compared the epidemiological data of all index cases, including symptoms and C(t) values of virology test results. The overall attack rate in the hospital setting was 1.3% (inpatients 0.9%, HCWs 1.6%). However, during an outbreak, the attack rate was 25.5% (inpatients 20.0%, HCWs 29.6%). For both scenarios, HCWs had a higher attack rate illustrating their role in healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Taken together, our experiences demonstrate how infection control measures can minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the healthcare setting."
"Two weighted correlation coefficients R S , that allow to give more weight to the lower and upper ranks simultaneously, were proposed by the authors in a previous work [1] . These indexes were obtained computing the Pearson correlation coefficient with a modified Klotz and modified Mood scores. In the sequel of that work, two new generalized weighted coefficients A S , the signed Klotz A K and the signed Mood A M , to measure the concordance among several sets of ranks, putting emphasis on the extreme ranks, were deduced [2] . The van der Waerden weighted coefficient A W [5] could also be included in these generalized coefficients. In that work, a relationship between the generalized A S and the average of pairwise R S was derived. Besides that, the distribution of the generalized weighted agreement coefficients is derived, and an illustrative example is shown. The present paper aims to extend this last work carried out by the authors [2] , performing a simulation study to assess the behavior of the new coefficients. So, the goal of this paper is the comparison of the performance of four coefficients: three weighted coefficients to measure agreement among several sets of ranks emphasizing top and bottom ranks at the same time, the signed Klotz, the signed Mood and the van der Waerden coefficients, with the Kendall's coefficient that attributes equal weights to all rankings. This comparison is made through the implementation of a simulation study using the Monte Carlo method, as usual in this kind of studies [3, 7, 9] . The remainder of paper is organized in five sections. In Sect. 2, the four concordance coefficients compared in the simulation study performed in this work, the Kendall's, the van der Waerden, the Klotz and the Mood coefficient are presented, and treating these coefficients as test statistics, their asymptotic distributions, under the null hypotheses of no agreement among the rankings, are stated. The Monte Carlo simulation study design used in this paper is outlined in Sect. 3 . In Sect. 4 the results of the mentioned simulation study are shown and finally, in Sect. 5, conclusions are drawn.@story_separate@In the simulation study presented in this paper, it will be used four coefficients to measure agreement among several sets of ranks: the Kendall's coefficient that assigns equal weights to all rankings and three weighted coefficients that emphasized the top and bottom ranks at the same time, the van der Waerden weighted coefficient [5] and the two coefficients previously proposed by the authors, the signed Klotz and the signed Mood [2] . Therefore, this section will briefly present these coefficients, namely the general expression and asymptotic distributions, since they are necessary to carry out the Monte Carlo simulation study. To present the coefficients described below, it is considered that there are n subjects to be ranked by m > 2 independent observers or judges or in m moments, giving rise to m sets of ranks, and also that R ij represents the rank assigned to the jth subject by the ith observer, for i = 1, 2, . . . , m and j = 1, 2, . . . , n. The Kendall's coefficient of concordance W [6, 11] is the ratio between the variance of the sum of the ranks assigned to subjects, represented by S, and the maximum possible value reached for the variance of the sum of the ranks taking into account the values of n and m, where max(S) = m 2 n(n 2 −1)/12 is the value of S when there is a total agreement among the ranks. Representing by R j = m i=1 R ij the sum of the ranks assigned to the jth subject, for j = 1, . . . , n, the Kendall's coefficient of concordance W is given by The Kendall's coefficient can take values in the interval [0, 1] [6] . This coefficient attains: the maximum value 1 when there is perfect agreement among the m sets of ranks, only if there are no tied observations; the minimum value zero when there is no agreement, only if m(n + 1) is even. Although the coefficient W is normally used as a measure of agreement among rankings, it could also be used as a test statistic. There is a relationship between W and the Friedman χ 2 r statistic, χ 2 r = m(n − 1)W , which has an approximate chi-squared distribution with n − 1 degrees of freedom [4] . Consider a generic score S ij which is computed based on the rank R ij , for i = 1, 2, . . . , m and j = 1, 2, . . . , n. The score S ij can be: -the van der Waerden score [10] -or the signed Mood score [1] Note that, for the generic score S ij are valid the following equalities: 1. n j=1 S 2 1j = n j=1 S 2 2j = · · · = n j=1 S 2 mj = C S , where C S is a non null constant that depends on the sample size n and the scores S ij . 2. n j=1 S 1j = n j=1 S 2j = · · · = n j=1 S mj = 0, that is, S i• = 0, for i = 1, 2, . . . , m. These happens because one has: -in the case of the van der Waerden and signed Klotz scores (a) if n odd, for k = 1, 2, . . . , n 2 (where [k] represents the integer part of k), and for k = 1, 2, . . . , n 2 ; -in the case of signed Mood scores In a previous work [2] , the authors proposed two new weighted concordance coefficients, built similarly to Kendall's coefficient of concordance W defined in Sect. 2.1. These new coefficients, as well as the van der Waerden coefficient, are based on the ratio between the variance of the n sums of m scores awarded to subjects, denoted by S 2 SS , and the maximum value that this variance can attain considering the values of m and n. So, the weighted coefficients of agreement to measure the concordance among m sets of ranks, giving more weight to the extremes ones, can be defined by where S •j is the sum of the scores of m observers for the subject j and S •• is the average of all m × n scores S ij , for i = 1, 2, . . . , m and j = 1, 2, . . . , n. Attending that S •• = n j=1 S •j /n = 0 then Therefore, making some calculus (see [2] for details), the weighted coefficients to measure the concordance among m sets of ranks, putting emphasis on the extremes ones (van der Waerden, Klotz and Mood coefficients), can be given by the general expression These coefficients take values in the interval [0, 1]. Similarly to the Kendall's coefficient, these three weighted coefficients can be used as test statistics. Their asymptotic distributions were postulated in a theorem, proved in previous work by the authors [2] , which states that: under the null hypotheses of no agreement or no association among the rankings, the statistic m(n−1)A S has an asymptotic chi-square distribution with n−1 degrees of freedom. Using R software, version 3.6.2 [8] , a Monte Carlo simulation study was carried out to compare the performance of the three weighted coefficients to measure agreement among several sets of ranks emphasizing top and bottom ranks at the same time, presented in Sect. 2.2, with the Kendall's coefficient of concordance that awards equal weights to all rankings, shown in Sect. 2.1. Coefficients performance was estimated by the proportion of rejected null hypotheses, when testing whether the underlying population concordance coefficient is higher than zero. To simplify the writing, from now on, we will refer this proportion as power of coefficient. The main objective of this simulation study is to contrast the virtue of each one of the three coefficients in identifying agreement among various sets of ranks given emphasis on both lower and upper ranks simultaneously, when compared with the Kendall's coefficient of concordance. The data generation scheme adopted in this study was similar to the one followed by Legendre [7] . The first group of observations was produced through the generation of a n-dimensional vector of standard random normal deviates. To obtain each one of the others groups of n observations, for some proportion 0 < p < 0.5, and choosing an appropriate standard deviation σ, it was made the following: 1. random normal deviates with zero mean and standard deviation σ were added to the observations with the most extreme ranks in the first group of observations, that is for i = 1, . . . , [np] and i = n − [np] + 1, . . . , n; 2. random normal deviates with zero mean and standard deviation σ were generated for the observations with the intermediate ranks in the first sample, that is for The m sets of observations were converted into m sets of ranks considering an ascending order. These m sets of ranks are the related samples that were considered. Simulating the data by this way, the agreement among the groups of ranks is higher in the lower and upper ranks than in the intermediate ones. The six values considered for σ (σ = 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5) allow to evaluate the performance of coefficients for several intensities of agreement, being that the lower values of σ correspond to higher degrees of agreement. For the proportion of ranks that are in agreement, two values were taken into account (p = 0.1, 0.25), which allow to compare the performance of the coefficients in a scenario where the concordance was concentrated on a higher proportion of extreme ranks (scenario 1: p = 0.25), with a scenario in which the concordance was focused on a lower proportion of extreme ranks (scenario 2: p = 0.1). Synthesizing, in the simulation study were taken into account: -three different number of independent observers or judges, m = 3, 4, 5; -five different number of subjects, n = 20, 30, 50, 100, 200; -two values considered for the proportion of ranks that are in agreement, p = 0.1, 0.25; -and six intensities of agreement, σ = 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5. Considering all possible combinations of these values, 180 simulated conditions were evaluated. For each simulated condition, 10000 replications were run in order to: 1. calculate the means and standard deviations of Kendall's, van der Waerden, signed Klotz and signed Mood coefficients for the simulated samples; 2. estimate the power of each coefficient by the percentage of rejected null hypotheses, assessed at 5% significance level, when testing whether the underlying population concordance coefficient is higher than zero. The simulation results related to the means and standard deviations of the concordance coefficients are given in Table 1 , Table 2 and Table 3 for m = 3, 4, 5, respectively, while the corresponding powers are shown for m = 3 in Fig. 1 for scenario 1 and in Fig. 2 for scenario 2, for m = 4 in Table 4 , and for m = 5 in Table 5 . The tables are in the Appendix. The most relevant results presented in the mentioned figures and tables were analyzed and are exposed below. To achieve a better understanding of the results of the simulation study, means and standard deviations of the simulated concordance coefficients are presented in Table 1 , Table 2 and Table 3 . Analyzing these tables, in what concerns the mean estimates for the coefficients under study, we highlight the following results: -Fixing n and σ, for all values of m considered, the means for all four coefficients estimates are higher in scenario 1 (p = 0.25) than the respective values in scenario 2 (p = 0.1); this occurs, as expected, because in scenario 1 there is a higher percentage of ranks that are in agreement; -For both scenarios, for all values of m and n in study, and for all the coefficients, for higher degrees of agreement, corresponding to smaller values of σ, the means of coefficients estimates are higher than for smaller degrees of agreement; that is, as expected, the means of coefficients estimates decrease as σ increases; Concerning the empirical standard deviations, no pattern was found when comparing the four coefficients, the both scenarios and the six intensities of agreement. The standard deviations of the four coefficients decreased, as n and m increased. Regarding the powers of the four coefficients, analyzing Fig. 1 for scenario 1 and in Fig. 2 for scenario 2, for m = 3, and Table 4 and Table 5 for m = 4 and m = 5 respectively, it can be stated that: -Fixing n and σ, for all values of m considered, the powers of all indexes are higher in scenario 1 (p = 0.25) than the respective values in scenario 2 (p = 0.1); this occurs, as expected, because in scenario 1 there is a higher percentage of ranks that are in agreement; -For both scenarios and for all the number of judges considered (m = 3, 4, 5), the powers of all coefficients are higher for smaller values of σ when compared to the higher ones; -For both scenarios, the three weighed coefficients A W , A K and A M have higher powers than the Kendall's coefficient of concordance W ; nevertheless, this difference is more evident in scenario 2 in which the concordance was concentrated on a lower proportion of extreme ranks; -In scenario 1 (respectively, in scenario 2), for higher values of σ, the Klotz powers are slightly lower (respectively, higher) than the correspondent values of the other two weighted coefficients, what is more evident for lower values of n; -For all values of m and n, for both scenarios, towards smaller values of σ, the powers attained the maximum value (100%), but for higher values of σ, the powers decrease as σ increases, being this wane more pronounced for small values of n, where the achieved powers are far from been reasonable; for higher values of σ, the powers are not reasonable (because they are much below 70%), and this is worse in scenario 2; -For all values of m and n, in scenario 1, the powers of all the four coefficients have a similar behavior for each one of the six intensities of agreement in study, whereas, in scenario 2, for higher values of σ, the powers of all coefficients show a distinct behavior, being the powers of the Klotz coefficient the ones that reach always the highest values for the same n and σ, while the van der Waerden and the Mood weighted coefficients have lower and quite similar values; -For a certain value of n and a fixed σ, the powers of the four coefficients increase as m increases. @story_separate@In this paper, the performance of the three generalized weighted agreement coefficients A S to measure the concordance among several sets of ranks putting emphasis on the extreme ranks, the two new ones proposed by the authors [2] -the generalized signed Klotz and the signed Mood coefficients-and the van der Waerden coefficient, was compared with the behavior of Kendall's coefficient of concordance W that assigns equal weights to all rankings. In order to assess whether the generalized weighted agreement coefficients, especially the signed Klotz and the signed Mood coefficients, can be a benefit in assessing the concordance among several sets of ranks, when one intends to place more emphasis on the lower and upper ranks simultaneously, a Monte Carlo simulation study was carried out. The simulation study allowed to show some interesting results. It can be noticed that all coefficients in study, the three generalized weighted ones and the non-weighted, showed a better performance when the agreement is focused on a higher proportion of extreme ranks than when it is located on a smaller proportion. It can also be stated that the behavior of all coefficients is better for higher degrees of agreement when compared to the smaller ones, for both proportions of extreme ranks under study and for all the number of judges considered. It can still be seen that for a fixed number of subjects and intensity of agreement, the powers of the four coefficients increase as the number of judges increases. In situations where it is important to give relevance to the agreement on the lower and upper ranks at the same time, we realized that one of the three generalized weighted agreement coefficients should be used instead of Kendall's coefficient of concordance. Besides that, we emphasize that the choice of one of the three types of generalized weighted agreement coefficients depends on the amount of extreme ranks that are the focus of the assessment. It is very interesting to verify that, in cases where the concordance was focused on a lower proportion of extreme ranks, the Klotz coefficient show the best performance when compared with the other two generalized weighted coefficients. But on the contrary, this coefficient is the worst in occurrences where the agreement is located in a higher proportion of extreme ranks, being the Signed Mood and van der Waerden coefficients the ones that reveal the best performance in this case. In both scenarios, the Signed Mood and van der Waerden coefficients present quite similar powers to the several intensities of agreement considered in this study, for a fixed number of subjects and a fixed number of judges. We believe that this simulation study helps to understand the profits that can result from the use of the generalized weighted coefficients of agreement A S , instead of the non weighted Kendall's coefficient of concordance, in situations where it is intended to weight the extreme ranks simultaneously.

The coefficients for m judges studied in this paper generalize the coefficients previously proposed by the authors for two judges in a preliminary work [1] where a simulation study is also carried out. As the main result of the simulation study, we highlight the best performance of Klotz coefficient in detecting concordance in situations where the agreement is located in a lower proportion of extreme ranks, contrary to the case where the agreement is located in a higher proportion of extreme ranks, in which the Signed Mood and van der Waerden coefficients have the best performance."
"When can a film be considered obscene? And/or when is banning that film an infringement of people's rights? This matters in the Unites States, as the First Amendment explicitly protects the freedom of speech. But if these rights are to be upheld, a semantic boundary needs to be drawn around obscenity, determining precisely which freedoms are, and are not, protected. It was for this reason, in 1964, that the Supreme Court ruled on the Jacobellis vs. Ohio case. Nico Jacobellis, a cinema manager, had been fined for showing the Louis Malle film Les Amants; the State of Ohio had deemed the film obscene. But was it? And, if so, how was ""obscenity"" to be defined? Previously, the Supreme Court had upheld a deductive ruling (in the 1957, Roth vs. United States case), defining obscenity as material where the ""dominant theme, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest"" of the ""average person, applying contemporary community standards."" (And later, in 1973 Miller vs. California , it would overturn the Jacobellis vs. Ohio ruling with another deductive definition.) But the 1964 case was different-and intellectually of great interest-as it relied on inductive (or, arguably, abductive; Mingers, 2012) rather than deductive reasoning. In the 1964 case, Justice Potter Stewart ruled: [U] nder the First and Fourteenth Amendments, criminal laws in this area are constitutionally limited to hard-core pornography. I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description, and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture [Les Amants] involved in this case is not that. (Justia, 1964) Stewart's line, now famous, ""I know it when I see it,"" applied in this case to pornography. But might it equally apply to activism as used in both popular and academic discourses. What is activism? Can we define it? Or is it just that we ""know it when we see it""? In problematizing the definition of activism, this paper presents three linked cases in which self-professed activists each claim to be doing activism. At issue is the fact that their activisms are contradictory in both their goals and their effects. Logically, then, not all can be doing activism, if activism is definable by its aims and/or its effects. But perhaps it is not. Perhaps it is enough to have goodwill-to be ""helping""-however vaguely conceptualized. (Although, see Tilley-Lubbs [2016] ) for a critique of well-intentioned activism that had deleterious effects.) The three cases described in this article thus present a quandary. If all are examples of activism, it is necessary to trouble the notion of what activism actually is. Can it be defined by its aims? Its effects? And/or a vague sense of goodwill? Or is it necessary to rely on an inductive definition: that we know it when we see it? This is how the term seems to be used in both popular discourse and also in scholarly accounts. For example, Mendes (2015) studied feminist activism, Boykoff (2014) studied Olympics-protest activism, Kirshner (2015) studied youth activism, Carter (2018) studied environmental activism, and Reynolds and Cohen (2016) studied urban farming as activism, and yet none troubled the construct of activism itself. But if we rely on an inductive construction-the assumption that we know activism when we see it-it is also necessary to trouble the ""we"" that is doing the perceiving. Does activism necessarily invoke a progressive politics, and, if so, how is this to be defined? Or is it still ""activism"" if it is the alt-right that perceives the objective as desirable social change? Can we, for example, call it ""activism"" when Swedish farright organizations spread hate on YouTube (e.g., Farmer, 2005) ? Can we describe as ""activists"" those who participate in Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups in the United States, including an anti-Jewish movement called ""SS Warriors"" (Blee, 2016) ? And how might we describe the English Defense League, an organization mobilized ""around a core narrative of the threat posed by 'militant Islam' to the UK and more generally the west"" (Busher, 2013) ? In each of the scholarly accounts, these groups are termed ""activists."" But if any and all social-change goals are the legitimate target of ""activism,"" does the term retreat from usefulness, becoming a catch-all for any and all impassioned or vaguely ""helpful"" activities-per the paradigm of the in-group itselfthat can be wrapped up in ""activism"" to confer legitimacy? This paper teases out these theoretical issues through the following examples. First, I examine foreign volunteer workers in Central America. Second, I consider local people's resistencia [resistance] to what they perceive as foreigners ignorantly interfering in local practices. In particular, I focus on untrained ""nonmedics"" (section titled ""Nonmedics""), contested values (section titled ""Values""), and the short-handled agricultural hoe (section titled ""El Cortito""). These are contested spaces offering rich conceptual pickings. Against a potent, recent, and very bloody history of U.S. cultural imperialism in Guatemala, western sojourners and their local hosts array themselves along a continuum of positions, from wishing to invite/impose U.S. norms and practices (under rubrics of ""helping"" and ""expertise"") to subscribing to (agri)cultural relativism and not wishing to exacerbate axiological violence through the adoption/ imposition of foreign ways. Finally, I briefly consider academic activism (section titled ""Academia""), and the capacity-or otherwise-of academic work to effect change. Before this is possible though, it is necessary to examine the postcolonial historical context (in the following section) and volunteer tourism-sometimes referred to in its portmanteau form, voluntourism-both as a phenomenon and as a discourse community (section titled ""Volunteers""). It is also worth noting that this conceptual paper is not intended as an ethnography in its own right. Instead, it draws upon interpretive data already presented and analyzed in a book-length study (Stanley, 2017) for the purpose of problematizing tensions and issues within activism. For this reason, a complete methodological account is not repeated here. In brief, though, the study from which the data excerpts are drawn was based on 19 weeks of participant research over a 3-year period (2013-2015) among Western sojourners engaging in volunteer projects, learning Spanish, and/or staying in host families in Guatemala and Nicaragua. One hundred and twenty people participated directly in the study-in interviews and focus groups-including NGO directors, teachers, homestay hosts, Spanish-language students, and volunteer workers. The nationality breakdown of the interviewees was as follows: 63 U.S.-Americans, 27 Guatemalans, 14 Europeans (from the UK, Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland), eight Nicaraguans, five Canadians, and three Australians. In total, the study was based on 104 hr of interview recordings and 407 pages of field notes. Its data were coded and analyzed inductively, following the principles of constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2014) .@story_separate@Everything in Latin America starts with history and politics. And ancient and modern, these are histories covered in blood: Latin America is the region of open veins. Everything, from discovery until our times, has always been transmuted into European-or later United States-capital, and as such has accumulated in distant centers of power. Everything: the soil, its fruits and its mineralrich depths, the people and their capacity to work and to consume, natural resources and human resources. Production methods and class structure have been successively determined from outside…always for the benefit of the foreign metropolis of the moment. (Galeano, 1971, p. 2) Five hundred years after the sinking of European teeth into Indigenous throats, Latin America still lives the open veins of colonization. So much blood. So much death. First, there was the Spanish conquest, and then, for hundreds of years, there was exploitation. Independence came, but by the 1920s, all that had changed was the master (Booth et al., 2014) . By 1930, the United Fruit Company was the largest employer in Central America and the biggest landowner in Guatemala. From 1944, 10 years of ""springtime"" came under land-reforming presidents Arévalo and Árbenz. Unused United Fruit Company lands were nationalized, and workers gained a few rights. But the United Fruit Company, friends with the U.S. government, felt aggrieved. And to the United States, this looked way too much like a worker's revolution. So, the CIA overthrew Árbenz and installed a military dictator. And over the next 40 years, 200,000 people were massacred, the majority of them Indigenous, Mayan civilians killed by government paramilitaries. More blood. More death (Grandin et al., 2011) . Nicaragua's story is slightly different, but it starts the same: the conquista [conquest] and foreign exploitation. But then, in the 1930s and again in 1979, the people's protests worked, to some extent. Again, they rose up against a U.S.-funded puppet and even though the Sandinistas-the Nicaraguan revolutionaries-celebrated victory in 1979, the civil war dragged on through the 1980s, killing about 30,000 people. More blood. More death (Wade & Walker, 2011) . But even through the civil war, the Sandinista government improved literacy, health care, workers' rights, and education, and they did this, in part, thanks to the brigadas internacionalistas, the international brigades. Foreign doctors, teachers, engineers, and agriculturalists came, this time to help. They came from Europe, the United States, and elsewhere in Latin America: Che Guavara was an internacionalista, a medical doctor from Argentina who helped the revolution in Guatemala in 1954 before moving on to Cuba, the Congo, and (finally, fatally) Bolivia. So, there's a history, here, of international helpers (Wade & Walker, 2011) . Western volunteers still come. Nowadays, they talk about ""doing development"" or ""aid work"" rather than social justice or overthrowing tyrants. They don't talk about liberation theology (e.g., Gutiérrez, 1973) or structural violence (after Galtung, 1969) in the gringo bars of Central America, like they did in the 1980s (e.g., Unferth, 2011) . Now, they channel Angelina Jolie and the white-savior optics of Instagram, blaming bad luck and corrupt local politicians, blind to their own complicity in an international system of greed. The volunteers describe ""helping out,"" as if their presence-a few crumbs from their table-can change a global economic system designed and perfected in their favor. Let us not forget: [T]he poor person does not exist as an inescapable fact of destiny. His or her existence is not politically neutral and is not ethically innocent. The poor are a by-product of the system in which we live and for which we are responsible. They are marginalized by our social and cultural world. They are the oppressed, exploited proletariat, robbed of the fruit of their labor and despoiled of their humanity. Hence the poverty of the poor is not a call to generous relief action, but a demand that we go and build a different social order. (Gutiérrez, 2004, p. 44) But the Westerners don't call themselves brigadistas anymore. Now, they are voluntourists, or just tourists, often backpackers, and sometimes students of Spanish, usually staying in homestays, and sometimes learning local crafts. And just as Central America provided bananas, because that's what the international system wanted, now it provides voluntourism. In developing-world playgrounds, young Westerners play identity games, reinscribing old colonial relationships. Instead of extracting cotton, sugar, and slaves, the colonizer now extracts character-building challenges on which young people might cut their teeth. Otherwise, little has changed. Whole industries have sprung up in Central America selling formative experiences to young gringos. Goudge (2003, p.35) writes: [Volunteer work provides] a chance to improve one's career prospects by cutting one's teeth on 'unusual' challenges.…This is a continuation in a different guise of the old colonial relationship whereby colonies were regarded as essential providers of what the 'mother country' needed and desired. Only in those days it was slaves, sugar and cotton rather than character-building safari adventures. The volunteers are still changing lives, but now it's mainly their own. This is to say that a codependent relationship still exists, in which Central American tourism accommodates longer-term sojourners engaged in various activities that, arguably, serve the needs of the sojourners more than they do the local people. But the tourism industry matters enormously to local economies, too. Tourism contributes 9.1% of Nicaraguan gross national product, for example, and provides almost 200,000 people's livelihoods (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2014) . This codependency is thus still one in which power is tilted heavily in favor of those from outside, and as Galeano argues (above), Latin America is (still) a region of open veins, its resources transmuted into, determined from, and accumulated in distant centers of power for the benefit of the foreign metropolis of the moment. But this is not the discourse within which volunteer tourism is undertaken. Instead, social imaginaries of ""helping,"" ""authenticity,"" and ""fun"" permeate volunteers' own descriptions of their activities and also the advertising that allows them to find opportunities. All over the gringo press in Central America, you see ads in English for volunteer jobs. Here's one: ""Weekend staff at Black Cat Hostel. Free food, cheap drinks. 3 months minimum commitment. … Evening and weekend bar staff needed at the Old School Bar. Guaranteed fun. Give José a call"" (Xela Who Magazine, June 2015). Here is another: ""Put your education to use by teaching at the Community Center! … support education [for] over 200 kids in need in the community"" (Kamalbe poster, shown in Stanley, 2017, p. 97) . Other ads offer volunteer projects in coffee farms, kindergartens, and even a domestic violence shelter. Why, I ask the gringos working here, why do they think people hire them, the gringos rather than the locals? And one tells me: I got a job as a waitress. I joined a band. Like, either one I wasn't qualified to do in the US.… Here, I literally just walk up to people and [I'll] be like, 'Hey I think you need a waitress', 'alright', 'good, that's me'.…I'm also very go getter, yeah, and I'm very active and have a lot of ideas. So maybe that's partially just me. I think, yeah, there's just a lot of opportunities to start working on projects [here] .…I think [local people] could [do the same] if they wanted to, yeah. (A participant-pseudonym ""Amber""-cited by Stanley, 2017, p. 2) Let us be clear. This volunteer cannot do what Che Guevara did; she's not a doctor. But she is go-getting and active, and she has lots of good ideas. Local people could do this too, if they wanted to. If they wanted to. The problem is, seemingly, that they don't have good ideas and they're not go-getter enough. And also: they can't afford to work for free. And perhaps volunteer tourists' Whiteness confers on a bar or a band the cachet of gringo approval. But is this participant uniquely blind to her own positioning? Should we blame her? I don't think so. Along with so many others, this participant is part of a wider discourse in which ""helping"" irreducibly constructs the ""helped"" as rather helpless. This is well documented in critiques of ""development"" (e.g., Farmer, 2005) and is a position that permeated the narratives of almost all the volunteers interviewed for this study. Am I therefore shooting fish in a barrel by citing and then critiquing these participants, embedded as they are in a paradigm of which I am critical? Do I seduce and betray them, building trust and then breaking it down as I re-present them as nasty imperialists? I hope not. My view is that they are not to blame. Instead, they are part of a system that is to blame, and also one in which we are all complicit, particularly those of us who work in center-west education. As long as our medical schools value prequalification experience of dubious ethical standing, premed students will seek out opportunities to practice on human beings in the majority world (Stanley, 2017, pp. 114-120) . And as long as employers and colleges value (and in some cases, even promote and even give credit for) volunteer tourism, it will thrive. So, when their quotes are read from outside the volunteer-tourism discourse community (as I and presumably some readers are doing), the participants sound naïve (at best) and actively harmful and neoimperialist (at worst). But then does critiquing their discourses fall into precisely the trap of ""academic activism"" described in the ""Academia"" section? Is there a risk, here, of axiological and epistemological imperialism of our own, in which our morally superior, more ""woke"" discourses trump those of naïve volunteer tourists who are gamely trying to ""help""? Herein is part of the paradox that even this paper itself may problematically be part of academic activism. This discussion continues in the ""Academia"" section. But some voluntourism is even more harmful and here-I'm sorry-we come back to blood: I was talking to someone who was in the process of applying to medical school, and he was like, 'You're going on an international volunteer trip for medicine?' I said, 'Yeah, I'm really excited'. He was like, 'Yeah, I helped deliver a baby my first day [in Guatemala]. I literally landed and I went to the clinic and I did that. Then I performed a pap smear, too'. A man, an American male, doing that to …a Guatemalan woman. There's just so many different …lines that are crossed and a lack of understanding between those two parties. (Nadia, early twenties, USA, cited by Stanley, 2017, p. 115) The first week [in the clinic in Masaya, Nicaragua] was even more intimidating because Spanish was so difficult because they talk so fast, and it's all so chaotic.…They assumed that we were doctors. So, I guess they thought we were stupid.…To work there you had to put in a donation [of US$300/month]. So, I'm not really burdening anyone because I'm, I already helped. So, it's not a big deal if I'm an idiot.…Some of the nurses are a lot more welcoming, and they let me do some injections.…[As] a volunteer, I guess, you do whatever you can to help. And I think I've helped. (George, early twenties, USA, cited by Stanley, 2017, p. 80) All the medics around the table…describe the [Nicaraguan] clinic/hospital as shocking, insufficient,etc. Blood all over the floor, gloves/instruments reused between patients. [One of the NGO coordinators] Danny told me [earlier that day] about scissors so blunt that to cut suture thread you have to pull at the stitches a bit, and the wound sometimes then reopens. In this case, they got the scissors from the clinic [and] 'No, no way. Nica is way too sketchy', Candace says. Nicaragua as 'sketchy' is based on her experiences at the clinic.…Having come thinking she was helping a terribly poor country, so very poor that it needed her as a medic, has she now had this confirmed? Nicaragua is so very poor, so 'sketchy' that it cannot do anything 'properly', whether skydiving or suturing. (Field notes on a focus group, Stanley, 2017, pp. 115-116) This is the dark side of what Ibarra and Petriglieri (2010, p. 10) call ""identity play,"" defined as engagement in the provisional but active trial of possible future selves. While Candace, Amber, George, and others try out future identities in majority-world playgrounds, the experience is far from playful for their patients, whose lives and dignity are at stake. Instead of learning from Central Americans, the voluntourists are practicing on them. There's another problem with voluntourism, and it's one of positionality and the reinscribing of colonial-type power relations. Goudge (2003, p. 17) says: [T]he constant flow of development visitors from the materially better off countries… [may] unwittingly transmit a message that [practices] in the West are superior to those in [the South]…The message of superiority and corresponding inferiority, repeated endlessly in relation to all aspects of life, contributes to people believing the idea that everything in the West is superior [.] This is why Candace and George are able to perform as doctors, because local people expect the gringos to know better, even when-as in this case-they don't. But what happens when gringos do know better? What happens if the West is getting something right? One issue that came up often in the data is that of deeply entrenched homophobia and transphobia in Central America: There are instances [in my Spanish class, in Xela, Guatemala]…where I'm like, 'I do not believe that'. For instance, talking with a teacher who…was talking about [her] view on gay people. That's something that I found really hard to deal with.…It's just something where her core belief…was that people who are homosexual were incorrect, like there was something wrong with them, that there's a disorder, when I know that's not true. They say that…homosexuals will go to hell … She was explaining that she thinks there's a spirit, like a demon-ish spirit controlling them. That just contradicts what I know. (Amy, early twenties, USA, cited by Stanley, 2017, p. 90) I've had experiences with some of my [local, Spanish-language] teachers [in the western highlands of Guatemala]…When they've asked about my romantic life, and I am [a woman] married to a woman.…On Monday I actually had to ask to change teachers because [my teacher's] reaction was so awful.…He said, 'I'm fine with that', and then went on to equate homosexuality with prostitution, to say that transvestites were members of gangs and that people were right to be scared of them because they were like these big tattooed men in women's clothes. (Alice, mid-twenties, UK, cited by Stanley, 2017, p. 89) There is a tension here. On the one hand, there are-or should be-certain universal values, such as a respect for all human beings, and therefore an acceptance of LGBTIQA+ identities. I went to a small but vocal Pride parade in Xela, Guatemala, in 2015 and waved a rainbow flag. But I also ducked a confrontation when my homestay host in Antigua, Guatemala, was openly homophobic: I was staying with a host family and [my host mother], over a few drinks on the Friday night, was really homophobic. Like wildly homophobic, equating people who are gay with child molesting and pedophilia and stuff. I was like, 'Um, some of my best friends -' but she wouldn't hear it. So, I made an excuse and went to bed early because I thought, 'I don't want to sit and drink with this woman, but also I don't want to rock this boat, and I've got to stay here'. But I felt so guilty afterwards for not saying anything. … Should I be standing up for people [for example, my close friends who are gay] who aren't there? I was just hiding behind [seeming] straight privilege. I had talked about my ex-novio [ex-boyfriend] .…Then someone said, 'Oh no, no. Choose your battles. You're not going to change that woman's mind. You can't go in being all colonial. It's not your place'. (Stanley, 2017, p. 128) I wonder about my own activism: was I an activist (or an imperialist?) when I attended the Pride parade? And was a cop-out (or was I decolonizing tourism?) when I chose not to engage with my host's homophobia? It is easy to frame either course of action as activism, or not. I might ask: who am I to tell Guatemalans what to think? But I might equally ask: where was my calling out of social injustices? Neither question can be adequately resolved within the vague rubric of ""activism."" Some interviewees grappled with the same issue: [The Danish volunteers, in Granada, Nicaragua] did a sexual education class a couple of weeks ago.…For the [high-school] kids to be in our program, the Nica[raguan] parents have to be accepting of what we're teaching them.…When we're teaching tolerance for homosexuality…because there is a deeply, deeply embedded homophobic culture [in Nicaragua].…I think [ours] is just a very progressive approach to education. In a lot of our home universities, our schools, it wouldn't be seen that way, but compared to the culture here, it is. (Sally, mid-twenties, USA, cited by Stanley, 2017, p. 100) To Sally, the power dynamics of these competing values are simple: tolerance is the Trojan horse invited in with the free, after-school program run by Westerners. But to Sam, the issue is more nuanced, especially in light of the bloody history of imperialist meddling, not least by the United States, in Central America: I don't feel like you can go into a place [in Sam's case, Quetzaltenango, Guatemala] that's not yours, where you're a foreigner and where your passport gives you incredible privilege…and your country has a terrible legacy-I really don't feel like you can go into a place and lecture people. Even though I feel uncomfortable, after a while [of] my [host] family [saying] , 'You need a novia' [girlfriend]…at the same time, I still don't feel like I'm in a position where I can be like, 'Okay, you need to shape up'. …As much as I would love to see a flowering of LGBT acceptance in Central America…I think it's kind of the white man's burden, and is it the gay white man's burden if I come in and lecture…the people I interact with on a daily basis to say, 'Okay, this is my identity and my identity's getting accepted in my country and you need to accept it'? (Sam, early twenties, USA, cited by Stanley, 2017, p. 94)  The medical voluntourists say they are doing activism, the Danish volunteers say they are doing activism, I say I am doing activism. Are we all activists? None of us? Some of us? Defined how? I tried resolving this swirl of questions by asking local people. Chatting about my research with cab drivers and homestay hosts and other strangers-I told them about the nonmedics and the problematics of power, explaining it simply, in Spanish, as something I was curious about, and asking what they thought-most shrugged and said, ""Pues, nos ayudan"" [Well, they're helping us]. Implicitly, they mimicked the internacionalistas' [international brigades'] discourses of the 1980s, seemingly grateful for the table crumbs however inadequate. And then I asked myself: was my shiny criticality a form of imperialism, too? Then a Guatemalan teacher, critical and forthright, told me about local resistance to the voluntourist antics of the gringos, especially those instigating projects of their own devising. Framing local people as opportunistic but ultimately savvier than the gringos, who ""didn't know any better,"" Barbara inverts the trope of foreign aid workers leading hapless peasants out of ignorance. Her voice is gleeful as she recounts: Gringos came to the countryside [in the western highlands of Guatemala, near Lake Atitlán] and said, 'Oh my God, they will ruin their backs weeding with those shorthandled hoes! Don't they realize?' So, they went back to the USA and raised money for the poor, ignorant Guatemalans. And, proudly, they brought back their long-handled hoes, showed people how to use them, and handed them over. The local people were very happy. Lots of nice, smiley photos were taken. These were really good hoes with heads made from 1 single piece of reinforced steel. They were much better than the cheap, Chinese-made ones from the local ferretería [ironmonger] , which tended to break where the two pieces had been welded together. When the gringos left, the people cut the handles down to the length they were used to, because that's what they were used to and what they knew how to use. No one thought anything much of it. The gringos just didn't know any better. (Barbara, early fifties, Guatemala, [translated from Spanish], in Stanley, 2017, p. 106) In good faith, I cited her story when I wrote the book. See, I mused: not all ""activism"" is activism. But then Barbara's own implied activism began to unravel, too. Is this local agency resisting foreign meddling? Or is this a victory for the oppression and injury of workers? After reading more about the short-handled hoe, I have come to understand this story differently from how I first saw it. The short-handled hoe-el cortito (the ""shorty"")-was banned in California in 1975, after a series of Industrial Safety Board hearings. In these, evidence was sought from employers, union leaders, farm workers (most of whom were Central American migrants) and the physicians treating the back injuries caused by their bending double to use the short-handled hoe. Evidence against el cortito included medical: When I used the short-handled hoe my head would ache, and my eyes hurt because of the pressure of bending down so long. My back would hurt whenever I stood up or bent over. I moved down the row [of crops] as fast as I could so I could get to the end and rest my back for a moment. (Farm worker, cited by Murray, 1982, p. 29) I can unequivocally say that the use of this hoe will cause tissue injury and severe back pain, and late may result in degeneration of the intervertebral discs and other supporting elements of the spine, thereby causing pain, limitation of motion, increased vulnerability to severe injury, and in many cases complete physical disability. (Physician, cited by Murray, 1982, p. 34) But el cortito's effect was not just catastrophic for individuals. Its capacity to injure also caused a rapid turnover of workers, which, in turn, made it difficult to organize trade unions (Murray, 1982, p. 38) . Why, then, was el cortito ever used at all? Employers' testimonies cite a clear advantage: surveillance: ""With the long-handled hoe I can't tell whether they are working or just leaning on their hoes. With the short-handled hoe, I know when they are not working by how often they stand up"" (Agricultural supervisor, cited by Murray, 1982, p. 28) . So, were the gringos who brought the high-quality, long-handled hoes as naïve as Barbara suggests? I don't think so. I do wonder who, precisely, cut down the handles: was it the workers themselves or was it perhaps their supervisors? This detail was elided from the story, but it is important. The Central American workers themselves, in the California case, certainly did not prefer el cortito. A Central American agricultural worker from that case, is recorded as saying: The message was clear: if I didn't like working with the short-handled hoe, I could quit. There were others to do the work. The contractor didn't have to deal with what the farm workers wanted, so we continued to use el cortito. … They didn't want the farm worker to stand up. Psychologically, that gives us some dignity. …When you are bent over, it's showing humility. … It was time for us to overcome these things. (Cited by Murray, 1982, p. 31) Instead of being a local preference, is el cortito more a symbol of laborers' lowly position and a tool of surveillance by their supervisors? If so, can el cortito be located as conceptually adjacent to homophobia, as a local phenomenon for which there is no justification in a universalist model of social justice but as something that can, perhaps, be turned into a local symbol of resistance against what appears to be neocolonial gringo meddling? There is no easy answer. Pitted against one another are, on the one hand, an ethical universalism and its potential for the reinscribing of neocolonial power relations, versus, on the other hand, cultural relativism and the risk that phenomena like homophobia and el cortito will thrive thanks to a (misplaced?) postcolonial resistance. Decolonization, on the one hand, and calling out social injustice, on the other, may thus be contradictory. Either may be the purpose of activism, which is why, as a construct, activism is rather empty. Related, how are we to define activism in an academic setting? Farmer (2005) , researching structural violence and medical ethics in ""developing world"" contexts, writes: ""There have been few attempts to ground medical ethics in political economy, history, anthropology, sociology, and the other contextualizing disciplines."" (p. 204)…""The quandary ethics of the individual constitute most of the discussion of medical ethics.… might positively influence Candace or George? All believe they are ""doing activism."" Few will ever read my esoteric, academic papers. What good did I do? Here is what I cling to. After Freire (1986) , my activism is conscientização, a ""consciousness raising"" and, I hope, a seed of conscientização for others, too. I teach in higher education and it may be that some of my hard-won conscientização will leak out into my classes. Perhaps, instead of medical volunteering in Central America (practicing on local people, and implicitly holding them in low esteem), my students might choose, instead, to learn Spanish, or weaving, or art, or Mayan cosmology-anything, really-in Central America (thus learning from local people, and explicitly holding their culture in much higher esteem). This is my hope. But I do despair that comedians, such as Frankie Boyle, are the center of cultural gravity in a way that even the most successful academics are not. If my activism is not about improving Nicaraguan clinics and I must rely on those I can influence, would I not be better placed as an influencer outside of academia? I wonder.

Phiona Stanley https:// orcid. org/ 0000-0002-6491-1570@story_separate@""Activism,"" explored here, is difficult to define and thus to measure, and the actions of all the ""activists"" in this article would be easy to reframe in other ways. Putting untrained U.S.-American teenagers in positions of power, in which they pretend to be doctors for those who cannot afford proper medical care-this could equally well be called human experimentation. Similarly, is Barbara's resistance false consciousness? And is my own academic activism wishful thinking? Or even axiological violence? This paper has asked at least as many questions as it has answered. I wish it were otherwise, but as I hope to have conveyed, there is a need for complexity here, and the rush toward facile answers is part of the problem. Decolonization, on the one hand, and addressing social injustice, on the other, are sometimes contradictory, and ""activism"" needs to address this. This paper has explored some of the issues inherent in who gets to claim they are doing activism and why. It has suggested a framework of structural violence, much bigger than activism itself, that acknowledges intersectional power relations. This draws, perhaps improbably, from the idealism and liberation theology of the original internacionalistas: those who went to help the green shoots of the people's revolutions in Central America in the 1980s, before ""helping"" was subsumed, a generation later, into the neoliberal voluntourism industry.","This paper critically examines epistemological, ontological, and axiological tensions of activism in three related contexts. These are, first, (primarily medical) volunteer tourism ideologies and practices in Central America, including U.S.-American teenagers volunteering in medical centers where, entirely untrained, they do sutures and injections, deliver babies, and help with amputations. Second, the paper considers and critiques local norms (e.g., widespread homophobia) and materials (e.g., the use of short-handled agricultural hoes) that may be discursively constructed as resistance to western imperialism. Finally, the critique turns back on the researcher gaze itself, problematizing the notion of academic activism in spaces, like these, where criticality itself is an imported—arguably luxurious—folly. Local people, it is apparent, do not want convoluted theorizing or Western hand-wringing; they want proper medical care. The paper therefore considers the extent to which academic work in such spaces can call itself activism at all. Three years of ethnographic research inform the paper (2013–2015, predominantly in Guatemala and Nicaragua), including hundreds of hours of interviews and participant observational fieldwork, in Spanish and English, with local stakeholders (e.g., teachers and homestay hosts) and Western volunteer tourists. The paper is theorized with reference to postcolonial theory, critical medical ethics, and liberation theology."
"Nepal was on country-wide lockdown starting from 24 March 2020 as a measure imposed by the government to curb the novel coronavirus virus disease 2019 . The lockdown period was extended in increments and ended on 21 July 2020. 1 This measure to contain and manage the pandemic has given rise to a pattern of adverse experiences such as loss of employment, financial hardship, social isolation, grief, school closures, and property loss. 2 During stressful situations faced during the pandemic, violence of all etiologies in domestic settings are likely to rise. 2 Deviant behaviors towards children due to difficulties in managing parental stress are likely to rise as well. 3 Free Full Text Articles are Available at www.jnma.com.np Identification of people at high risk of violence, impulsive acts, homicide, and suicide is extremely important to ensure good mental health during lockdown. The present study aimed to explore the pattern of interpersonal violence experienced by people living in Nepal during the lockdown period.@story_separate@This was an open descriptive, web-based, cross-sectional study designed following the CHERRIES checklist. 4 The study was approved by the institutional review committee of Nepal Health Research Council (Ref: 332/220p). The study was conducted for a period of 4 months (April 1st to July 30th, 2020). The questionnaire included demographic variables and the World Health Organization wellbeing Index (WHO-5) 5 questions to assess subjective wellbeing. The WHO-5 is a 5-item questionnaire which segregates participants with a score below or equal to 13 as having poor mental wellbeing, requiring further evaluation for depression. Information regarding domestic violence and substance abuse were collected using questions designed by the study team consisting of medical doctors and psychiatrists. The questions were included on the basis of face validity. The questionnaire was pretested among a group of 15 participants to ensure clarity and validity. The pre-test participants were excluded from the study. Convenience sampling was used with the web-based survey link sent in various social media groups (Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter) using specifically created social media accounts. The link to the survey was shared multiple times with no benefits from participation and purpose of study clearly mentioned. Informed consent from participants was obtained in the same google form used for the study. The form only contained the initials and credentials of the investigators and no identifiers. Storage of data was done using password-protected google drive with investigator limited access. To ensure that participants were still living inside the country, they were asked to provide the name of the city they resided during the lockdown. Participants living outside Nepal were excluded. Incomplete questionnaires were not used in the analysis. The completion rate was 0.986, 556/564. Participants were only allowed to change their answers before clicking submit. The participants were requested to only fill the form once and close the link if they have filled it previously, to prevent repetition of study samples. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 23.0 (Armonk, NY, IBM Corp). Descriptive statistics using mean, standard deviation, frequency and percentage were used to describe the socio-demographic profile, substance use pattern, pattern of interpersonal violence, and the WHO wellbeing index scores of the study participants. A total of 556 participants were included in the final analysis. There were 283 (50.9%) male and 271 (48.7%) female participants. Two participants chose not to disclose their gender. The mean age of the study participants was 25.93 ± 6.88 years. There were 110 (19.8%) married, 2 legally separated, 1 divorced and 1 widowed participants. All the study participants had received some form of formal education. The current living arrangement reported by study participants during the lockdown period varied from being alone 57 (10.3%), with spouse only 16 (2.9%), with family 422 (75.9%), with friends 44 (7.9%), with other relatives 12 (2.2%) and with others 5 (0.9%). When asked if violence has occurred to them during the lockdown, 11 participants chose the ""prefer not to say"" option. Also, 10 participants chose the ""prefer not to say option"" when asked if they had committed violence during the lockdown. The participants who chose the ""prefer not to say"" option were counted as having experienced or as having committed violence during lockdown accordingly. A total of 100 (18.0%) participants reported being a victim of Interpersonal Violence (IPV) during the lockdown. Among them, 49 (49%) experienced verbal violence only, 4 (4%) experienced physical violence only while 47 (47%) experienced both. Participants of lower age-groups were more likely to face violence. A slightly higher number of males (51, 18%) reported being a victim of IPV compared to females (47, 17.3%). Higher number of participants who had never married (85, 19.2%) experienced IPV versus those who were married (15, 13.6%). Participants with lower education level were more likely to be a victim of IPV (Table 1) . Participants living with a spouse alone (6, 37.5%) were most likely to experience violence followed by those living with friends (13, 29.5%). Total Participants Participants with a previously diagnosed mental disorder were more likely to report being a victim (12, 27 .3%) as well as a perpetrator (11, 25%) of IPV. Poor mental wellbeing as indicated by WHO-5 score less than equal to 13 was more prevalent among both victim (63, 28.3%) and perpetrator (54, 24.2%) of IPV. During the lockdown, 13 (2.3%) participants reported an increase in their tobacco smoking and 17 (3.1%) of the participants reported an increase in their alcohol consumption. More participants who had experienced IPV (6, 46.2%) and those who had committed IPV (5, 38.5%) reported an increase in their tobacco consumption during lockdown than those who had decreased or no change in tobacco use pattern. Similarly, those who had experienced IPV (4, 23.5%) and those who had committed IPV (5, 29.4%) reported an increased alcohol intake during lockdown compared to those who had decreased or no change in alcohol use (Table 2) . According to victims, siblings (18, 18%) were the most likely perpetrators of interpersonal violence followed by parents (17, 17%). Sixteen (16%) participants reported being victimized by multiple perpetrators. According to the type of violence, siblings (10, 10%) were most likely to commit both physical and verbal violence followed by friends (9, 9%). The detailed description of different types of interpersonal violence and perpetrators reported by the study participants has been provided ( Table 3) . Table 3 .

Interpersonal violence refers to violence between individuals and is subdivided into family and intimate partner violence and community violence. Interpersonal violence can take the form of physical, sexual, psychological and can involve deprivation and neglect. 6 There is a tendency for cases of domestic violence to increase following catastrophic events and rise in unemployment rates. 7 Following the Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar, an increase by 30% in domestic violence was observed. 8 Similar findings were reported post hurricane Katrina with a 35% surge of partner violence. 9 In Uganda, the cases of domestic violence regularly spike following periods of drought. 10 An alarming rise in cases regarding domestic violence have been reported worldwide since the initiation of isolation measures to curb COVID-19. Surges in calls in helpline numbers have been observed. The National Women Commision (NWC), Nepal which operates a 24hour helpline for domestic violence survivors reported 1267 calls of domestic violence and 306 calls of violence against women during the 4 months lockdown period -a sharp rise from the period before lockdown. Out of these, 232 as cases were referred to appropriate partner organizations for immediate help. 11 Countries in Europe also reported up to 60% rise in emergency calls compared to last year from women subjected to intimate partner violence. 12 In Wuhan China, the domestic violence complaints received by a police station tripled compared with the same period last year. 13 Many countries like France, Brazil, United States have reported a rise in number of cases of domestic violence during this pandemic, indicating a surge of cases worldwide. 14 In our study, the frequency of verbal violence reported by the victim as well as perpetrator was higher compared to reported physical violence. Similar finding was found from data collected through helpline calls placed to NWC, where psychological torture was the most common violence followed by physical assault, economic and sexual violence. The same study also reported 71% of the perpetrators to be intimate partners or spouses. 11 This finding also resonates with our study which demonstrated that victims of physical violence were more likely to be living with a spouse only. Participants living alone or with family revealed to be least likely to face violence. Participants of younger age were found to be more likely to face violence in our study. However, our study was limited to participants above 18 years of age and the mean age of participants was 25.93 ± 6.88 years. More study including a wider age-range of participants is necessary to come to conclusions regarding the re- With restrictions on mobility and stay at home orders, victims of domestic violence are forced to remain with their perpetrators and also face difficulty reaching out for help. Increasing duration of COVID-19 lockdown and periodic extensions have added to the stress of coping with uncertainty, fear of disease, reduced income, confinement and lack of social support. The cases of violence at home, workplace and community are also likely to follow the compound. 12 In our study more numbers of both the victim and the perpetrator of physical and verbal violence were found to have low WHO-5 wellbeing scores compared to those who did not face or commit violence. This indicates that the WHO-5 tool can potentially be used to help identify vulnerable populations likely to face violence. However, more studies on a larger scale is necessary to determine this relationship. A surge in alcohol sale has been observed during this lockdown period in different countries. 15 Experts have also warned against the harms of drinking at home. 16 However, a survey done in the UK showed that while 21% participants had been drinking more frequently, 35% participants had reduced their alcohol intake. 17 This finding is consistent with our study which revealed that a greater proportion of participants had decreased frequency of both alcohol consumption and smoking compared to those who had increased frequency. A study by Klemperar et al. attributed the increased use of tobacco and electronic cigarettes among previous users to be due to newly developed stressors during COVID-19. 18 Spike in frequency of home drinking and cigarette smoking is likely to have a direct adverse impact on family members. 16, 19 Our study revealed an increased prevalence of drinking and smoking among the victims of physical violence as well as perpetrators of physical and verbal violence -demonstrating both cause and effect relationship. Undergoing intimate partner violence increases the risk of multiple mental health conditions (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance or alcohol abuse) and physical health conditions (cardiovascular disease, chronic pain, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal problems, sexually transmitted infections, traumatic brain injury). 20 Children and adolescents exposed to violence (witnessing or victimization) by adults within the family, can develop anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance use, self-harm or suicidal ideation, and poorer general health. 21 This study has its own set of limitations. The study sample was small. More studies with large sample size would truly visualize the impact of COVID-19 on interpersonal violence, especially the magnitude of increment. The research was limited to internet users only. The study was time-bound and cross-sectional. A more in-depth study is required to form a clearer picture of the situation in the rural and remote areas with longitudinal follow up. There is also a need for further research targeting more vulnerable groups like children, adolescents and women.@story_separate@There was prevalence of interpersonal violence during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nepal. This is a double injustice in that victims not only have to face fear regarding the pandemic but also domestic violence. The stay at home orders and lack of mobility options traps victims in their own home with limited options to seek help. Identification of vulnerable groups and proper management of interpersonal violence has to be among the priority given its high prevalence, pervasive nature and almost unanimous expert consensus on its increase during periods of heightened stress. A solution to the problem of underreporting might be longitudinal studies, which have a higher yield of findings. Identifying the gender, age bracket, living arrangement and educational qualifications of the victims of interpersonal violence may be the first step in dealing with this problem.","INTRODUCTION: The government issued a country-wide lockdown in Nepal as a measure to curb the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in various difficult experiences which includes financial loss, separation from loved ones, grief, uncertainty over disease status and loss of freedom. During these stressful situations, interpersonal violence is likely to be aggravated. To avoid the occurrence of adverse events such as impulsive acts, homicide, or suicide, it is important to identify high-risk individuals. METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional, questionnaire-based, online survey by convenience sampling. The prevalence of different types of interpersonal violence with socio-demographic factors, substance use, and overall mental wellbeing was assessed by using descriptive statistical tests. RESULTS: Out of total 556 participants included in the analysis, 50.9% (283) were male and 48.7% (271) were female. There were 100 (18.0%) participants who reported being a victim of interpersonal violence and 101 (18.2%) participants who reported being a perpetrator during the lockdown. The victims of violence were more likely to be living with their spouse alone. The victims and perpetrators were also more likely to have increased alcohol and tobacco use. More number of victims and perpetrators had lower mental wellbeing scores on the WHO wellbeing index. CONCLUSIONS: There was prevalence of interpersonal violence during the COVID-19 lockdown. In addition to the fear regarding pandemic, victims have to face domestic violence placing them at a double injustice. Identification of vulnerable groups and proper management of survivors must be prioritized given the unanimous consensus on the rise of interpersonal violence during periods of heightened stress."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the extraordinary shifting prioritizations of healthcare resources. Global shortages of medical equipment, personal protective equipment and staff (due to self-isolation and personal illness) have shifted resource allocation to the most critical and urgent cases. While traditionally considered top priority, cancer screening and management have been pushed to the periphery of healthcare to allow increased time and space to be distributed to COVID-19 patients. Breast cancers comprise a significant portion of all human cancers, necessitating an investigation into the management of this heterogeneous group of diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, a survey conducted by a group in the US reported that 44% of the 609 breast cancer patients included in the study experienced delays in their cancer treatments during the pandemic [1] . Additionally, the outbreak has resulted in significant reduction of clinical prevention for breast cancer patients, such as genetics counselling and breast screening [2] , which will inevitably lead to an increased number of undiagnosed breast cancers. The COVID-19 pandemic has thus resulted in a bi-directional challenge to cancer treatment and management, exacerbated by limited clinical resources and caution in preventing COVID-19 transmission between patients and healthcare professionals. The neglect of breast cancer patients during the outbreak could negatively impact their overall survival, as delays in surgery and patient-physician consultations provide vital time for tumor progression and metastasis. This is particularly true for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive breast cancer subtype, with heightened risks of relapse and metastasis [3, 4] . Some TNBC patients have experienced delays exceeding four months for their imaging tests during the COVID-19 pandemic [5] . Treatment postponement greater than six months is associated with up to a 20% decrease in breast cancer patient overall survival and even worse outcomes for TNBC patients [6] . Delays in treatment would certainly impose a greater risk of adverse clinical outcomes for patients with metastatic TNBC. Thus, our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in this unique group of patients is imperative. Taken together, these findings support the urgent need to devise treatment strategies for TNBC patients during the COVID-19 outbreak that minimize delays while ensuring the safety of patients and healthcare professionals. Herein, we review the shifting clinical management of TNBCs during the COVID-19 outbreak. The suggested treatment recommendations can hopefully minimize SARS-CoV-2 exposure without sacrificing patient care during times when healthcare systems are overburdened. Further, we review published RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets to assess the theoretical infectability of metastatic TNBCs to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on critical host proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). These analyses highlight the potential of the virus to infect metastatic TNBC cells. Given the known increased susceptibility of cancer cells to viral infection in general [7] , this may make patients with metastatic disease particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 morbidities.@story_separate@A member of Coronaviridae, SARS-CoV-2 originated in China, in 2019, giving rise to a global pandemic and unprecedented health and economic crisis. SARS-CoV-2 infections range clinically from asymptomatic infection or mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe viral pneumonia accompanied by respiratory failure and potential death [8, 9] . The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is a critical process facilitating its widespread infection. Importantly, there are key cell entry mechanisms unique to SARS-CoV-2. The virus spike protein trimer binds the human ACE2 receptor with high binding affinity and is proteolytically activated by protease TMPRSS2 and lysosomal proteases (cathepsins), facilitating host cell entry [10] . The prevention of COVID-19 via vaccination and/or treatment of COVID-19 patients with anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents will be critical in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as those receiving treatment for cancer, a group with elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and worse COVID-19 disease outcomes. Recently, multiple vaccines have been approved globally for use against SARS-CoV-2 including BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and AZD1222 (Oxford-AstraZeneca). Immunization against COVID-19 is currently underway, where people of advanced age and/or those with a high risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 have been identified as key populations for early immunization. Despite the initiation of COVID-19 immunization, the treatment guidelines for cancer patients described herein remain relevant and should be considered until the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is controlled and hospital resources are no longer at risk. In addition to vaccines, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent, Remdesivir (GS-5734), has been FDA approved for the treatment of adults and children over the age of 12 requiring hospitalization due to COVID-19. Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue that inhibits viral replication. Remdesivir was shown to reduce recovery time in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who presented with lower respiratory tract infections (NCT04280705). Further research is required to assess the safety of Remdesivir for patients with cancer. Until anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments and COVID-19 vaccines become widespread, the careful management of cancer remains a priority. The treatment of patients with various cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique set of challenges. Cancer patients or those with a history of cancer face a disproportionately higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a poor prognosis relative to COVID-19 patients without cancer [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, many of these studies have been limited by low numbers of patients and a lack of diversity in geography, age, sex, race/ethnicity and cancer treatment information. The disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infections among cancer patients relative to non-cancer patients may be explained by evidence that cancer patients are immunocompromised while receiving anti-cancer treatments (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapies) or supporting medications (i.e., steroids) and experience the inherently immunosuppressive nature of their cancer [11, 12, 15] . Furthermore, cancer patients are often older than 60 years of age with one or more co-morbidities and are in frequent contact with healthcare services and facilities during and after cancer treatment, increasing their risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality [15] . Clinicians are now presented with the difficult task of healthcare restructuring that concurrently favors the reduction of COVID-19 transmission and the delivery of high-quality care for cancer patients. The high degree of heterogeneity among cancers and the broad spectrum of cancer progression profiles and variation in subtype-specific clinical implications mean that prioritizations for treatment must be made. These studies have highlighted cancer patients as an important at-risk group for adverse clinical prognosis following SARS-CoV-2 infection. While more data on cancer patients with COVID-19 are required, a retooling of patient cancer treatment that reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection without sacrificing potentially life-saving cancer treatments is favorable. An abundance of literature has been published focusing on the clinical outlook of cancer patients with COVID-19. However, less information exists on specific cancers and clinically relevant cancer subtypes. Thus, more research will be necessary to fully understand the effects of COVID-19 on these patients and to inform cancer type-specific treatment guidelines, as is the case for TNBC. For the effective prioritization of treatment for breast cancer patients not suspected to have COVID-19 during the pandemic, Dietz and colleagues have suggested the categorization of breast cancer patients into three priority levels (A, B & C) [16] . They also provide treatment considerations and recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic for each level. Priority A patients are considered to have an immediately life-threatening or symptomatic condition requiring urgent clinical intervention, while priority B patients have conditions that require treatment prior to the conclusion of the pandemic. The treatment of priority C patients can be postponed pending the end of the pandemic. Most breast cancer patients will fit into the priority B category, which is further subdivided into Cancers 2021, 13, 296 4 of 13 groups according to priority (B1-B3, where B1 patients are the highest priority). Given the aggressiveness of their disease, patients with TNBC are often among the highest priority for treatment. In accordance, TNBC patients are category B1 along with patients with HER2+ breast cancers. To explore changes in TNBC clinical strategies induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a literature search to provide a detailed summary of suggested TNBC treatment strategies in response to COVID-19. We queried NCBI PubMed with the keywords ""breast cancer"" and ""COVID-19"" which returned 118 articles. From these, we eliminated articles with titles lacking our search terms. For these papers, we were solely focused on retrieving information pertaining to TNBC. We summarize our findings in the ""Traditional TNBC therapies"" section and emphasize chemotherapy-related recommendations in Table 1 . Table 1 . Chemotherapy and targeted therapy recommendations for TNBC patients during COVID-19. Chemotherapy is a high priority for TNBC patients, even in the event of an overrun healthcare system [4, [17] [18] [19] . Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy are recommended for early stage TNBC patients [5, 17, 20, 21] . Chemotherapy should be administered within eight weeks of initial diagnosis [22] . Oral chemotherapeutic agents and those with lower risk of immunosuppression, such as capecitabine or vinorelbine, are preferred to other methods requiring hospital visits [18] . A cost-benefit analysis should be performed when deciding on the composition of chemotherapy regimens considering the risk of haematological toxicity and immunosuppression and patient age and comorbidities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [18, 23] . To reduce patient contact with the healthcare system, chemotherapy should be administered 3-or 4-weekly as opposed to weekly [19, 24] . Is it not recommended that older patients with early stage TNBC receive chemotherapy due to the heightened risk of complications if SARS-CoV-2 infection ensues and the limited therapeutic benefits. A modified treatment strategy minimizing immunosuppression should instead be considered for these patients (i.e., ≥70 years old) [19, 25] . Neoadjuvant therapy is recommended for TNBC due to its high rate of clinical success in moderating tumor growth prior to surgery [18] . Post-neoadjuvant therapy is recommended for patients not achieving a pathological complete response following neoadjuvant treatment, enhancing disease management and survival [17] . Neoadjuvant therapy can be used to delay surgery during the pandemic given the availability of hospital resources [26] . Adjuvant therapy should start no later than two months following surgery due to the increased risk of recurrence and death associated with delays [19] . Adjuvant capecitabine can be used to treat TNBC patients with residual disease who have undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy [19, 24, 27, 28] . Adjuvant therapy can be combined with targeted therapies for locally advanced TNBC patients [29] . Chemotherapy regimens should minimize immunosuppression. For example, monotherapy should be favored over combination treatments to reduce myelosuppression; prophylactic CSF may reduce neutropenia; and the use of corticosteroids should be limited considering chemotherapy regimen [19] . Oral treatment should be prioritized. Patients treated with anthracyclines and taxanes prior to the pandemic may benefit from transition to oral capecitabine or metronomic cyclophosphamide [19, 24, 30, 31] . For inoperable or metastatic TNBCs, consider Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (i.e., olaparib or talazoparib) if patients have a BRCA mutation [19, 24] . Despite the low frequency of olaparib-associated pneumonitis, it, along with the potential for myelosuppression should be considered [19] . A combination of chemotherapy and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab should be considered for advanced or metastatic TNBC [4, 17] , especially given the comparatively lower risk of hematological complications relative to standard chemotherapy [32] . TNBC is traditionally treated with a combination of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. The pandemic has resulted in numerous challenges to chemotherapy administration, most notably, the high frequency of hospital visits required and its immunosuppressive nature. To minimize possible exposure to the virus, it has been suggested that patients receive chemotherapy in wide intervals. For example, weekly paclitaxel administration is preferred over thrice-weekly docetaxel [33] . Outpatient administration of chemotherapy has also been raised as a potential solution to reduce hospital visits. For example, there are chemotherapy options that do not require patients to receive treatments in healthcare centers. For example, oral chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, may be taken for TNBC patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapies if residual disease persists. Further, low-dose capecitabine taken after surgery and post-surgery chemotherapy for one year among early-stage TNBC patients has been shown to diminish the risk of disease recurrence (NCT01112826) [34] . Another clinical trial showed that the addition of capecitabine to standard chemotherapy after surgery improved disease-free survival among early-stage TNBC patients with an absence of adverse side effects [35] . Thus, oral capecitabine may be taken by early-stage TNBC patients following either neoadjuvant chemotherapy or surgery and post-surgery chemotherapy to reduce patient contact with the healthcare system. The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy may serve as an alternative treatment route in the case of delayed or cancelled surgeries to limit the use of operating room resources [36] . Upon collaborative assessment of patient comorbidities and risk factors, neoadjuvant chemotherapies may be administered in place of surgery for TNBC patients as beginning with surgery is not required in the presence of systemic therapy. The standard of care for TNBCs already includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy to which patients respond well, potentially facilitating effective disease management during surgery deferral [37] . In addition, a study reported that surgery deferral for up to 6-8 weeks following chemotherapy did not impact survival outcomes of breast cancer patients [33, 38] , supporting the initial use of neoadjuvant chemotherapies among TNBC patients. Depending on patient and institutional factors, however, neoadjuvant therapy may not need to precede surgery. Spring et al. suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a viable option for tumors greater than 0.5 cm 3 [39] . For small tumors, Spring et al. recommend surgery as the favored treatment strategy as the risk of TNBC tumor progression outweighs the need for surgical resources and risk of COVID-19 contraction [39] . Patients who have completed neoadjuvant treatment should undergo surgery within 4-8 weeks, allowing for recovery from toxicity and myelosuppression [27, 28] . TNBC patients unresponsive to primary systemic therapies should receive surgery in less than four weeks, depending on tumor burden [20] . Breast conserving surgery is favored over a full mastectomy where possible if radiation oncology services are available and deferrable and frequent hospital visits are acceptable [16] . Studies assessing the risk of COVID-19 transmission following cancer surgery in the UK determined that the risk of COVID-19 exposure following surgery is minimal when staff and patients follow proper precautions [40, 41] . No patient who underwent surgery in the study period tested positive for COVID-19, and there were no critical care admissions or mortality events [40, 41] . These reports suggest that with proper precautions, essential breast surgeries can occur safely, and non-critical surgeries can be resumed during the pandemic for high-risk patients, such as TNBC patients. Many patients opt to undergo breast reconstruction following resection, which has shown to improve how patients cope with their diagnosis and cancer journey, solidifying breast reconstruction as a fundamental facet of breast cancer treatment. A group in Italy devised a protocol for breast reconstruction surgery that minimized the risk COVID-19 exposure to both physicians and the patient as well as accelerating the post-operative recovery and hospital discharge [42] . At the date of publication, 51 patients had undergone breast reconstruction following this new protocol with no additional postoperative complications and no increased risk of COVID-19 infection to the patients or staff, supporting the notion that patients can undergo reconstructive surgery in the COVID-19 era. Radiotherapy, as an alternative or in addition to chemotherapy and surgery, is used extensively in the treatment of breast cancer. Radiotherapy offers several advantages over other cancer treatment options during the COVID-19 outbreak. First, it does not require use of in-demand resources such as respirators or intensive-care unit beds (unlike surgery) [43] . Second, the radiotherapy administration schedule can be tailored to reduce the number of hospital visits [43] . Third, radiation does not subject the patient to the same extent of immunosuppressive effects as chemotherapy [43] . Taken together, these points suggest that radiotherapy may be an ideal choice when appropriate for TNBC treatment during the pandemic if proper PPE is donned and care is taken to limit the spread of disease between healthcare professionals and patients. If the need to limit radiotherapy arises due to resource constraints, Braunstein and colleagues suggest a prioritization scheme for breast cancer patients where TNBC patients are deemed high or mid-priority for radiation access based on the node status of the patient [44] . Following neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery, stage I to III TNBC patients should be referred for radiation oncology according to standard treatment guidelines [10, 45] . Patients who have completed neoadjuvant therapy who lack therapeutic targets (i.e., TNBC) are high priority for preoperative radiation therapy [33] . Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, delays in radiation are not advised due to the risk of recurrence [10, 46] . It is recommended that radiation therapy be administered within 16 weeks following the conclusion of chemotherapy or surgery [27] . TNBC patients are also at a high priority for adjuvant radiation therapy, which should be administered 2-4 months post-surgery [4, 17, 21] . The effectiveness of radiation therapy as a primary TNBC treatment, rather than in an adjuvant setting, is still debated. Evidence suggests that TNBC is resistant to radiation when used alone; however, radiotherapy with poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors may be effective due to their synergistic DNA damage-enhancing effects [47] . A recent report by the national health service (NHS) classified cancer patients receiving treatments including targeted anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and PARP inhibitors are at an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [48] . Hence, the administration of such targeted therapies, which occurs in combination with traditional therapies in TNBC patients, presents a unique set of COVID-19-related challenges that pertains to this subtype. Anti-PD-L1 therapy atezolizumab (ATZ) plus paclitaxel is an approved therapy for patients with PD-L1 positive metastatic TNBC [32] . Fortunately, immune checkpoint inhibitors such as ATZ do not exert immunosuppressive effects and thus should not augment the risk of TNBC of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to greater immunosuppression [49, 50] . Strikingly, immune checkpoint inhibitors may even boost pathogen-specific immune responses, and cases of viral or bacterial infections following treatment with ICIs are limited [51, 52] . However, there are other side effects of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition which may exacerbate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and adverse outcomes [53] . For example, cytokine release syndrome is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by the release of circulating inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon gamma [54] . Conversely, it has been suggested that this cytokine storm may be beneficial for patients with TNBC who are receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and chemotherapy [55] . While the cytokine storm is associated with acute respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients, it is suggested that TNBC patients with isolated lung metastases receiving combination immunotherapy may benefit from the COVID-19-associated cytokine storm in the lungs which may also act on metastatic lung nodules [55, 56] . Many TNBCs exhibit a deficiency in homologous recombination and the associated repair of double strand DNA breaks, which makes them sensitive to PARP inhibitors. Intriguingly, there is evidence to support the use of PARP inhibitors to hamper SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated severe COVID-19 disease [57] . Specifically, PARP inhibition may function against COVID-19 by limiting macrophage overactivation and associated cytokine storm along with protection against cell death. PARP inhibition reduces the levels of inflammatory cytokines associated with SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine storms. Thus, TNBC patients with concomitant COVID-19 receiving PARP inhibitors may experience better outcomes. Within five years of their diagnosis, women with TNBC are more likely to experience metastasis relative to women with other breast cancer subtypes [58] . Patients with TNBCs experience metastasis the bone, lungs, liver and brain. Therefore, in the context of management of TNBC during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are likely different factors to be considered if the TNBC is local and surgically removed versus a patient with metastatic disease. To our knowledge, the mortality risk of lung metastasis in TNBC patients has not yet been assessed in the context of COVID-19. However, a recent study found that both lung cancer patients or patients with lung metastasis and COVID-19 were at a heightened risk of death compared to non-metastatic cancer patients with COVID-19 [13] . Based on this finding, TNBC patients with lung metastasis likely have elevated mortality risk, although the specific implications have yet to be determined. Additionally, the elevated risk of lung metastasis in TNBC complicates the diagnosis from respiratory-related symptoms in this patient cohort. In a case study reported by Chen and Li, the presence of a cough in an advanced gynecological cancer patient was initially perceived as a sign of lung spread [59] . Follow-up analyses determined that the patient was positive for COVID-19, attributing the source of the respiratory-associated symptoms to the virus rather than lung metastasis [59] . Other reports state that pleural metastasis can mimic COVID-19 symptoms, further complicating the source of suspicious symptoms [60] . COVID-19 testing in cancer patients at multiple points in their care is thus critical for accurate disease tracking and management. The implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection for patients with metastatic TNBCs are multifaceted and complex. SARS-CoV-2 infection in an environment where lung function is already reduced may significantly worsen the risk of COVID-19 mortality. COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization often require ventilation and experience adverse outcomes, which is associated with viral load. Importantly, elevated viral load has been associated with advanced age, comorbidities and recent chemotherapy, all of which are associated with cancer. Further, intubation and mortality following hospitalization were highest in patients with the greatest viral loads [61] . The SARS-CoV-2 viral load is also associated with substantially increased IL-6 levels, indicative of cytokine storm and poor outcomes [62] . Metastasized TNBC cells may represent a cell population with enhanced susceptibility to viral infection and replication. In line with this, during the multi-step process whereby normal cells become cancerous, among other ""hallmark"" acquisitions contributing to their oncogenic phenotype, cells become capable of evasion of host immune-mediated recognition and destruction [63] . Specifically, cancer cells acquire defective anti-viral defenses, including pathways mediated by interferons, increasing their susceptibility to viral infection [7] . Thus, assuming adequate cellular expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, patients with metastatic TNBC represent a patient population with potential enhanced vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection and poor outcomes due to widespread viral infection facilitated by cancer metastasis. To determine whether TNBCs are possibly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we interrogated published RNA-seq datasets to analyze the expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in TNBC patient tumors (primary tumors and metastatic) in comparison to cell lines known to be highly infectable by SARS-CoV-2 relative to a panel of known housekeeping/reference genes (Figure 1 ) [64] . These analyses showed that TNBC patient tumors and metastasized breast cancers exhibited expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at least within the range of the infectable cell lines, suggesting that TNBC cells that come in contact with SARS-CoV-2 may be susceptible to infection. Consistent with these findings, analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression across a panel of metastatic tumors also showed that both genes are expressed in metastatic breast tumors (Figure 2 ). This further illustrates the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of metastatic breast cancer cells which may lead to heightened viral load and associated morbidities (Figure 3 ) [61, 62] . Alternatively, it is also important to mention possible effects that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have on cancer cells present in the lung, due to the enhanced susceptibility of cancer cells to viral infection ( Figure 3 ). Future case reports and studies may reveal that metastatic cancer patients that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience discernable improvements in the tumor burden. Cancers 2021, 13, x 9 of 16 may lead to heightened viral load and associated morbidities (Figure 3 ) [61, 62] . Alternatively, it is also important to mention possible effects that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have on cancer cells present in the lung, due to the enhanced susceptibility of cancer cells to viral infection (Figure 3 ). Future case reports and studies may reveal that metastatic cancer patients that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience discernable improvements in the tumor burden. Only the control/non-treated samples from each dataset were included in the above analysis. RNA Seq V2 RSEM normalized gene expression for TNBC and non-TNBC tumours was obtained through the Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, Cell 2015) dataset accessed through cBioPortal [65, 66] .

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these obstacles by restricting and delaying treatment options for patients. While therapeutic strategies for breast cancer management have been altered during the pandemic, the goal remains to maintain the standard of breast cancer care. Here, we have provided a summary of shifting clinical management of TNBC during the pandemic. This review suggests possible treatment avenues for TNBC patients to better prepare clinicians to make informed treatment strategies for TNBC management. However, caution should be taken when implementing these recommendations as more research is needed to understand the impacts of these shifts in TNBC patient outcomes. Given the global and unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have never faced such an urgent need to prioritize healthcare resources and the treatment of patients with COVID-19 while maintaining a high standard of care for patients with other pathologies. This has resulted in limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in healthy individuals and those with pre-existing medical conditions, such as cancer. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on patients with aggressive cancers (i.e., TNBC) is especially enigmatic and requires urgent research. Our analyses of published datasets (Figures 1 and 2) suggest that metastatic TNBC could be infected by SARS-CoV-2 based on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression ( Figure 3 ). This needs to be validated in laboratory models and the consequence of such infection determined. The need for a better understanding of COVID-19 has highlighted the need for openaccess publication of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 patient data to facilitate novel research and global collaboration pertaining to the impacts of COVID-19 on other diseases, such as cancer. For example, access to lung tissue gene expression data from TNBC patients would allow the investigation of possible TNBC-specific host protein and SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions and their significance in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and potential treatment avenues among TNBC patients [68] . While COVID-19 has posed enormous pressure on our healthcare systems, this global event has forced a shift in management protocols for breast cancer. Following the peak of the pandemic, these solutions may result in more efficient treatment of breast cancer without compromising the quality of patient care. This review provides a starting point for further research investigating TNBC and COVID-19. Such research is paramount during the COVID-19 crisis to ensure a high standard of care, preventing adverse TNBC patient outcomes induced by COVID-19 disease and/or obstacles to effective cancer treatment. Finally, we call for the timely development of guidelines for the management of patients with metastatic TNBC during the COVID-19 pandemic to efficaciously reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and select the most advantageous clinical treatment avenues.","SIMPLE SUMMARY: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in challenges to cancer management, exacerbated by limited clinical resources and caution in preventing COVID-19 transmission between patients and healthcare professionals. The neglect of breast cancer (in particular, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)) patients during the outbreak could negatively impact their overall survival, as delays in treatment and consultations provide vital time for tumor progression and metastasis. Herein, we review the shifting clinical management of TNBCs during the COVID-19 outbreak. The suggested treatment recommendations can hopefully minimize virus exposure without sacrificing patient care during times when healthcare systems are overburdened. Further, we review published RNA-seq data to assess the theoretical infectability of metastatic TNBCs to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. These analyses highlight the potential of the virus to infect TNBC cells. Given the known increased susceptibility of cancer cells to viral infection, this additional host cell reservoir may make patients with metastatic disease particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 morbidities. ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the need for prioritization strategies for breast cancer treatment, where patients with aggressive disease, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are a high priority for clinical intervention. In this review, we summarize how COVID-19 has thus far impacted the management of TNBC and highlighted where more information is needed to hone shifting guidelines. Due to the immunocompromised state of most TNBC patients receiving treatment, TNBC management during the pandemic presents challenges beyond the constraints of overburdened healthcare systems. We conducted a literature search of treatment recommendations for both primary and targeted TNBC therapeutic strategies during the COVID-19 outbreak and noted changes to treatment timing and drugs of choice. Further, given that SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, which has systemic consequences, management of TNBC patients with metastatic versus localized disease has additional considerations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Published dataset gene expression analysis of critical SARS-CoV-2 cell entry proteins in TNBCs suggests that the virus could in theory infect metastasized TNBC cells it contacts. This may have unforeseen consequences in terms of both the dynamics of the resulting acute viral infection and the progression of the chronic metastatic disease. Undoubtedly, the results thus far suggest that more research is required to attain a full understanding of the direct and indirect clinical impacts of COVID-19 on TNBC patients."
"Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract disorders are global and common diseases [1] . Since 1990, the age-standardised rates of stomach cancer have declined worldwide; however, stomach cancer holds onto a poor prognosis when compared to many other malignancies and ranks fifth and third in incidence and mortality among cancers, worldwide [2, 3] . Furthermore, oesophageal cancer not only has an unfavourable prognosis but also remains the sixth leading cause of death worldwide [4] . Recent advancements in both robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) allowed forward strides in the domains of diagnostic and treatment [5] [6] [7] . In countries where they are employed, UGI cancer screening programs have significantly improved diagnostic rates and mortality indices [8] . Nevertheless, the detection rate of early UGI tract cancer, with conventional esophagogastroduodenoscopy, remains low [9] . Although new online learning platforms have been introduced to help gastroenterologists to master their diagnostic skills in endoscopic detection of early UGI tract disease and to allow for more favourable outcomes [10] , the roll-out of mass-screening is difficult and often hampered by a relatively low compliance rate [11] . Furthermore, meta-analyses demonstrated that around 10% of UGI cancers are missed during endoscopy exams performed within 3 years before diagnosis [12] [13] [14] . The diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities of UGI endoscopy strongly correlate with the technical and decision-making skills of the operator [15] , as well as other variables such as: (i) risk of communicable disease transmission, i.e., viral infections, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19, which is very infectious through aerosol; (ii) unaltered learning curves to achieve proficiency in endoscopic techniques; (iii) increasing numbers of physicians/nurses with burnout or endoscopy-related injuries [16] ; (iv) limited human and/or material resources; and (v) patients' perspectives on conventional endoscopy of the UGI tract that further interfere with the successful implementation and adoption of routine screening [17] . UGI robotic endoscopes, assisted by AI, can augment both the diagnostic and therapeutic capability, as well as the precision of endoscopic interventions. For example, such robotic platforms can calculate the force that should be applied to the GI tract wall, as well as perform movements in three-dimensional mode when using operative tools, hence decreasing the probability of adverse events [18] . Undoubtedly, the development of UGI endoscopy robotic platforms finds its natural application in the field of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). ESD requires a high level of endoscopic skill and control; consequently, its adoption in the field is slow. Although ESD has been initially linked with relatively high incidence of post-intervention complications [19] , the overall current outcomes are better than the ones of radical surgery [20, 21] . As ESD enables minimally invasive, successful and endoscopically complete (R0) removal of early gastric cancers and other malignant and non-malignant submucosal lesions located in the oesophagus or the stomach, it should be considered as the treatment of choice for certain early UGI tract disease [22, 23] . Robotics can enhance en bloc lesion removal and histological completeness of the endoscopic resection [19] ; therefore, ESD could accrue a second wave of wider adoption with a dedicated robotic support [18, 24] . Furthermore, Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES), as well as bariatric surgery, could benefit from robotic platforms, due to their functional versatility [25, 26] . Over recent years, many robotic endoscopes for the UGI tract have been designed and developed but only a few have reached the market [27] . Admittedly, robotic endoscopes are potentially costly and a niche market in healthcare provision; however, acquisition costs can be off-set by a higher precision in care delivery, and easier adoption of more precise endoscopic interventions [28] . In this review, authors will first present a short overview on current endoscopy practices for early detection of UGI cancerous and non-cancerous lesions followed by the recent advances and challenges in the field of robotic gastroscopy. We will focus on the early detection and follow up of these lesions in the practice of luminal GI endoscopy, and subsequently compare the capabilities of robotic technologies with contemporary basic quality requirements for standard endoscopy. We will also briefly discuss the limitations of current GI endoscopy practices at a time of pandemic and call for innovative solutions, including robotic (capsule) UGI screening platforms combined with telemedicine and remote healthcare services. This is clustered into five principal classes: (i) commercially available gastroscopes (Section 2); (ii) research-oriented robotic gastroscopes (Section 3); (iii) novel flexible robots for upper-GI tract surgery (Section 4); (iv) artificial intelligence in gastroscopy (Section 5), and (v) finally we will briefly discuss robotic UGI screening combined with remote healthcare services (Section 6).@story_separate@The progression to gastric cancer is preceded by chronic gastritis, gastric atrophy, gastric intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia. A crucial factor contributing to early detection of cancer and improved survival is non-invasively identifying those at risk [29] . The clinical data on the use of non-invasive biomarkers to identify patients with chronic atrophic gastritis is scarce with no data supporting a screening of the population. Therefore, a high-quality endoscope with complete mucosal visualization is an integral part in improving the early detection of UGI lesions. Image-enhanced endoscopy combined with biopsy sampling for histopathology is currently the best approach to detect and accurately risk-stratify patients at risk. Biopsies following the Sydney protocol from the antrum, incisura, lesser and greater curvature allow both diagnostic confirmation and risk stratification in regard to cancer progression [29] . Moreover, all UGI lesions should be endoscopically identified with measurable quality indicators, such as time recording, photo documentation, and the description of lesions utilizing standard terminology [30] . To this effect, several conventional gastroscopes with a wide range of technological features are available. Most modern UGI endoscopes from well-established manufacturers come with small diameter (<10 mm) and large bending angle (up to 210 degrees) ( Figure 1A ) [31] , allowing high-powered optical functions, e.g., powerful white light source, high-definition, near focus, auto-fluorescence imaging, narrow band imaging, spectral imaging colour enhancement-based modalities or even AI capabilities. A new exemplary is the disposable gastroscope free of disinfection procedure ( Figure 1B) . Of importance is that the position statements on quality standards in UGI endoscopy issued by the British Society of Gastroenterology, Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as other gastrointestinal societies [32] [33] [34] , aimed to reduce the variation in practice and standards between individual endoscopists and entire units by establishing a set of auditable key performance indicators [14] . In particular, these recommendations aim to optimize the diagnosis of early neoplasia and premalignant conditions, in order to favourably alter the natural history of UGI malignancies. Future robotic gastroscopes equipped with AI-based software modules could aim at a significant reduction in the variation of lesion assessment and reduce the bias associated with the human factor. Figure 1C ) [35] . The ingestible, disposable PillCam TM ESO has a small dimension (11 × 26 mm) , and its main feature was the presence of a second optical dome and an increased image acquisition frame rate (14 frame per second -FPS), as compared to conventional small-bowel WCEs (2 FPS). However, this is at the expense of a shorter battery life offering, therefore, limited inspection of the stomach and of the duodenum. The upgraded version, ESO2, has the same dimensions bur higher image acquisition frame rate (18 FPS); the operating time was increased to 30 min [36] . Over the years, the use of the ESO capsules has waxed and waned due to inferior image quality than conventional endoscopes, the lack of steerability and movement control, lack of air insufflation/aspiration and complex/variable patient movement protocols. Nevertheless, despite its inherent limitations, the principal contribution of this passive capsule device was the proof of concept that wireless examination of the UGI tract could be feasible and promising. Its successor, the improved version embodied in PillCam TM UGI, has been part of Medtronic Plc.'s (Dublin, Ireland) armamentarium since 2015. This novel device has similar dimensions (11.6 × 32.8 mm) with a wide field of view (172 degrees for each of the 2 cameras), an adjustable frame acquisition rate (4-35 FPS) and an operating time of 10 h [37] . The PillCam TM UGI capsule is, therefore, an attractive alternative to conventional gastroscopy as it can provide a discomfort-and  Alongside conventional and innovative flexible gastroscopes, several manufactures have developed passive wireless capsule endoscopes (WCEs). The first commercially available WCE for UGI screening, the PillCam TM ESO capsule, was introduced by Given Imaging Ltd. (Yokneam Illit, Israel) and received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in 2004 ( Figure 1C ) [35] . The ingestible, disposable PillCam TM ESO has a small dimension (11 × 26 mm), and its main feature was the presence of a second optical dome and an increased image acquisition frame rate (14 frame per second -FPS), as compared to conventional small-bowel WCEs (2 FPS).

The PillCam TM UGI capsule is, therefore, an attractive alternative to conventional gastroscopy as it can provide a discomfort-and sedation-free procedure. However, it still offers a limited view within the stomach due to a non-active control of the device, as in the previous versions of wireless capsule gastroscopes. Using an external magnetic field to steer and drive a WCE was one of the solutions proposed to improve the diagnostic performance. A complete gastric mucosal examination becomes possible by employing a navigation system that guides the active WCE for a more accurate and reliable control of the capsule gastroscope in the gastric cavity. The MiroCam-Navi system, developed by Intromedic Ltd. (Seoul, Korea), was designed by modifying the standard MiroCam ® SB capsule including a permanent magnet, hence allowing a controlled exploration of the gastric cavity ( Figure 1D ) [38] . Steering is controlled by a hand-held, hammer-like, permanent magnet and the images from the WCE are transmitted to a real-time viewing device via wireless communication from an external belt. The effectiveness of this device had been validated [42] . Hale et al. demonstrated that the MiroCam-Navi system had comparable detection rates with respect to conventional gastroscopes (89% versus 88%) in identifying beads sewn onto the mucosal surface of ex-vivo porcine stomachs [43] . Ankon Technologies Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, Shanghai, China) developed a magnetically controlled capsule endoscope (Navicam, MCE) aimed at exploring the stomach for gastric diseases screening ( Figure 1E ). It consists of a WCE, a magnetic-guidance robot, a data recorder and a computer workstation for real-time viewing and capsule navigation control. The safety and feasibility of the system has been validated by the stomach inspections of 34 human volunteers with the examination well accepted by these subjects without adverse events. A complete stomach examination takes on average 43.8 ± 10.0 min (range: 27-60 min) [39] . The examination of the stomach in 350 patients (mean age: 46.6 years), was performed safely and successfully, showing comparable accuracy with respect to conventional gastroscope. The MCE did not miss any significant lesions (including tumours and large ulcers) [44] . This system was clinically approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA mark-registration number: 20173223192) in 2013 and then obtained the European Union CE certification (CE mark) [45] . Using an updated version of this system, Ching et al. reported 100% views of the gastric cardia, fundus, greater and lesser curvature, anterior and posterior wall, antrum and pylorus, and furthermore, the capsule gastroscope could continue through peristalsis to image small intestine following the examination of stomach [46] . Another system, developed by Jinshan Science & Technology (Group) Co., Ltd. (Chongqing, China), is a magnetic robotic platform for gastroscopy, i.e., the OMOM Capsule Endoscopy platform. The system includes a disk-shaped permanent magnet controller held above an operating bed and a diagnostic capsule containing permanent magnets ( Figure 1F ) [40] . The OMOM capsule is light (i.e., 6 g), compact (i.e., 13 × 27.9 mm) and integrates a high-qualified image sensor (512 × 512 resolution, adaptive 2 to 6 FPS and field of view of 172 degrees). The high-performance Light Emitting Diode (LED) system ensures a wide and balanced light distribution and optimal illumination in a tubular environment. In addition, the battery life is more than 12 h. Furthermore, a standing type, magnetically controlled WCE system has been developed by JIFU Medical Technologies Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). It comprised a WCE, a guidance magnetic robot, and an imaging computer. It was also able to inspect the gastric cavity including the entire cardia and fundus and screen gastric illnesses without any anaesthesia ( Figure 1G ). A prospective multicentre, blinded study, that compared standing type magnetically controlled WCE with conventional gastroscope in patients, was carried out. Overall, the compliance rate was 94.41%, and 64 pathological outcomes were identified (50 outcomes were detected by both, 7 by standing type magnetically controlled WCE and 7 by conventional gastroscope). Standing type magnetically controlled WCE provides equivalent agreement with the gastroscope [41] . Gastroscopy remains a challenging procedure for patients and clinicians alike. Conventional endoscopy innovations, e.g., as ultrathin gastroscopes and trans-nasal endoscopy, allow an easier and distress-free approach. Therefore, further innovation and improvement of gastroscopes is an active area of research. Aside from the commercially available gastroscope, researchers seek to diagnose the gastric mucosa and propose innovative devices with alternative propulsion and bending mechanisms. In 2015, Caprara et al. introduced a flexible gastroscope driven by internal waterjet actuation (HydroJet capsule gastroscope- Figure 2A ) [47] . The system consisted of a swallowable capsule endoscope connected to an external water distribution system through a multi-channel soft tether. The camera, placed at the tip of the gastroscope, is oriented by activating the different waterjet channels with a variable pressure ejected from the capsule's head. The capsule was able to visualize the cavity of the stomach by combining waterjet actuation with adjustments of the length of the tether. The system, validate in ex-vivo conditions, took less than 8 min to visualize the essential points of a typical gastric screening procedure. Campisano et al. in 2017, as part of the same research team, proposed an updated version of the HydroJet capsule gastroscope able to provide gastric cavity inspection ( Figure 2B ) [48] . The diameter of the capsule is smaller than the previous one because of the reduction of the number of actuating jets from 6 to 3. Because of this modification, the efficiency of the jet actuators was greatly improved, requiring less water. The water distribution system and the soft connected tether were also redesigned and manufactured to reduce the friction between the tether and the human tissue, allowing a greater degree of control. The trial was carried out in an anatomically realistic human stomach phantom to validate the feasibility of retroflexion for this capsule within a confined space. Results indicated that the presented HydroJet gastroscope was able to fulfil the medical requirements of inspecting the stomach adequately, although the time taken to perform the procedure was longer than the conventional UGI endoscopy: the time differences are 162 s for novices and 624 s for experts.

[48] , and (C) Yin et al. [49] ; (D) Pneumatic gastroscope developed by Garbin et al. [50] ; (E) Cable driven gastroscope developed by Ye et al. [51] ; (F) Gastroscope modified by Swain et al. [52] ; Self-driven gastroscopes developed by (G) Tortora et al. [53] , and (H) De Falco et al. [54] ; (I) Magnetic steering devices developed cooperatively by Olympus Corp. (Tokyo, Japan) and Siemens Healthcare GmbH (Erlangen, Germany) [55] . Combining thermo-sensitive shape memory material, a braided structure, and a water ejecting actuation, Yin et al. designed in 2018 a prototype of a robotic gastroscope, which is able to bend and fix the temporary shape ( Figure 2C ) [49] . The system can achieve a large workspace (length of 160 mm and width of 150 mm) by controlling the direction and pressure of the waterjet and a remarkable structure stiffness variability (stiffness ratio between rigid state and soft state is 16) by controlling the temperature of the water. The structure could be fixed as the thermosensitive material switches from soft state to rigid state. Experimental results have shown that it required 15 s to decrease from 37 • C to 5 • C to be rigid, and approximately 12 s to soften the prototype. In the phantom experiment, this device took longer than the endoscope to complete a trial: the average time for completion of a single trial after training was 242 ± 13 s by a gastroenterologist. Differently from the Hydrojet solutions developed at the Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN, USA) [47, 48] , that were based on the coupling between the mechanical joystick and pneumatic drive, Garbin et al. developed in 2019, as part of the same research team, an intuitive handling and portable device for the visual inspection of the gastric cavity ( Figure 2D ) [50] . The proposed device adopted a multi-backbone continuum structure as the user interface and parallel bellows' actuators to manipulate the tip. The experiments in the human-like stomach phantom indicated that the device was able to efficiently find the LED markings of key anatomic landmarks. All landmarks were successfully identified with both endoscopes for all trials (n = 900). Clinicians performed the procedure in a shorter time with the conventional endoscope when compared to this device (24.48 s versus 37.13 s), but this difference is within the acceptable range for clinical operations. There was no significant time difference between platforms for novices, suggesting that there was no significant difference in time between learning to master the novel device as compared to the conventional gastroscopes. Finally, in 2017 Ye et al. presented a cable steered gastroscope, which consisted of an actuation section containing three motors, a thin and flexible tether with three super-elastic wires, and a retractable capsule base for installation of cameras ( Figure 2E ) [51] . With the lead screws, the rotation of the motors was transferred into the linear motion of the actuator rods, allowing bending in all directions to be achieved. This gastroscope was able to be extended to a distance of 40 mm and bend 360 degrees, radially, and up to 110 degrees, axially. In addition, the proposed gastroscope could be reconfigured to reach larger workspaces. Without the constraints of cables, capsule gastroscopes were able to move and make diagnoses less invasive than tethered gastroscopes, so patients will be more comfortable during the entire examination. In 2009, Tortora et al. presented a swallowable active capsule gastroscope composed of a supporting shell containing a wireless microcontroller, a battery and four brushed motors to activate rear independent propellers ( Figure 2G ) [53] . The diameter and the length of the device are 15 mm and 30 mm, respectively. The system was able to navigate in all directions in a water-filled area, achieving reliable locomotion and steering in the stomach. The capsule can guarantee diagnostic speed between 0 to 5-7 cm/s and is able to be actively controlled for more than 30 min at a selected diagnostic speed (i.e., 1.5 cm/s) with a mean current consumption below 40 mA. This system offered the potential for clinicians to inspect the gastric cavity in real-time. Through the human machine interface, clinicians will be able to control the capsule towards areas of interest using a triaxial joystick. The proposed system has been tested in in-vitro, ex-vivo and animal experiments. An advanced version of this capsule, with an embedded camera module, was developed by De Falco et al., as part of the same team, in 2014 ( Figure 2H ) [54] . The capsule gastroscope is 32 mm in length and 22 mm in diameter (still not suitable for being ingested), and it has been equipped with a miniaturized wireless vision system that acquires images with a frame rate up to 30 FPS. An explanted porcine stomach was used to evaluate the performance of the capsule in a compliant surrounding environment. The image transmission frame rate was 23-26 FPS in the ex-vivo environment, slightly lower than in in-vitro conditions due to the different tissue-interface. However, it was sufficient to allow real-time control of the active capsule and was higher than any other wireless vision system currently available. This capsule gastroscope has an operative lifetime at full charge of at least 13 min (i.e., with all components turned on and the transmission rate set at 30 FPS, that means a consumption of about 210 mA), close to the diagnostic operating time of the traditional gastroscopic examination. Before the commercial magnetically driven wireless gastroscopes were applied, in order to manipulate the wireless gastroscope more feasibly and precisely in the gastric cavity, in 2010, the capsule pioneer Prof. Paul Swain and his colleagues modified a PillCam TM WCE (Given Imaging Ltd., Yokneam Illit, Israel) to include neodymium-iron-boron magnets ( Figure 2F ) [52] . A handheld external magnet was used to manipulate this capsule gastroscope in the gastric cavity. The experiment indicated that the capsule gastroscope could be held and rotated at any positions in the stomach and moved back from pylorus to the cardio-oesophageal junction easily after the diagnosis. The safety and feasibility of the modified capsule gastroscope were validated in 2011. The magnetic manoeuvrable capsule was always attracted by the external magnetic paddle and responded to its movements; it remained in the stomach for 39 ± 24 min. In 7 subjects, both the cardia and the pylorus were inspected and 75% or more of the gastric mucosa was visualized. No adverse events were reported [56] . In 2010, a novel magnetic steering device for gastroscopy was developed cooperatively by Olympus Corp. (Tokyo, Japan) and Siemens Healthcare GmbH (Erlangen, Germany). The system included an Olympus Inc. WCE and a Siemens magnetic guidance equipment for interactively moving the capsule in the gastric cavity ( Figure 2I ) [55] . The capsule is controlled with a very low-intensity magnetic field (3-10 mT, 150 to 500 times smaller than that used for MRI) by the physicians using two joysticks and can be moved in the stomach with five independent degrees of freedom, i.e., translations, tilting and rotation. The in-vivo experiment in 53 subjects (29 volunteers and 24 patients) indicated that a sufficiently accurate gastric examination was feasible with this system: the technical success rate was 98%, and in the successful cases, examiners assessed that the antrum, body, fundus, and cardia were fully visualized in 98%, 96%, 73% and 75%, respectively. Mean duration of examinations was 30 min (range 8-50 min). The first blinded, comparative clinical trial in humans, which assesses the performance of magnetically guided capsule gastroscope versus a conventional high-definition gastroscope, was undertaken in 2011 in order to showcase the potentials of the wireless capsule gastroscope [57] . Visualization of the gastric pylorus, antrum, body, fundus, and cardia was evaluated as complete in 88.5%, 86.9%, 93.4%, 85.2%, and 88.5% of patients, respectively. Of the gastric lesions, 58.3% were detected by both gastroscopy and magnetically guided capsule endoscope at immediate assessment and review of recorded data. Capsule examination missed 14 findings and conventional gastroscopy missed 31 findings seen with magnetically guided capsule endoscope. Overall diagnostic yield was similar for both the modalities. Finally, in 2012, Kósa et al. also developed an MRI-driven swimming capsule robot which had the potential application of inspecting the gastric cavity [58] . Two propelling methods, based on the MRI magnet, were tested and it was demonstrated that the high magnetic field of the MRI allows propulsion speed on the order of several millimetres per second. The increasing sophistication of robotic platforms, from experimental to commercially available systems, has fed the ongoing evolution of what is surgically possible. A drive towards minimally invasive procedures led to a desire for NOTES, ""scar-less"" surgery. Robotic NOTES is a natural progression of this. NOTES grants transluminal access to the peritoneal cavity with the aim of a ""scar-less"" intervention [59, 60] . This is a fusion of surgical and endoscopic techniques and to achieve this requires a fine degree of accuracy and precision. Apart from NOTES, several articulated robots with surgical functionalities for UGI applications have been developed in the last year and are summarized in this section, after introducing the conventional gastric surgery features. Traditional surgical procedures, including the treatment of UGI cancers, are increasingly finding endoscopic alternatives. Specifically, ESD for the removal of early gastric cancers has been shown to be safer and more effective compared to conventional surgery, when performed by expert operators [61] . Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty showed significantly less adverse events and good clinical outcomes [62] , although it reported a less weight loss compared to the conventional laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy [63] . Patients had significantly lower rates of adverse events compared with the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ones (5.2% vs. 16.9%); the body weight loss ratio (compared with baseline) was also lower in the endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty group compared with the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy group (17.1 ± 6.5% vs. 23.6 ± 7.6%). Per-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM), as a treatment, has been suggested to be superior to Heller myotomy in short term efficacy for treating achalasia [64] . Although these are mature technologies, international experience is variable, and services are slowly developing to offer these as alternatives procedures for patients [65] . Given the time-consuming nature and skills required for these advanced endoscopic procedures, they are an appealing target for robotic assistance. Robotics for UGI applications is predominantly centred around access, stability, and instrumentation. Various methods have been attempted and are in ongoing development. For the UGI surgery, devices predominantly have two arms mounted on the tip of a flexible endoscope. These are operated independently and often require a second operator to control and act as the surgeons two hands for the procedure [66] . The EndoMaster's robotic system (EndoMaster Pte, Ltd., Singapore) is based on a master device remotely controlling the surgical ""slave"" devices, through an endoscope ( Figure 3A ). This has been used for human gastric ESD, operated remotely, with favourable outcomes in 2012 [67] . The mean submucosal dissection time was 18.6 min (median of 16 min, range between 3-50 min). No perioperative complications were encountered. However, it has not yet been granted FDA or CE marks approval because of the questions in sterilization procedures [68] . Potential virus or bacterial residues can cause cross-infection, especially when infectious diseases, e.g., COVID-19, are prone to pandemics. with surgical functionalities for UGI applications have been developed in the last year and are summarized in this section, after introducing the conventional gastric surgery features.

Potential virus or bacterial residues can cause cross-infection, especially when infectious diseases, e.g. COVID-19, are prone to pandemics. The ENDOSAMURAI™ from Olympus Medical Systems Corp. (Tokyo, Japan) has arms mounted on the end of the endoscope ( Figure 3B ). An overtube can then be used to stabilize the system allowing for more precise actions [69] . This device has been used to perform a number of procedures in animal studies including intra-abdominal exploration and transgastric small bowel resection [73] . In in-vivo conditions, the total time of the procedure, from the beginning of the resection until the completion of the anastomosis in small bowel wall, was on average 110 min (range: 90-125 min) and leak pressure was 53 mmHg. The direct drive endoscopic system (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) uses arms mounted on an overtube device, requiring two operators: one to perform a conventional endoscopy and one to manage the arms. This has been used in anaesthetised pigs for endoscopic mucosal resection [74] . It took at least 1 h and 26 min to perform the endoscopic mucosal resection. No complications of bleeding, perforation or hemodynamic compromise occurred. Inspection of the excised stomach showed no full thickness damage or serosal changes. The i 2 Snake robotic platform has 4 channels within a robotic arm, which allows for 2 robotic instruments, a camera and a light source [70, 71] . This system was designed for Ear-Nose-Throat procedures but has potential for more complicated procedures, such as ESD or POEM ( Figure 3C ). The robot showed high repeatability in executing the task with a standard deviation of 1.3 mm around the mean retroflexion trajectory, and a maximum displacement of 2.5 mm. The flexible robot is able to reach a complete retroflexion within a diameter of 110 mm. The Flex ® Robotic System (Medrobotics Corp., Raynham, MA, USA) ( Figure 3D ) uses a transoral approach for operations of the oropharynx and primarily for the Ear-Nose-Throat procedure. This endoluminal robot is an operator controlled flexible endoscope system that includes a rigid endoscope and computer-assisted controllers, with two external channels for the use of compatible 3.5 mm flexible instruments [72] . Epiglottectomies were successfully performed and the average time of the procedure was 42 min (number of trials is 5, standard deviation is 28 min) [75] . Robotic assistance with flexible endoscopes for increasingly complex UGI surgery is a rapidly expanding field and there are several competing lines. There are hurdles to overcome in finding the optimal system, which is driving the ongoing evolution of these robotic devices. Over 10% of cancers within the UGI tract are missed on endoscopy [12] . This is clearly a concern for endoscopists and patients, making computer-aided diagnostics (CAD) an appealing mechanism to minimize these missed lesions. ""Hand crafted"" algorithms allow characteristic features of a lesion to be programmed so that these can be ""recognized"" by the system. Deep learning algorithms for image recognition, by comparison, begin to allow an automated extraction of these patterns [76] . Increasingly complex convolutional neural networks (CNNs) allow grouping of images by similarities, leading to classification and ""recognition"". The main targets within the UGI tract so far have been Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal and gastric cancer and helicobacter infection [76, 77] . Using this technique for the image recognition of gastric cancer results in a superior diagnostic accuracy compared to non-expert endoscopists, and similar to the expert ones [78] . At present, systems are sensitive to abnormality but have poor specificity of picking out relevant mucosal change [79] . Using deep learning, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity improve with the increase of balanced data. Although it would be less likely to perform better than a highly skilled endoscopist, if he/she is not fatigued and if he/she is in a non-distracting environment, AI may represent an important diagnostic aiding tool. Indeed, AI can guarantee a high reproducibility and scalability, paying the way for a standardization of diagnostic outcomes with a possible reduction of costs due to the extensive and required training programs. In Barrett's oesophagus, images containing neoplasia were recognized with more specificity and sensitivity by a CAD system than a human endoscopist [80] . For oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma deep learning through CNNs results in rapid image analysis with 98% sensitivity. Again, the specificity was relatively poor. The CNN was also able to distinguish between superficial and advanced disease with an accuracy of 98% [81] . Such systems are aimed at improving detection of early neoplasia for a real-time clinical use [82, 83] . Given the high miss rate for precancerous lesions and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the introduction of CAD is highly desirable. In helicobacter detection, machine learning algorithms have been seen to be more sensitive and specific than a human endoscopist, with a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 86.7%, compared to 75% and 63% demonstrated in studies using conventional endoscopy [84, 85] . Moreover, a CNN-based computer-aided detection has been recently developed for a better assessment of tissue invasion depth in early gastric cancer achieving 89.16% of accuracy and 76.47% of specificity [86] . WCE often requires lengthy manual review of many thousands of images; CNNs have been suggested to have 100% sensitivity and specificity in recognizing coeliac disease from controls [87] . Their ability to rapidly analyses images, without fatigue makes this an ideal platform. As such, CAD could be effectively utilized to reduce the workload in capsule endoscopy. Potentially, if coupled with other technologies, such as a magnetic capsule endoscope, AI could be used to create a minimally invasive diagnostic test for the UGI tract and minimize the need for the physician's input. Primarily, CAD is used as an aid to the endoscopist in the hope that fewer lesions will be missed, especially by non-expert endoscopists. Differences have allowed a faster development and clinical application of AI in the lower GI tract [76] . The higher incidence of cancers and clear-cut dysplasia isolated on lower GI surveillance allowed a large databank to be gathered for learning quickly. The nature of dysplasia within the lower GI tract is often more easily distinguished, with a well demarcated polyp formation. This compared to the UGI tract, in which dysplasia is often formed on the background of an inflammation or on abnormal tissue, which is more difficult to distinguish [88] [89] [90] [91] . Although it has taken longer to build AI and CAD for the UGI tract, this is also following rapidly and will benefit of what is already performed today for the lower GI tract. The potential for this automated machine learning in AI seems limitless, but there are difficulties in real world implementation, which could soon be overcome with the new collaboratively conducted prospective and multicentre studies, obtaining large scale and high-quality image data [92] . Examples of such trials can be found in the ""clinicaltrials.gov-National Institute of Health (NIH)"" registry, including very recent, cohort, prospective, randomized multicentre studies of AI-assisted digestive endoscopy, aimed at recruiting 3600 participants in China [93] . As such AI could truly improve the quality of UGI investigation and the detection of UGI lesions as it has already shown to outperform humans in endoscopic image recognition. The impact of suspended elective endoscopy procedures at this time of the current COVID-19 pandemic could significantly affect gastrointestinal health [94, 95] . With this in mind, the new consensus guidance using the modified Delphi process aimed to facilitate a rapid and safe reopening of global endoscopy services has been recently developed [94] . However, the threat of healthcare-associated infections and the recent lockdown of endoscopy provision due to SARS-CoV-2 has prompted a careful look into other ways of dealing with endoscopy requests [96] . UGI endoscopy remains an aerosol-generating procedure, due to the potential for retching, coughing and open airway suction use. It is therefore one of the main areas where new processes and protocol are needed [97] . In the midst of the pandemic, forgotten or new pathways and protocols have been brushed up and discussions about employing new, distance-retaining, non-aerosol generating procedures are much alive. Apart from recent universally accepted consensus statements to guide the recovery of endoscopy units in the COVID-19 era, there is certainly a renewed interest in robotic and telemedicine provisions in gastroenterology. However, even now telemedicine seems still limited to follow-up care of patients with inflammatory bowel and liver disease [98, 99] . In the light of recent developments in the field of mobile-cloud-assisted, wireless body sensors and remote robotic endoscopic technologies, patients could undergo a spectrum of various diagnostic procedures amid their daily routines [100] [101] [102] . Internet-based remote visit has been proofed as an effective and safe option to deliver care at a distance, limiting the risks of infection [103] ; a detailed description of wireless body sensors is out of the scope of this review and has been extensively reviewed in [104, 105] . The web-based, patient-doctor communication tools enable data and video transfer and analysis centralizing the resources of the medical experts with a consequential significant reduction of capital expenditure [106] . This model enables adoption of future innovations, such as Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, smart healthcare, robotics, AI-based video analysis and remote consultation ( Figure 4) . The development of different IoT sensors may enhance the current endoscopy techniques and allow for remote and real-time functioning of modern endoscopy centres [107] . Together with smart health-care concept, it allows for robotic equipment to provide remote monitoring and diagnosis of patients in real-time [104] . Future 5G communication networks and smart miniaturized antennas will facilitate the widespread use of these concepts. Robotic gastroscopes and other next-generation endoscopic devices could supplement medical diagnosis in various locations, including nursing and patients' own homes [108, 109] .

Probably, the current pandemic will affect how medical healthcare functions for a long time, which calls for innovation and thinking outside the box. In the era of a growing number of patients with oncologic and other non-communicable and communicable diseases, the practice of gastroenterology needs novel solutions.

In the era of a growing number of patients with oncologic and other non-communicable and communicable diseases, the practice of gastroenterology needs novel solutions. As minimal-contact robotic platforms are already available, their further development and implementation into running endoscopy programs are essential. UGI tract disorders are among the most common diseases worldwide. Gastric and oesophageal cancers are both internationally common but also carry a poor prognosis when compared to many other malignancies. Therefore, it is of great benefit to patients that biological tissue abnormalities can be diagnosed and treated in the early stage. The diagnosis and treatment schemes using gastroscopes, as the main tool in UGI tract, have been continuously developed because of its easy access to the human body. Up to now, there are various devices, both commercially available and at mature research levels, for treatment of the UGI tract. Commercial gastroscopes are mostly conventional manually actuated tethered gastroscopes and capsule gastroscopes. So far, manually actuated tethered gastroscopes are generally driven by cables, with a relatively small diameter and a hand-held control. However, it is common to cause discomfort to the patient while inserting them into the digestive tract. The commercially available robotic gastroscopes-potentially inspired by research examples-are mainly magnetically actuated capsule gastroscopes, which can easily negotiate the gastric cavity without discomfort or sedation for patients. In addition to commercially available gastroscopes, researchers have been proposing innovative devices with alternative propulsion and bending mechanisms. The gastroscopes with soft-tether are mainly driven by the HydroJet-based, cables, and pneumatic mechanisms, whereas the wireless gastroscopes consist of self-driven capsule gastroscopes and magnetically actuated ones. The research-oriented gastroscopes explore more possibilities and future applications. In addition to describing the technical features of robotic gastroscopes, this review article also details the outcomes of these devices in clinical practices. Both the technical features and clinical outcomes of robotic gastroscopes support clinicians and researchers to have further room for application and development. In addition to diagnosis, the gastroscope also expands into the field of treatment and surgery. This article also discusses some of the robotic surgical devices used for UGI complex interventions. The performance of various surgical instruments was compared, and the current status quo was deeply considered. We are now in an era full of changes, and these have exceeded the expectations of most of us. The most relevant fact, at present, is that new sources of infection, e.g., SARS-CoV-2, are interrupting our normal living conditions, and also medical conditions. Embracing these changes with a positive attitude could lead to further development in the future, giving us a greater possibility to improve the quality of life for society. The use of the robotic gastroscope has greatly enhanced the diagnosis and surgery of the UGI tract, allowing higher accuracy and visualization capabilities. However, more in-depth research based on the current status quo will definitely improve the performance. Digitalization, telemedicine and AI are intense development trends in recent years. The combination of AI and robotic gastroscopes will undoubtedly make diagnosis and treatment more intelligent. The large-scale application of robotics and AI can effectively solve the ""social and medical distance"" problem at this stage. It can reduce the frequency of contact or even realize ""zero"" contact on the premise of ensuring the diagnosis and surgical effect. Furthermore, in low-and middle-income countries, the significance is far beyond that. Due to the long-term lack of medical resources (especially expert doctors), diagnostic and therapeutic services only cover a very limited population. The promotion of AI-assisted and teleoperated robotic gastroscopes will allow more people to have access to an efficient, standardized, and reliable diagnosis and surgery.

Correspondingly, robotic gastroscopes with advanced functionalities, e.g., disposable, dextrous and not invasive solutions, have been developed in the last years. This article extensively reviews these novel devices and describes their functionalities and performance. In addition, the implementation of artificial intelligence technology into robotic gastroscopes, combined with remote telehealth endoscopy services, are discussed. The aim of this paper is to provide a clear and comprehensive view of contemporary robotic gastroscopes and ancillary technologies to support medical practitioners in their future clinical practice but also to inspire and drive new engineering developments. ABSTRACT: Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract pathology is common worldwide. With recent advancements in robotics, innovative diagnostic and treatment devices have been developed and several translational attempts made. This review paper aims to provide a highly pictorial critical review of robotic gastroscopes, so that clinicians and researchers can obtain a swift and comprehensive overview of key technologies and challenges. Therefore, the paper presents robotic gastroscopes, either commercial or at a progressed technology readiness level. Among them, we show tethered and wireless gastroscopes, as well as devices aimed for UGI surgery. The technological features of these instruments, as well as their clinical adoption and performance, are described and compared. Although the existing endoscopic devices have thus far provided substantial improvements in the effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment, there are certain aspects that represent unwavering predicaments of the current gastroenterology practice. A detailed list includes difficulties and risks, such as transmission of communicable diseases (e.g., COVID-19) due to the doctor–patient proximity, unchanged learning curves, variable detection rates, procedure-related adverse events, endoscopists’ and nurses’ burnouts, limited human and/or material resources, and patients’ preferences to choose non-invasive options that further interfere with the successful implementation and adoption of routine screening. The combination of robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as remote telehealth endoscopy services, are also discussed, as viable solutions to improve existing platforms for diagnosis and treatment are emerging."
"For centuries, influenza virus has plagued humankind. While influenza infection typically causes mild-to-moderate illness in healthy individuals, it still results in 30,000-40,000 deaths per year in the United States. Those most susceptible to influenza infection are infants, the elderly, and those individuals that are immunocompromised due to HIV/AIDS infection or organ/tissue transplant (CDC, 2006) . In extreme cases, such as the 1918 pandemic, it is estimated that 50 million people died as a result of influenza infection (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006) . What was unique about this pandemic is that the most susceptible to this disease were young, otherwise healthy, individuals. Since 1918, multiple influenza pandemics have occurred, although none nearly as deadly. Another influenza pandemic is inevitable and much effort is being placed on disease surveillance and monitoring of transmission across species (Pandemic Flu, 2007; Subbarao and Joseph, 2007) . Of particular concern is the H5N1 family of avian influenza viruses (Horimoto and Kawaoka, 2005) . While the transmission rate of H5N1 viruses from birds to humans is extremely low, the case mortality rate in humans is greater than 50% (WHO, 2007) . Fortunately, human-tohuman transmission is extremely rare (WHO, 2005) . It is difficult to predict for how long this will be the case and there is increasing concern that H5N1 viruses will recombine with human viruses. This could result in an H5N1 virus with the capacity for human-to-human transmission and perhaps generate a catastrophic pandemic (Subbarao and Joseph, 2007) . Understanding the ways in which influenza interacts with the host is an important component of preparing for the next pandemic. It is necessary to understand these interactions in order to improve existing vaccines, to develop new and more efficacious vaccines that will provide protection against multiple strains and subtypes, and to develop new antiviral therapeutics (Subbarao and Joseph, 2007) . Because of its ability to provide a global view, functional genomics is one of the most useful approaches for studying virus-host interactions. Our laboratory is using functional genomics to study a variety of viruses, including HCV, SIV/HIV, Ebola virus, HSV, SARS coronavirus, West Nile virus, and influenza virus (Baas et al., 2006a,b; Baskin et al., 2004; Fredericksen et al., 2004; Geiss et al., 2000 Geiss et al., , 2001 Geiss et al., , 2002 Geiss et al., , 2003 Kash et al., 2004 Kash et al., , 2006a Kobasa et al., 2007; Lederer et al., 2006; Pasieka et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2003a Smith et al., ,b, 2006 Thomas et al., 2006; Walters et al., 2006 Walters et al., , 2006a . This chapter will focus on how microarray technology is being utilized to uncover the mysteries of influenza pathogenesis. We will explore increasingly complex models for studying influenza-host interactions using functional genomics, including cell culture systems, murine models of infection, and nonhuman primates (Fig. 1) . Finally, we will discuss the promise of using genomics to define molecular signatures of the disease that could lead to the evolution of the microarray as a diagnostic tool.@story_separate@increasing use of this approach to study virus-host interactions using a variety of model systems. For example, data obtained using microarray technology, in combination with mouse and macaque infection models, is providing exciting new insights into the pathogenicity of the 1918 virus. These studies suggest that the lethality associated with this virus is in part due to an aberrant and unchecked immune response. Progress is also being made toward using functional genomics in the diagnosis and prognosis of acute lung infections and in the development of more effective influenza vaccines and antivirals. A. Cell culture models Initial functional genomic endeavors in our laboratory utilized established cell lines to understand the ways in which influenza virus disrupts cellular processes. We first performed a series of experiments to determine replication-dependent and -independent events during influenza infection. HeLa cells were mock infected or infected with either active or heat-inactivated A/WSN/33 (H1N1). Using the dual-labeling technique, cDNA arrays were hybridized with RNA from mock versus active or heat-inactivated virus or with RNA from heat-inactivated versus active virus, allowing us to determine which genes were regulated by actively replicating virus (Geiss et al., 2001) . We found that while there are distinct subsets of genes whose regulation is replication dependent or independent, more gene expression changes were observed in the presence of replicating virus. Further analysis revealed that these genes could be classified in five major categories: protein synthesis, cytokine and growth factor signaling, transcription factors and DNA-binding proteins, processing and export of mRNA, and the ubiquitin pathway. In contrast, genes whose regulation was replication independent were grouped representative of the following categories: metallothioneins, cell cycle related, transcriptional regulators, part of the ubiquitin pathway, or cellular kinases (Geiss et al., 2001) . Although specific aspects of influenza replication-independent and -dependent events could have been assessed using conventional laboratory techniques, our gene expression studies allowed us to examine numerous gene expression changes at the same time. From this data, it was possible to identify specific processes that are related to influenza replicationindependent and -dependent events and speculate on how these events work together in influenza pathogenesis. Further studies using a cell culture system were aimed at discerning viral determinants of virulence. Of particular interest was the viral NS 1 protein. NS 1 appears to play a role in subverting the host response to the virus. It has been suggested that NS 1 attenuates the interferon response to the virus through its double-stranded (ds) RNA-binding domain . It has also been suggested that the dsRNA-binding domain of NS 1 functions to inhibit the 2 0 5 0 -OAS/RNaseL antiviral response (Min and Krug, 2006) . This may indicate that NS 1 from different influenza viruses plays distinct roles in subverting the host response to the virus. To better understand the effect of NS 1 on virus-host interactions, we infected an established human lung epithelial cell line, A549, with A/PR/ 8/34 (H1N1), A/PR/8/34 in which NS 1 was deleted, or with A/PR/8/34 in which NS 1 contained a deletion in the C-terminus (Geiss et al., 2002) . The latter two viruses were reconstructed using plasmid-based reverse genetics (Fodor et al., 1999) . These studies allowed us to examine the global host response to influenza infection in the absence of NS 1 or in response to infection with a virus exhibiting attenuated NS 1 function. Numerous genes were preferentially upregulated in response to infection with the mutant viruses compared to the parental strain. Many of these genes were related to the antiviral and interferon responses. These data suggest a role for the NS 1 of A/PR/8/34 as an antagonist of the interferon response to the virus (Geiss et al., 2002) . Antagonism of this crucial defense response to influenza most likely contributes to the lethality of this virus in mice. Therefore, these initial studies from our laboratory were crucial in understanding the importance of the interferon response in the host response to influenza. This study was also the first to use functional genomics to examine the role of specific genes from the 1918 strain. In addition to the viruses mentioned above, A549 cells were infected with A/WSN/33 or a recombinant in which the NS 1 of A/WSN/33 was replaced with the NS 1 from the 1918 virus. We noted that there was greater suppression of interferonstimulated genes in cells infected with the 1918 NS 1 recombinant virus than in cells infected with the parental strain. The host response to A/WSN/33 virus containing the 1918 NS 1 was also compared with the response to wild-type A/PR/8/34 and with the A/PR/8/34 NS 1 mutant viruses. From these analyses, we determined that the expression of numerous interferon-stimulated genes was anti-correlated between these viruses and A/WSN/33 containing the 1918 NS 1 . For example, NMI and STAT1 expression were upregulated in cells infected with the A/PR/8/34 viruses but downregulated in cells infected with A/WSN/33 containing the NS 1 from the 1918 virus. These studies suggest that the NS 1 from the 1918 virus is more adept at suppressing key interferon responses. It will be interesting to use functional genomics to compare the effect of the NS 1 from the 1918 virus on host-virus interactions to that of the NS 1 s from modern day low pathogenicity human influenza viruses and both low and high pathogenicity avian H5N1 viruses. Such comparisons will lend a global view into how different influenza NS 1 s affect the host response and lead to important observations as to the role of NS 1 in influenza pathogenicity (Geiss et al., 2002) . Interestingly, mice infected with a virus containing the NS 1 of 1918 and the other seven genes from A/WSN/33 did not succumb to the infection. In contrast, all mice infected with A/WSN/33 died by 10 days postinfection (Basler et al., 2001) . These data, in conjunction with the array studies described above, suggest that the NS 1 of the 1918 virus is an important virulence factor, but it is not solely responsible for the high lethality of the 1918 virus. Therefore, it was imperative to study the effect of other 1918 genes on mortality and examine the critical interplay of all of the 1918 genes. Such studies will be discussed in the following section covering murine models of influenza infection. Using cell culture systems in the application of functional genomics is crucial to the understanding of how influenza infection affects antiviral responses on the cellular level. However, these systems are limited in that the data obtained from them can only lead to inferences as to what is occurring in the host as a whole. For this reason, it is necessary to study influenza infection in the context of the whole organism. The use of functional genomics in conjunction with various mammalian models of infection, and in humans, will be discussed in the next sections. In order to study the effects of influenza in the context of the whole organism, many scientists have utilized mouse models of infection. Although mice are not a natural host for influenza virus, their accessibility and the vast repertoire of genetically altered species makes them a useful tool in many areas of research, including functional genomics. Since laboratory strains of mice are inbred, this reduces host variation, making it easier to clarify how influenza is affecting the host. Of particular interest to our laboratory is how the host response induced by highly pathogenic influenza infection differs from that induced by viruses with lower pathogenicity. Of all the influenza viruses that have surfaced in the last century, very few have caused as much intrigue as the 1918 pandemic strain. Among the most perplexing questions surrounding the influenza pandemic of 1918 is what made this virus so deadly. Environmental, biological, or demographic factors could have contributed to its virulence; however, the most pertinent factors may be related to how this virus interacts with the host innate immune response. As mentioned in the previous section, we used functional genomics to study the effect of the 1918 NS 1 on global gene expression using a cell culture system. While this study provided an important first step in understanding this deadly virus, it only hints at what might be occurring in the whole host. With the sequencing and reconstruction of the 1918 virus using reverse genetics (Tumpey et al., 2005a) , our laboratory and others have been able to study the effects of various genes from this virus and the fully reconstructed virus on the host (Basler et al., 2001; Reid et al., 1999 Reid et al., , 2000 Reid et al., , 2002 Reid et al., , 2004 Taubenberger, 1998; Taubenberger et al., 1997) . In initial studies, we infected mice with the lethal, A/WSN/33 stain or with a recombinant of this virus containing the HA and NA from the 1918 virus. A recombinant A/WSN/33 virus containing the HA and NA of a contemporary human strain (A/New Caledonia/99) was also included in these studies. Both HA and NA are major virulence factors and HA is the major viral factor against which host antibodies are produced (Lamb and Krug, 1996) and evidence suggests that the HA of the 1918 virus is necessary for transmission (Tumpey et al., 2007) . Gene expression profiling was then performed on lungs isolated from these mice. Increased gene expression in the lungs of mice infected with either A/WSN/33 or the recombinant virus containing the HA and NA from the 1918 virus was observed at 24 h postinfection. In contrast, relatively few gene expression changes were observed in the lungs of mice infected with the A/WSN/33 recombinant strain containing the HA and NA from A/New Caledonia/33. By 72 h postinfection, gene expression changes were similar between the two infection groups, indicating that the HA and NA of the 1918 virus were sufficient to accelerate the host response to the virus (Kash et al., 2004) . A subset of genes was preferentially upregulated in mice infected with the A/WSN/33 recombinant virus containing the 1918 HA and NA. Among this group were genes that are indicative of T cell activation, macrophage activation, and cell death (Kash et al., 2004) . In support of these findings, Tumpey et al. demonstrated that mice infected with A/Texas/36/91 containing the HA and NA from the 1918 virus or with A/WSN/33 containing these genes developed severe lung pathology, including varying degrees of necrotizing bronchitis, alveolitis, and pulmonary edema. Strikingly, there was also an increase in neutrophils and alveolar macrophages in the lungs of these animals. To analyze the importance of these immune cells in the context of A/Texas/36/91 recombinant virus, animals in which neutrophils and/or alveolar macrophages had been depleted were infected with a sublethal dose of the virus. Infected neutrophil-depleted mice had a 60% survival rate. In contrast, all animals in which alveolar macrophages or both alveolar macrophages and neutrophils were depleted died by 9 days postinfection with the recombinant virus (Tumpey et al., 2005b) . Taken together, these data emphasize the importance of certain immune mediators in combating infection with a recombinant virus containing the HA and NA from the 1918 virus. However, as discussed below, these findings also suggest that an inappropriate activation of the host response to the virus may contribute to its pathogenicity. We have also used functional genomics to analyze the host response of mice infected with the fully reconstructed 1918 virus. These studies, led by John Kash, revealed that genes related to various immune cells, notably NK cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and T helper 1 (Th1) cells, were upregulated in mice infected with the fully reconstructed 1918 virus as early as 1 day postinfection. These genes were persistently activated in the lungs of r1918-infected mice throughout the course of the experiment (5 days) (Kash et al., 2006b) . Key mediators of the immune response to influenza virus are cytokines and chemokines that are responsible for the activation of and recruitment of immune cells into the infected tissue (Julkunen et al., 2001) . In agreement with early and persistent activation of immune cells in r1918-infected mice, this same gene expression pattern was observed for genes related to pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as Tnf, Il6, and Ccl5 (Kash et al., 2006b) . It is crucial that a delicate balance of immune responses is maintained during infection in order to limit excessive damage to the host. If these responses go unchecked, or are insufficient, it can result in dire consequences for the host (La Gruta et al., 2007) . Our data suggest that a hyperactive and persistent host response is associated with the 1918 virus and that this is a key contributor to the high mortality associated with this virus. Another important aspect of our study was an examination of what effect the full constellation of genes from the 1918 virus had on gene expression and virus-induced morbidity and mortality. In order to accomplish this, mice were infected with the fully reconstructed 1918 virus (r1918), with A/Texas/91/36 containing the HA and NA from 1918 (2:6 1918), or with A/Texas/91/36 containing the HA, NA, M, NP, and NS 1 genes from the 1918 virus (5:3 1918) (Fig. 2) . Compared with the response of mice infected with the r1918 virus, which exhibited early and persistent upregulation of genes related to NK cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and T helper 1 (Th1) cells, mice infected with either the 5:3 1918 or 2:6 1918 virus exhibited a delay in the upregulation of these genes. However, expression levels of genes related to these immune cells was similar in all three 1918 recombinant viruses by day 5 postinfection. Interestingly, animals infected with either the 5:3 1918 virus or the 2:6 1918 virus exhibited lung pathology intermediate to mice infected with A/Texas/91/36 and those infected with r1918 at day 3 postinfection. The differences in gene expression not only correlated with lung pathology, but also with viral titers and morbidity, demonstrating the usefulness of gene expression profiling in understanding molecular mechanisms of disease and disease outcome (Kash et al., 2006b) . Studies in our laboratory are now focusing on combining genomics with the use of knockout or transgenic mice to further understand the complex host-virus interactions that occur in response to infection with the 1918 virus. We are also interested in using genomics to examine the effects of H5N1 infection on mice and to determine if there are molecular signatures of disease that are present as a consequence of infection with highly pathogenic strains of influenza. In addition, we are taking advantage of the vast repertoire of transgenic and knockout mice available to gain further insight into key regulators of the innate and/or adaptive immune response to influenza infection in general. For example, in collaboration with Michael Gale, we are working to understand the role of the pattern recognition receptor, retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), during influenza infection. RIG-I plays an important role in the interferon response to many viruses, including influenza Fredericksen and Gale, 2006; Kato et al., 2005 Kato et al., , 2006 Liu et al., 2007; Sumpter et al., 2005; Yoneyama et al., 2005 Yoneyama et al., , 2004 . We recently examined the gene expression profiles in RIG-I deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) infected with A/PR/8/34. Global gene expression profiles revealed significant differences in gene expression between wildtype and RIG-I deficient MEFs. We are in the process of furthering analyzing data, but preliminary analyses have revealed an important role for RIG-I in the host response to the virus (Loo et al., submitted). Even though mouse models have provided critical insights into the pathogenesis of influenza, the information gained from these studies is limited since mice are not natural hosts for the virus. For this reason, data obtained from mouse studies can be difficult to translate to human infection. Numerous studies have utilized nonhuman primate models to study influenza pathogenesis (Berendt, 1974; Grizzard et al., 1978; Liu et al., 1997; Rimmelzwaan et al., 2001; van Riel et al., 2006) . Unlike mouse models of infection, influenza infection in nonhuman primate models mimics human infection. For example, nonhuman primates can be infected with human influenza strains without prior adaptation and the virus is transmissible between animals. In addition, nonhuman primates and humans are close evolutionary relatives. As a consequence, nonhuman primates are increasingly being utilized to examine influenza pathogenesis, and with the sequencing of the rhesus macaque genome (Rhesus macaque genome sequencing and analysis consortium, 2007), genomic and proteomic resources for working with these animals are becoming progressively more available (Magness et al., 2005; Spindel et al., 2005; Wallace et al., 2007) . Although there are numerous advantages to using nonhuman primates in influenza research, certain considerations must be taken before working with them. Nonhuman primates exhibit host variation similar to that in humans, a factor that needs to be taken into account when analyzing genomics data. Additionally, the numbers of nonhuman primates available for research are limited. Therefore, most nonhuman primate studies are restricted in their sample size. Lastly, considerable ethical concerns must be taken into account when using nonhuman primates in research studies. Our laboratory, along with others, has diligently worked to address these concerns and yet still obtain the insights into influenza-host interactions that only studies in nonhuman primates can provide. In a seminal study led by Carole Baskin, pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) were infected with the reconstructed H1N1 human influenza strain, A/Texas/36/91. Physical symptoms, such as throat inflammation, loss of appetite, and weight loss, correlated with the upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes at days 4 and 7 postinfection. Gene expression profiling also revealed the upregulation of genes related to neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage function. Accordingly, an influx of neutrophils and macrophages into the lungs of infected monkeys was observed. Although not the first to use nonhuman primates as a model of influenza infection, this study was unique for two reasons. It was the first to use pigtailed macaques and it was the first in which functional genomics was used to examine influenza infection in nonhuman primates (Baskin et al., 2004) . To expand upon the above study, we have also employed functional genomics to assess the effect of influenza infection on the early innate immune response in the lungs of pigtailed macaques, how genes related to this response were regulated over time, and whether gene expression signatures of infection could also be detected in the blood. Finally, we examined the correlation between genomic and proteomic data collected for both lung and PBMC samples. Significantly, this study was also the first to use macaque-specific oligonucleotide arrays, which were developed in our laboratory (Wallace et al., 2007) . As in the previous study, animals were infected with A/Texas/36/91. Subsequent analysis focused on gene expression changes present at day 2 postinfection in order to determine molecular correlates of early influenza infection. In lesions where viral mRNA was present, there was increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes and antiviral-related genes. Notably, the majority of these genes were significantly upregulated, suggesting a robust host response against the virus. Differential expression of cytokine, chemokine, and immune-related genes was also present in samples isolated at 7 days postinfection (Baas et al., 2006a) . These data indicate a robust and sustained host response in the lungs of influenza-infected pigtail macaques. We also compared the signatures of infection in the lung with those found in whole blood. This analysis identified numerous genes whose expression was upregulated in the lung and in the blood throughout the time course of the infection. There was an upregulation in interferonstimulated genes and antiviral-related genes such as IRF7, IFIT2, OAS1, and OAS3. Our findings suggest that there are common signatures of influenza infection between the lung and whole blood, indicating that gene expression profiling of blood may eventually prove useful for diagnostic or prognostic applications. This subject is further discussed in the following section. We also worked with Richard Smith's group at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to perform the first ever global proteomic analyses on macaque lung samples. Side-by-side comparison of genomic and proteomic data from infected macaque lung samples revealed that there were many correlations between the two sets of data. Of particular interest, were the correlations observed for interferon-stimulated genes and antiviral-related genes. Members of these families, such as IFIT1, IFIT2, STAT1, and MX1, were identified by both genomics and proteomics. In further support for the use of whole blood as a surrogate marker of influenza pathogenesis in the lungs, gene expression data for the above markers and others correlated with the lung genomics and proteomics data (Baas et al., 2006a) . We would like to further these studies by determining if similar proteomic results are observed in whole blood. From these analyses, we also identified an increase in the abundance of certain proteins in influenza-infected lung that would not have been predicted by our genomics data. This observation points to the need for the integration of genomics and proteomics data to gain a more complete understanding of influenza pathogenesis. Furthermore, integration of genomic and proteomic data will enhance our understanding of the differences between mRNA levels and protein abundance. We have also recently used functional genomics and a macaque infection model to study the pathogenesis of the 1918 virus. For these studies, cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fasicularis) were infected with the human H1N1 virus, A/Kawasaki/173/01, or with the reconstructed 1918 virus (Kobasa et al., 2007) . Microarray analysis on bronchi from infected animals revealed a robust activation of numerous pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine genes in both A/Kawasaki/173/01 and 1918-infected animals at day 3 postinfection. Additionally, there was an increased activation of genes related to the interferon-a response in response to infection with either of these viruses at this time-point. Strikingly, many of the genes related to these responses exhibited a more robust upregulation in the A/Kawasaki/173/01-infected animals at day 3 postinfection, but returned to baseline levels or were downregulated later in infection compared with r1918-infected animals. In contrast, animals infected with the r1918 virus exhibited an increased and robust upregulation of expression of interferon-stimulated genes and chemokines and cytokines through the study endpoint. In support of our genomics observations, CCL2, CCL5, IL-8, and IL-6 levels were increased in the serum of r1918-infected macaques compared with the levels present in A/Kawasaki/173/01-infected animals at days 3 and 6 postinfection. Viral titers were substantially greater in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of macaques infected with r1918 at all three time-points postinfection. r1918-infected animals also exhibited severe lung pathology at 8 days postinfection (Kobasa et al., 2007) . Taken together, these data agree with data obtained using mouse models, suggesting that the pathogenesis induced by infection with the 1918 virus is associated with, and potentially caused by, an aberrant and unchecked immune response to the virus. As a consequence, this response turns from one that is beneficial to the host to one that is extremely detrimental. The studies described above demonstrate how nonhuman primate models can be used in combination with functional genomics to understand influenza-host interactions. Our studies, in conjunction with those of others, firmly demonstrate that nonhuman primate models of influenza provide crucial information into disease progression and pathogenesis. Currently, we are focused on using functional genomics to assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in nonhuman primates (Baskin et al., submitted) . These studies illustrate a novel use for functional genomics in influenza vaccine development. Genomic analyses during vaccine trials may reveal gene expression markers of protective immunity or gene expression changes that are indicative of a predisposition to a particular response to immunization and subsequent challenge. As mentioned previously, a major promise of genomics is the capacity to use this technology in the more precise and efficient diagnosis of disease. Of major interest, is the use of functional genomics to ascertain molecular signatures of infection that permit the distinction among diseases. Discussed below is how this technology is being tested for influenza diagnosis. To identify the gene expression signatures induced by various pathogens, Chaussabel et al. examined peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from pediatric patients presenting with various illnesses (2005) . Specifically, they examined diseases with distinct immunological components such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), influenza A, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. They also examined adult patients who received liver transplants with immunosuppressive therapy or patients who received bone marrow transplants and experienced graft versus host disease. These samples were compared with PBMCS from healthy volunteers. The authors were able to identify unique gene expression patterns for patients presenting with influenza and SLE. They then determined expression profiles common to all of the diseases using genes that were either up-or downregulated in patients infected with influenza or SLE. Analyses also demonstrated that the genes whose expression was regulated in a similar manner in both influenza and SLE patients fell into distinct categories such as defense response, interferon induction, and heavy metal binding. Furthermore, the authors were able to determine how many genes related to these processes were expressed in individual patients (Chaussabel et al., 2005) . In an extension of the above studies, the authors examined the gene expression profiles of PBMCs from young patients presenting with acute infections including influenza A, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and E. coli (Ramilo et al., 2007) . Analysis of these samples was performed in a methodical manner using statistical comparison, sample classification, validation of classifier genes using a test set, and validation of microarray platforms and chips. The authors were able to identify subsets of genes that distinguished patients with influenza (viral infection) from those that presented with either E. coli or S. pneumoniae (Gram-negative and Grampositive bacterial infections, respectively). The same was found for patients infected with influenza compared to those infected with S. aureus (Gram-positive bacterial infection). Distinct expression patterns were also present in PBMCs from patients infected with E. coli or S. aureus. Using sets of classifier genes obtained from the above analyses, the authors examined the gene expression profiles of PBMCs isolated from patients presenting with lower respiratory infections the same as those listed above or from healthy volunteers. From these analyses, the authors were able to classify the samples from these new patients into the correct disease categories. In addition, the authors tested a separate set of samples using a different array platform. These studies also demonstrated that patients presenting with these illnesses could be accurately classified into distinct groups based on gene expression profiles (Ramilo et al., 2007) . Through these painstaking efforts, the authors convincingly used functional genomics to discriminate between patients with a variety of acute infections, including influenza. While these studies provide evidence that genomics can be used to define molecular signatures of disease associated with certain pathogens, they also have significant limitations. For example, these studies were performed on samples that had been taken from patients that had already been diagnosed with a particular illness and genomic analyses only had to distinguish between a relatively few possibilities. However, in order to be effective in a clinical setting, gene expression profiling will need to provide a high degree of accuracy and overcome numerous confounding factors such as age, race, gender, immune status, and co-infection with more than one pathogen. All of these issues must be addressed before functional genomics can function in disease diagnosis. However, once these challenges have been met, genomic diagnosis may decrease the amount of elapsed time between sample collection and disease diagnosis thereby allowing doctors to treat patients more quickly. This is particularly important for patients presenting with acute infections. Additionally, the use of microarrays in this manner may eliminate the need for patients to undergo certain painful and potentially dangerous diagnostic procedures, such as tissue biopsies.@story_separate@Functional genomics has clearly provided critical information regarding virus-host interactions and has made significant contributions to influenza research. As we have described, functional genomics has been utilized to study influenza infection in a variety of model systems including cell culture, mice, and macaques. Researchers are also utilizing functional genomics to study influenza infections in chickens, but these endeavors are still in their infancy (Degen et al., 2006) . It will also be desirable to use functional genomics to examine influenza infection in ferrets. Unlike mice, ferrets can be productively infected with human influenza viruses and ferret-to-ferret transmission occurs. Due to these characteristics, ferrets provide a useful and unique model for influenza infection studies. Unfortunately, genomic studies using ferrets are currently limited due to the lack of ferret nucleotide sequence information. We therefore strongly recommend that the ferret genome be sequenced and that ferret-specific microarrays be developed. From the functional genomics experiments published so far, we have been able to gain invaluable insight into influenza pathogenesis. Perhaps the most critical use of this technology has been in the study of the virus responsible for the deadly 1918 influenza pandemic. In regards to highly pathogenic influenza, future experiments should also focus on the effect of avian H5N1 infection on global gene expression, using multiple model systems such as those that are being used to study the 1918 virus. Functional genomics has provided us with numerous insights into influenza-host interactions. In particular, we have utilized this technology to discern how low and high pathogenicity viruses affect host responses. However, there are many challenges facing our laboratory and others that use functional genomics. Of utmost concern, is the integration of the vast amounts of genomics data that is available and has yet to be generated. Among the major obstacles are microarray platform differences, species differences, cell type differences, and annotation differences (Wallace et al., 2006) . Data from microarray studies also needs to be integrated with conventional biological approaches and with data that will be obtained from the burgeoning field of proteomics. As demonstrated throughout this manuscript, our laboratory has worked tirelessly to achieve these goals. We firmly believe that functional genomics will be crucial to the development of novel therapies necessary for the prevention of influenza infection and spread.","Infection with influenza typically results in mild‐to‐moderate illness in healthy individuals; however, it is responsible for 30,000–40,000 deaths each year in the United States. In extreme cases, such as the influenza pandemic of 1918, tens of millions of people have died from the infection. To prepare for future influenza outbreaks, it is necessary to understand how the virus interacts with the host and to determine what makes certain strains of influenza highly pathogenic. Functional genomics provides a unique approach to this effort by allowing researchers to examine the effect of influenza infection on global host mRNA levels. Researchers are making increasing use of this approach to study virus–host interactions using a variety of model systems. For example, data obtained using microarray technology, in combination with mouse and macaque infection models, is providing exciting new insights into the pathogenicity of the 1918 virus. These studies suggest that the lethality associated with this virus is in part due to an aberrant and unchecked immune response. Progress is also being made toward using functional genomics in the diagnosis and prognosis of acute lung infections and in the development of more effective influenza vaccines and antivirals."
"It is widely known that endohedral fullerenes can provide novel ball-shaped molecules with exceptional structures and physical properties, which are unobserved for their empty analogs. Therefore, the encapsulation of different atoms or molecules, such as water, [1] metal atoms, [2] or trimetallic nitride clusters [3] within the fullerene cavity has attracted wide interest from researchers worldwide. In this regard, the development of synthetic protocols has allowed to synthesizing several endohedral fullerenes, which have shown a practical application either in biomedicine [4, 5] or materials science. [6, 7] A groundbreaking synthetic methodology coined the ''molecular surgery'' approach [8] was developed by Komatsu, Murata and co-workers in 2003. [9] This new approach resulted in the synthesis on an open-cage derivative with 100 % incorporation of H 2 molecule into the fullerene cage. In this sense, different chemical methods have been reported to convert open-cage fullerenes into endohedric derivatives and to produce H 2 @C 60 in milligram amounts. [10] A most recent high-yielding synthetic methodology to obtain H 2 @C 60 was described by Whitby et al., [11] and these results have paved the way for the advancement in fundamental as well as applied studies on this singular molecule. As yet, H 2 @C 60 is among the most studied small-molecule endofullerene. [12] Most of the research reported focused on the study of its physical properties. In this way, techniques such as IR, [13] NMR, [14] and photoionization [15] have been used to explain the interactions between the molecular hydrogen and the carbon cage surface. Moreover, theoretical calculations have allowed the prediction of some parameters that have led to a better understanding of hydrogen-filled endohedral fullerene complexes. [16] The cycloaddition reactions of H 2 @C 60 to yield methanofullerene and fulleropyrrolidine adducts have been reported to investigate potential changes on the reactivity of the outer fullerene cage due to the encapsulated hydrogen. [17] Besides, a small library of H 2 @C 60 derivatives covalently linked to a nitroxide radical have been prepared using either Prato or Bingel-Hirsh methodologies. [18, 19] Moreover, similar derivatives, in which a nitroxide radical is connected to the endofullerene by a folded 3 10 -helical peptide, [20] and also bisadduct isomers of a H 2 @C 60 derivative modified with nitroxide appendages have also been reported. [21] In addition, the stereoselective synthesis of H 2 @C 60 , was first described by Martín and co-workers, reacting chiral ligands and metal salts through a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of azomethine ylides. [22] Thus, an interesting finding regarding the encapsulation of a hydrogen molecule is that the process itself does not affect the reactivity or the stereoselectivity, as the observed results are similar to those of the hollow fullerene C 60 . [23] Interestingly, studies carried out by Turro et al. revealed that, actually, a crucial electron and vibrational interaction of incarcerated H 2 in endofullerene H 2 @C 60 with an external electronically excited molecule like singlet oxygen occurs. [24] Therefore, endohedral fullerenes could be used as probes for further experimental studies and, in this regard, much works remains to be done to developed new H 2 @C 60 derivatives. In particular, there is still much research to be done to develop novel synthetic procedures to generate H 2 @C 60 derivatives suitable for biological investigations. In this sense, during the last decade our research groups have carried out considerable experimental and theoretical work on novel steroid-fullerene hybrids for fundamental studies and their potential applications in diverse fields like medicinal chemistry and materials science. [25] To the best of our knowledge, there are not reports where the H 2 @C 60 is conjugated with a steroid moiety. Hence, herein, we describe the synthetic methodology to access a new conjugate where the endohedral fullerene, H 2 @C 60 , is covalently attached to the dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a naturally occurring steroid, which presents interesting bioactive properties. [26] To achieve this goal, the Bingel-Hirsh methodology was used. [27] This synthetic procedure constitutes one of the most widely applied reactions in fullerene's chemistry, due to its good selectivity and feasibility of adding a wide range of addends and functional groups. The chemical structure of the as-synthesized steroid-H 2 @C 60 was unambiguously corroborated by NMR (1D and 2D), IR, and mass spectrometry. Furthermore, theoretical calculations were achieved to envision the most stable conformation for the prepared compound, as well as to evaluate other relevant physico-chemical characteristics such as polarity, polarizability, and lipophilicity. Finally, a molecular docking simulation was carried out to predict the use of the synthesized steroid-H 2 @C 60 as potential inhibitor of SARS-Cov-2, proteases 3CL pro [28] and PL pro , [29] two of the enzymes that play crucial roles in the viral life cycle of the 2019 novel coronavirus or ""2019-nCoV"", [30] and constitute important targets for antiviral drug design.@story_separate@The novel steroid-endohedral fullerene hybrid 3 was synthesized through the cycloaddition reaction between the previously reported 3β-ethyl malonate-5-androsten-17-one (1) [31] and H 2 @C 60 , using a Bingel-Hirsch methodology, as depicted in Scheme 1. The cyclopropanation reaction was carried out at room temperature by mixing the H 2 @ [60] fullerene with 1, CBr 4 and DBU (see Scheme 1). Right after the DBU addition a change in the color of the solution from purple to brown was observed, which is a similar color change to that observed when the reaction is performed using the pristine C 60 . [31] In this regard, according to our previous studies a change in the coloration of the solution constitutes an evidence of chemical transformation onto the [60] fullerene molecule, which leads to a [6,6]-closed mono-adduct. The reaction was followed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), proceeding apace, since after 3 h it was completed. Then, the synthesized conjugate 3 was purified by flash chromatography, being firstly eluted the unreacted H 2 @C 60 using CS 2 , followed by the elution of the mono-adduct 3, with DCM as solvent. The endohedral hybrid was separated as a stable brown solid with a 76 % yield. The reaction mixture was investigated by HPLC, observing in the chromatogram (toluene: acetonitrile, 9 : 1, 1 mL min À 1 ) a peak at 5.5 min, assigned to hybrid molecule 3 (see Figure S10 in the Supporting Information), and a peak at 8.9 min corresponding to the unreacted H 2 @C 60 . It should be noticed that the reaction rate and the obtained yield are near to the same values disclosed for the functionalization of the hollow [60] fullerene with steroids. , [25a,25e,31] Thus, the H 2 molecule trapped inside the fullerene cavity does not influences the fullerene's cage reactivity as it was previously established. [22] The structural elucidation of the as-synthesized steroidendohedral fullerene 3 was accomplished using different spectroscopic techniques (see Experimental Section and Supporting Information). In this respect, FTIR spectrum exhibited the specific band of organofullerene derivatives at ca. 730 cm À 1 , [32] and a signal at 1720 cm À 1 corresponding to the C=O stretching vibration (see Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). NMR spectroscopy was used to substantiate the covalent link of the malonate-steroid to the H 2 @C 60 sphere. Thus, in the 1 H NMR spectra, the methylene protons of the malonate-steroid precursor at δ = 3.33 ppm were not observed, and two signals at 1.51 ppm and 4.58 ppm, were assigned to the protons of the ethoxycarbonyl group. Moreover, the presence of a doublet at δ = 5.52 ppm assigned to the proton H6 of the ring B and the proton on C3 positioned at ring A, at δ = 5.03 ppm, indicate the existence of the steroid fragment in the conjugate. Furthermore, due to the H 2 @C 60 cage, these signals are deshielded related to their positions in the precursor 1, at 5.34 ppm and 4.59 ppm, respectively. [31] Therefore, these signals confirmed the proposed structure of the steroid-endohedral hybrid 3. In addition, in the 1 H NMR spectrum is particularly remarkable the presence of a singlet at δ = À 3.13 ppm that corresponds to the encapsulated hydrogen molecule. Interestingly, this signal appears at a higher field than the value reported for H 2 @C 60 (δ = À 1.45 ppm). [19] In order to find the reasons behind this change in the chemical shift, we theoretically estimated the chemical shifts for compounds 3, a H 2 @C 60 -cyclopropane, and H 2 @C 60 (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information for details). The results showed that the saturation of a double bond is the main factor causing the upfield shielding of the H 2 located inside the fullerene cage, since the calculated upfield shift of the molecular hydrogen from H 2 @C 60 to H 2 @C 60 -cyclopropane is 2.77 ppm, only 0.83 less than for compound 3. These results are in agreement with the chemical shift change sensitivity reported for different derivatives of H 2 @C 60 , and in particular with the value of À 3.27 ppm reported for the Bingel-Hirsch cycloadduct formed by H 2 @C 60 and diethylmalonate. [10b] Additionally, the hydrogen molecule is slightly off-center displaced in 3 when compared to H 2 @C 60 , but this might only marginally impact the magnetic environment of the hydrogen ( Figure S12 ). 13 C NMR confirmed the formation of a monoadduct in the reaction of H 2 @C 60 with 1. In this regard, due to the lack of symmetry of the endohedral derivative 3 an increment in the number of signals between 145.4-139.4 ppm was observed. Moreover, two signals at 163.8 and 163.1 ppm were assigned to the two carbonyl groups present in the malonate fragment, which helped to corroborate the proposed structure of hybrid 3. In addition, the presence of the steroid motif was confirmed by a signal at low field (221.2 ppm) assigned to the C=O located at the C17 of the steroid backbone. Besides, the signals corresponding to C5, C6, and C3 of the steroid motif at 139.2, 122.9, and 77.4 ppm, respectively, were also detected, being the latter signal strongly deshielded by ca. 2 ppm, compared to the same signal in compound 1, due to the presence of the carbon sphere. Furthermore, the other signals of the steroid scaffold were not affected by the presence of the H 2 @C 60 cage (see Experimental Section). Finally, the signals associated with the sp 3 carbon atoms of the cyclopropane ring at the 6,6-ring juncture of the H 2 @C 60 structure were detected at δ = 72.7 and 71.8 ppm. The signals of quaternary carbon atoms appeared at 52.5 ppm. HSQC spectra have allowed straightforwardly the assignment of the 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR. In this sense, the analysis was based on the chemical shift's theory, substituent effects, and DEPT data. The assignment of quaternary carbon atoms was carried out through the analysis of the HMBC spectra. Furthermore, it is worth noting that 3 showed similar trends in the chemical shifts of the molecular backbone to those of 1, which constitute an evidence of the proposed chemical structure for the novel steroid-endohedral fullerene (see Experimental Section and Supporting Information) The proposed structure was verified by Mass Spectrometry. Consequently, the MALDI-TOF spectra of compound 3 showed a peak at m/z: 1122.2399 (calculated for C 84 H 34 O 5 : 1122.2406) corresponding to M + ion (See Figure S9 ). Furthermore, Figure S11 in the Supporting Information shows the UV-vis spectra of 3, which exhibit the classical profile of fullerene derivatives, showing a band centered at 430 nm as a representative identification for [6,6]-closed fullerene monoadducts. [33] A finding of paramount importance for future biological applications relies on the increment of solubility in organic solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, dimethylsulfoxide, and dimethylformamide, underwent by the hybrid 3 when compared with the parent H 2 @C 60 . This enhancement is directly related to the presence of polar groups on the steroid motif. The geometrical and electronic properties of the assynthesized hybrid 3 have been calculated. In this sense, we developed a theoretical study using density functional theory (DFT). In a first place, the molecule was pre-optimized with PM6-D3H4 semiempirical method as a useful starting point for further calculations. [34] For DFT calculations, the PBE functional was used as it showed good results in carbon systems as fullerenes, [35] and in endohedral fullerene systems, [36, 37] together with a reasonable computational cost, especially for the frequency calculations needed to assure getting the minimum energy conformations. Furthermore, it should be considered that in the endohedral system with nonpolar molecules as H 2 the London dispersion forces became very important to take into account. [38] Therefore, the third version of dispersion correction, together with Becke-Johnson damping (D3BJ) was applied. [39] The first structure optimization was carried out with 6-31G(d) basis set and then after triple zeta 6-311G(d,p) was used to reassure good quality results. The minimum energy conformation of compound 3 is depicted in Figure 1 . The total energies calculated using PM6 and DFT (Table S7 ) along with the Cartesian atom coordinates (Tables S2-S6 ) are given in the Supporting Information. Moreover, the overlap structures which were optimized by PM6-D3H4 and DFT PBE-D3BJ 6-311G(d,p) are shown in Figure S13 . The calculations have predicted the cyclohexane ring A of the steroid moiety to present a chair conformation. Furthermore, the carbonyl groups in the malonate moiety in the DFT-D3 optimized structure present an antiperiplanar disposition with a dihedral O=C···C=O angle of À 161.2°. This atoms disposition does not permit the formation of a hydrogen bond ChemPlusChem Full Papers doi.org/10.1002/cplu. 202000770  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57 between H3 and the oxygen from the closest carbonyl group. However, H3 forms hydrogen bond with the other carbonyl with a C=O···H distance of 2.51 Å. In addition, this carbonyl group participates in another interaction with the methylene hydrogen atom (2.59 Å). Interestingly, ring C presents a twisted boat conformation that can be the result of the hydrogen bond formed between the carbonyl from the cyclopentanone ring and the β-hydrogen join to the C12 on C ring of the steroid backbone (2.401 Å) (Figure 1 ). Regarding the disposition of the inner hydrogen molecule, Korona et al. [40] performed the analysis of the disposition of H 2 in a different not fully optimized structure of conformers of H 2 @C 60 . The conformation is energetically favored when the hydrogen molecule is perpendicular to one of the hexagonal rings. In the case of the hybrid steroid-H 2 @C 60 , the optimized structure does not present orientation in a clear perpendicular position of hydrogen molecule to any of the hexagonal rings ( Figure S14 in the Supporting Information). Similar results were found by Cross [41] who studied the rotational movement of the encapsulated H 2 and reported a free motion of the H 2 molecule inside C 60 . In addition, a Non-Covalent Interactions (NCI) analysis was performed, following the approach proposed by Johnson et al. [42] using the NCIPLOT program. [43] These results confirmed the presence of hydrogen bonding (Figure 2 , greenish color) between the oxygen atom located at C17 of the ring D and H12 (Figure 2c ), those formed among the oxygen atoms of the malonate moiety with H3 (Figure 2b) , and one of the hydrogens of the methylene group (upper left part of Figure 2a ). On the other hand, DFT combined with symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) calculation of endohedral H 2 @C 60 by Korona et al. [40] showed there is a weak stabilization interaction of the complex between the fullerene carbon cage and the H 2 guest molecule with a value of À 19.35 kJ/mol. The stabilization energy calculated by the supermolecule approach for H 2 @C 60 was carried out by Ramachandran et al. [44] at MP2/6-31G level of theory using the following equation ΔE stab = E complex À (E cage + E guest ) gives À 2.1 kcal/mol. Using the same approach at DFT-D3(BJ)/PBE/6-311G(d,p) level, the stabilization energy for compound 3 was found to be À 6.43 kcal/mol. Additionally, the NCI analysis confirmed the presence of hydrogen bonding (bluish color) between the oxygen atom located at C17 of the ring D and H12 (Figure 2c ) those formed among the oxygen atoms of the malonate moiety with H3 and one of the hydrogens of the methylene of the ethyl group (Figure 2b) . Additionally, the LUMO-HOMO energy values predicted by DFT calculation at PBE-D3JP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory are À 4.081 eV/À 5.414 eV. A band gap of 1.332 eV has been predicted. This value is quite similar to experimental values determined in analogous compounds. [25f,31] (See Figure S15 in the Supporting Information). In addition, to predict the intramolecular and intermolecular electrostatic interactions in hybrid 3, the molecular electrostatic potential map and selected descriptors and properties were calculated. Also, the same parameters were calculated for the pristine endohedral H 2 @C 60 . The electrostatic potential maps of 3 and H 2 @C 60 are depicted in Figure 3 . From its analysis, it is possible to conclude that the malonate-steroid core, covalently connected to the H 2 @C 60 cage, modifies the electrostatic potential distribution providing three well-defined regions. In this sense, the red zone was correlated with the oxygen atoms present in the carbonyl groups and denoted a negative density site. The regions with blue color indicate the positive areas located in some part of the steroid skeleton. Furthermore, a significant part of the molecular hybrid showed neutral green regions predicting no charge separation, indicating the lipophilicity of the molecule. On the other hand, a comparison with the electrostatic potential map of the corresponding derivative without the H 2 molecule inside the fullerene cage, previously reported by our research groups, [31] allowed to conclude that the H 2 molecule present in the endohedral derivative, does not influence the Additional properties were calculated for 3, and compared with those related to H 2 @C 60 ( Table 1 ). All results are consistent with the structural analysis of both compounds. The solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) is a geometric measure of the extent to which a molecule interacts with its environment. The transformation of H 2 @C 60 to hybrid steroid-H 2 @C 60 (3) leads to an increase in this parameter, which can be interpreted as a higher probability of interaction of 3 with targets of interest. The variation of SASA has also been used as an indirect confirmation of the capacity of C 60 as a K + channel blocker. [49] Related to the topological polar surface area (TPSA), which is a descriptor defined as the sum of surfaces of polar atoms in a molecule, Palm et al. [50] found a correlation between TPSA value and its ability to penetrate biological membranes, demonstrating that those molecules with a TPSA lower than 60 Å 2 are easily absorbed, and molecules with TPSA values greater than 140 Å 2 could have a low capacity for penetrating cell membranes It may account for their ready penetration capability in hydrophilic environments. As expected, the calculated TPSA was 0 for H 2 @C 60 , while for the hybrid steroid-H 2 @C 60 (3) was 69.67 Å 2 a value very close to set threshold of 60 Å 2 . These results are consistent with the covalent linking to the H 2 @C 60 structures of the malonate-steroid moiety, conferring some polarity to the surface of molecular hybrid 3 in comparison with the highly hydrophobic H 2 @C 60 . Therefore, 3 may act as potential biological membrane spanners. As expected for a structure only formed by carbon atoms, [60] fullerene has been considered to be hyperhydrophobic. [51, 52] The partition coefficient (P) is a physicochemical parameter, which allows determining the lipophilicity degree of 3 and H 2 @C 60 molecules. Thus, P could be defined as a quantitative parameter that represents the relative solubility of a given substance in a system composed of two phases that are immiscible with each other, at a specific temperature. The logP ow obtained through theoretical calculations showed that both compounds have high lipophilicity, but a lower value for 3 (11.96) in comparison with H 2 @C 60 (17.75) indicative of a lower hydrophobicity, which is consistent with the presence of the malonate-steroid moiety. These values might indicate that this kind of molecules would have the tendency to form aggregates in aqueous media, similar to the behavior reported for C 60 and their derivatives. [53] [54] [55] On the other hand, although H 2 @C 60 -steroid conjugation produced a weak charge separation as observed in Figure 3a , for compound 3 a calculated dipole moment of 5.45 D was predicted. Thus, in comparison with pristine 2 (Figure 3b ), a notably enlarged polarizability was observed (811.95 Å 3 vs. 511.79 Å 3 ). In this respect, polarizability displays a key role in determining induction and dispersion forces in molecules. Besides, atomic polarizabilities are widely used both in qualitative schemes for rationalizing molecular interactions as well as in quantitative techniques for modelling purposes. On the other hand, and according to the quenched polarizability model, [56] the polarizability of C 60 does not change significantly by the encapsulation of atoms or small molecules. Overall, the structural modification incorporated in the endohedral derivative 3 corresponds to a higher value of polarizability, in comparison with H 2 @C 60 . All these results reinforce the idea that electronic interactions must be considered to develop studies on chemical-biological interactions. The applications of the novel steroid-endohedral fullerene hybrid were also evaluated in medicinal chemistry, in particular, was explored its potential as antiviral at a theoretical level. Molecular docking of the steroid-H 2 @C 60 (3) was performed. The molecular targets studied here were the papain-like protease (PL pro ) [PDB ID: 4OVZ with 2.50 Å resolution, chain A] [57] and the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ) [PDB ID: 6LU7 with 2.02 Å resolution) chain A)] [58] of SARS-Cov-2. These are cysteine proteases that play crucial roles in the viral life cycle and are key targets for antiviral drug design. [59] The calculated negative binding energy [60] predicted that compound 3 has affinity for both enzymes. The binding energy values for the protease-hybrid complexes were À 9.9 kcal/mol and À 13.5 kcal/mol for PL pro and 3CL pro respectively, showing [a] Total volume calculated in Chimera 1.14 using MSMS library for surface generation.

The hybrid 3 blocked the active site area of both proteases through hydrophobic interactions and Hbonding of the fullerene core and the androsterone moiety. The lowest binding energy obtained for the 3CL pro is due to the higher number of H-bonds and residues interacting in comparison with PL pro (See Figure 4 . SARS-Cov-2 proteases are essential enzymes in the process of coronavirus replication; hence, they have been a popular target for coronavirus inhibitors. From the generated docking model, the fullerene derivative 3 was bound in the active site of PL pro interacting with ASN-157, LYS-158, GLU-162, GLU-168, HIS-172, TYR-269, and GLN-270 ( Figure 5A ). The binding sites of 3 are consistent with those of the crystalized inhibitor used as control and some antiviral drug docked. [61] A hydrogen bonding was predicted between the phenolic hydrogen atom of TYR-269 and the malonate linker group. Moreover, the aromatic region of this residue interacts with the fullerene core through T-shape and π-π interactions. [62] It is have been determined that the 3CL pro is the key protein during virus replication; its principal function is to hydrolyze the polymerase expressed by the virus so the occlusion of the SARS-Cov-2 protease (3CL pro ) active site inhibits the hydrolysis of the viral polymerase. [63] The active site of 3CL pro is placed in the gap between the residues 8-101 and 102-184, [61] with HIS-41 and CYS-145 as catalytic residues. [64] The docking results  show that THR-25, HIS-41, THR-45, SER-46, MET-49, ASN-142  HIS-144, CYS145 , MET-165, and GLU-166 are the main interacting residues with compound 3 (See Figure 5B) . The carbonyl group of the malonate linker forms hydrogen bonds with ASN-142 and GLU-166. The hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions are consistent with those found in the crystalized inhibitor and the anti-asthmatic drug Montelukast. [61] The binding energy study and the interaction with the active residues indicate that 3 has a potential use in anti-viral therapies against Covid-19. On the other hand, a molecular docking simulation was also applied to the pristine H 2 @C 60 to find the binding affinity with the enzymes PL pro and 3CL pro previously studied. H 2 @C 60 only shows hydrophobic interactions with both receptors, and the calculated binding energies were À 10.0 kcal/ mol and À 10.2 kcal/mol for PL pro and 3CL pro respectively. The interlinkage with PL pro does not match with the reported for 3 because it interacts with HIS-74, THR-75, LEU-76, ASP-77, GLN-175, and HIS-176 residues. These amino acids are not key residues in the enzyme inhibition, and consequently the endohedral fullerene is not considered a potential inhibitor for PL pro . A different result was obtained for 3CL pro , because H 2 @C 60 interacts with the main residues of the enzyme-like compound 3 but with lower affinity energy, since it cannot forms strong interactions through hydrogen bonds. Figure 6 shows the lowenergy binding conformations of 3 and H 2 @C 60 bound to human SARS-Cov-2 enzymes. The binding energy study and the interaction with the active residues indicate that 3 has a higher potential use in antiviral therapies against Covid-19. The functionalization of H 2 @C 60 with a steroid moiety is a way to increase the biomolecular recognition areas and increase the strength of the union with the enzymatic receptors. These results must be verified by future in vitro and in vivo assays. Similar results were obtained with the previously reported empty steroid-C 60 [31] because the fundamental interactions between the ligand and the proteases residues occur between the groups present in the malonatesteroid moiety (see Supporting Information Tables S8 and S9 , Figures S16-S18). General: All reagents were of commercial quality and were used as supplied unless otherwise specified. Solvents were dried by standard procedures. All reactions were performed using an atmosphere of argon and oven-dried glassware. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography carried out on 0.25 mm silica gel plates (230-400 mesh). Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel (60 Å, 32-63 μm). 1 H NMR spectra were recorded at 700 MHz, and 13 C NMR at 175 MHz; the one-bond heteronuclear correlation (HMQC) and the long-range 1 H-13 C correlation (HMBC) spectra were obtained by use of the inv4gs and the inv4gslplrnd programs. HRMS were recorded under MALDI (dithranol as matrix) conditions in positive mode of detection. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Cosmosil Buckyprep preparative column, dimensions, 4.6 × 250 mm 2 ; flow rate 1.0 mL min À 1 , injection volume 15 μL, eluent toluene) was used to determine the purity of the compounds synthesized. The retention times (t R ) reported were determined at a wavelength of 320 nm. FTIR spectra were carried out using ATR of the solid compound. UV/Vis spectra were recorded in CHCl 3 . Computational methods: All molecules were built with Avogadro. [65] For the semi-empirical calculations MOPAC2016 [66] was used, and DFT calculation was performed with ORCA 4.2.1. [66] All structures were pre-calculated using the semi-empirical PM6 method with dispersion correction D3H4 as a satisfactory starting point for large carbon structure, especially fullerene derivatives. [34] Then structures were optimized using Density Functional Theory at gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [68] method using 6-31G(d) and refined with 6-311G(d,p) basis set as described somewhere else. [69] The Grimme in combination with the Becke-Johnson damping (D3BJ) [70] method for empirical dispersion corrections together with the contribution of three-body dispersion terms, was employed, as the long-range dispersion interactions in endohedral fullerene are very important to consider in both geometry optimizations. The coulomb part integration was solved using Resolution of Identity (RI) approximation (with def2/J auxiliary basis set as a keyword in ORCA). To avoid imaginary frequency modes (negative frequencies) together with numerical noise, the TightOpt with VeryThight convergence as keywords was employed. Improving the numerical precision as ORCA implantation permits. The Lebedev302 grid (Grid4) during the SCF iterations and Lebedev434 (Grid 5) as a final grid for the final energy evaluation after SCF convergence was set for integration precision. The frontier orbitals HOMO/LUMO were visualized directly from the optimized structure with DFT/PBE quantum mechanical calculation with 6-311G(d,p) basis set using IboView v29150427 [71] and this conformation was used for the calculation of dipole moment and visualization of the electrostatic potential map. The Log P was calculate using XLOGP2v3.2.0. [48] For molecular electrostatic map first the mep.py python script written by Marius Retegan [72] was used for cube file preparation and then was visualized using VMD 1.9.3. [73] NCI analysis was performed using NCIPLOT 4.0 [43] and the result visualized with VMD 1.9.3. For visualization of optimized structure, Mercury 2020.1 was used. [74] The DFT GIAO calculations were carried out on previously optimized structure at the TPSS level as this functional similar accuracy compares to hybrid functionals at much lower computational cost [75] together with NMR optimized triple ζ basis set namely pcSseg-2 [76] with CPCM continuum solvation model using chloroform. The provided chemical shift are referenced to tetramethylsilane optimized and calculated using the same methodology as studied compounds. [57] and (3CL pro ) [PDB ID: 6LU7 (R = 2.02 Å) chain A)] [58] were used as the model of SARS-Cov-2 proteins and downloaded from Protein Data Bank (PDB) (http://rcsb.org). The crystallized inhibitors were removed and used as control molecules. The proteins were processed by removing water, adding polar hydrogen atoms, and default rotatable bonds were retained. Ligands optimized structures were obtained with the DFT PBE method. [68] The Gasteiger model was used for the calculations of the partial charges of the ligands. The proteins and ligand structures were saved in PDBQT format with AutoDock Tools. [77] The center of the simulations were boxes of size ( [78] Docking parameters were set to default, except for exhaustiveness = 32 and num_modes = 2. Ten independent runs were performed in each case, and the two best-docked conformations of each run were analyzed, according to the affinity calculated with the scoring function. The total docked conformations were grouped based upon Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of the different bound poses. The RMSD difference between conformations of the same cluster was set to less than 2 Å. The binding free energy (kcal/mol) of every cluster was calculated as the mean binding free energy (MBFE) of all the conformations present in the same cluster. The cluster 3D structures of the representative binding mode for each complex with best-scoring pose were represented using PyMOL 2.1.0. [79] Synthesis and Characterization Synthesis of 3β-ethylmalonate-5-androsten-17-one (1): This compound was prepared by following the method previously reported by us. [31]  To a solution of H 2 @C 60 (30 mg, 0.041 mmol) in dry toluene (50 mL) was added 3β-ethyl malonate-5-androsten-17-one (1, 21 mg, 0.053 mmol), CBr 4 (18 mg, 0.053 mmol), and diazabicyclo[4.2.0]undec-7-ene (DBU; 0.1 mL, 0.67 mmol) in that order. The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 3 h under argon atmosphere. The color of the solution changed from purple to brown. Water was added, and the residue was extracted with toluene. The organic layer was dried over MgSO 4 , filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel, first with CS 2 to elute unreacted C 60 and finally with dichloromethane. With characterization purposes, additional purification of these com-pounds was carried out by repetitive precipitation and centrifugation using hexane, methanol, and diethyl ether as solvents. @story_separate@In summary, the synthesis of H 2 @61-(ethoxycarbonyl)-61-(3β-Ocarbetoxy-5-androsten-17-one)methano [60] fullerene (3) has been performed using the Bingel-Hirsch protocol with a good yield. The reaction path is similar to that when pristine C 60 is used. A comprehensive spectroscopic and analytical study confirmed the chemical structure of the new compound. Calculations have predicted that the cyclohexane ring A of the steroid moiety presents a chair conformation and the carbonyl groups in the malonate moiety shows an antiperiplanar disposition. Additionally, it was also possible to determine that in H 2 @C 60 , the hydrogen molecule does not present a clear perpendicular disposition to any of the hexagon rings of the fullerene cage. All theoretical physicochemical parameters were consistent with the structure of 3, and allow us to infer the behavior of the novel hybrid in the environment of the biological fluids and its potential to traverse biological membranes. A binding energy study with the active residues of human SARS-Cov-2 enzymes and the interactions found indicate that the steroid-H 2 @C 60 hybrid has potential for its implementation in further studies towards anti-viral therapies against SARS-Cov-2.","We report the synthesis and characterization of a fullerene‐steroid hybrid that contains H(2)@C(60) and a dehydroepiandrosterone moiety synthesized by a cyclopropanation reaction with 76 % yield. Theoretical calculations at the DFT‐D3(BJ)/PBE 6‐311G(d,p) level predict the most stable conformation and that the saturation of a double bond is the main factor causing the upfield shielding of the signal appearing at −3.13 ppm, which corresponds to the H(2) located inside the fullerene cage. Relevant stereoelectronic parameters were also investigated and reinforce the idea that electronic interactions must be considered to develop studies on chemical‐biological interactions. A molecular docking simulation predicted that the binding energy values for the protease‐hybrid complexes were −9.9 kcal/mol and −13.5 kcal/mol for PL(pro) and 3CL(pro) respectively, indicating the potential use of the synthesized steroid‐H(2)@C(60) as anti‐SARS‐Cov‐2 agent."
"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the agent of novel coronavirus 2019 , has kept the globe in disquiets due to its severe life-threatening conditions (Achar and Ghosh, 2020; Mahalaxmi et al., 2021) . This shattering disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Organization, 2020) . The first cases of COVID-19 were previously documented in December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China (Achar and Ghosh, 2020). After then, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to over two hundred countries and territories (Rose-Redwood et al., 2020). Furthermore, the WHO reported COVID-19 as a global pandemic disease (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020). As of September 4, 2020, approximately twenty-six million cases of had been discovered, leading to ∼860,000 deaths worldwide (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is well known as a human coronavirus; an enveloped, positive-sensed, ssRNA virus characterized by its crown-like shape (Ye et al., 2020) . Even coronavirus (CoV) species are known as human pathogens; the epidemic viruses SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV and those J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f continuously circulating in human populations since initial isolation: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63. All lead to human central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction . In infants and young children, the most common CNS phenomena are febrile seizures; in adults, non-focal abnormalities may be either neurologic or constitutional (Morgello, 2020; Ye et al., 2020). Symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild to severe symptoms. Mild symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion, nausea, and/or vomiting after two weeks of exposure to this virus (Ye et al., 2020). Severe signs from COVID-19 are in the form of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sepsis (Jindal et al., 2020) . It has been well-established that people who are more susceptible to severe illness include those aged people (SMN, 2020). However, individuals of all ages are at a higher risk for severe illness if they suffer from any medical diseases or suffer from any comorbidities such as chronic lung, kidney, or liver disease, moderate to severe asthma, severe heart conditions, diabetes, severe obesity, and conditions that cause immunodeficiency (Thomé et al., 2020). It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 invades human cells through interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Thomé et al., 2020) . This mechanism is detailed in the section ""Mechanism of Viral Invasion: ACE2 Receptor"". As COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease, high levels of ACE2 have been observed in pulmonary type II alveolar cells and respiratory epithelial cells. While, ACE2 expression is not limited to the respiratory tract but extended to other areas that as myocardial cells, ileal and esophageal epithelial cells, renal proximal tubule cells, and bladder urothelial cells Currently, exceptionally, mammalian coronaviruses are members of the alpha and beta genesis. The global distribution of coronavirus species is ""driven"" by bat populations, which constitute the major viral reservoir. In regions of the world where bats are highly diverse, as in portions of Asia and Africa, host switching is the dominant mechanism of viral evolution (Anthony et al., 2017) . Thus, zoonotic transmission to man a had higher likelihood in these geographic areas, like host switching is its predicate. There are currently 7 known human coronaviruses; almost all have zoonotic origins or are known to circulate in animals (Anthony et al., 2017). Animal surveillance had been suggested as a useful technique in combatting epidemic viruses as, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 could infect as well replicate in domestic cats, with transmission from infected to uninfected cats occurring through respiratory droplets (Anthony et al., 2017) . As these common J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pets may be in the community as well as in close contact with their owners at home, they may conceivably provide an adjunctive mechanism for virus tracking.@story_separate@SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic coronavirus that had led to ongoing worldwide pandemic disease (Sharma et al., 2020) . One of the earliest symptoms reported in covid is loss of smell. It was reported that the virus could access to the central nervous system through the bloodstream with subsequently leads to endothelial cell infection. Additionally, the virus can enter the peripheral nervous system through retrograde neuronal routes (Abdullahi et al., 2020) . This virus may internalize into the nerve terminals via endocytosis, transported retrogradely, and widely spread trans-synoptically to other brain areas (Iadecola et al., 2020) . Angiotensin-converting enzyme -2 receptor; was observed in the nasal mucosal lining; is attacked by the virus. The presence of these receptors in the tissues of the central nervous system is hypothesized to be the reason that the virus subsequently leads to neurological symptoms and signs (Moreno et al., 2004) . After the virus goes to the cerebral circulation, its protein S protein interacts with the capillary endothelium ACE-2 receptors. After then, the virus buds from the capillary endothelium leading to the widespread of the virus in multiple areas of the brain and brainstem through the Virchow-Robin spaces surrounding both the arterioles and venules (Iadecola et al., 2020) . Cytokine  It was decomented that the major clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are respiratory due to pulmonary complications. Symptoms can be mild, including fever, headache, cough, dyspnea, and myalgia; or severe, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which sometimes develops about 1 week into the illness and may result in death. CNS complications of COVID-19 infection have not been systematically investigated or analyzed (Khateb et al., 2020) . Additional neurological signs, documented in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 with ARDS include myalgia (Munhoz et al., 2020) , diffuse corticospinal tract signs with enhanced tendon reflexes and ankle clonus, and dysexecutive syndrome. Other signs, imaging findings included perfusion abnormalities in all the patients, leptomeningeal enhancement in most of them, and cerebral ischemia in about 23%. Meanwhile, these results should be interpreted cautiously, as they could represent, at least in part, different effects of the critical illness state, regardless of the SARS-CoV-2 etiology (Khateb et al., 2020) .@story_separate@This minireview highlights the possible routes by which SARS-CoV-2 can invade the central nervous system (CNS) and its pathophysiology and manifestation.

"Online Social Networks (OSNs) like Twitter or Facebook are virtual spaces that allow people to connect with like-minded others by exchanging different types of media content including posts, links, and pictures [45] . To a large extent, social interaction inside these platforms resembles communication aspects of everyday life. Particularly, the exchange of private information, either inside or outside OSNs, is fundamental for creating and maintaining social relationships [59] . Hence, it is not surprising that people often disclose personal information in social media platforms in order to strengthen their bonds and maximize their social capital [30] . Nevertheless, keeping private information away from untrusted recipients becomes a challenging task for average users since OSNs place the members of disjoint social circles (e.g., family and work colleagues) under a same communication channel [30, 57] . Consequently, this often leads to unintentional privacy breaches due to misalignments between the intended and the actual audience of online publications [50] . Access-Control Lists (ACLs) or just ""friend lists"" are one of the most salient privacy mechanisms of OSNs since they allow users to constrain the audience of the content they publish online [22, 44] . Basically, ACLs are collections of contacts that are deemed untrusted by the user regarding the access to certain pieces of personal information. In principle, ACLs are an effective way to keep the information disclosed inside posts away from unintended recipients. For example, an ACL composed of work colleagues could be applied to restrict the visibility of a post with a negative comment about one's employer. However, creating custom ACLs can introduce a high cognitive burden on average users since it demands assessing the trustworthiness of a large number of contacts [41, 1] . Furthermore, different ACLs must be created for different types of personal information since individuals' trustworthiness may vary from content to content [17] . Last but not least, keeping ACLs' internal consistency can demand a great effort given that users are likely to add or remove contacts from their network over time [40] . Access-Control Predictive Models (ACPMs) aim to reduce the burden of manual configurations through the automatic generation of custom ACLs [1] . Particularly, ACPMs leverage a set of classification features (e.g. personal attributes or network structure) to elaborate and recommend ACLs aligned with a set of access-control preferences provided by the user [27, 44] . One approach consists of applying community detection algorithms for identifying clusters of untrusted members inside the user's ego-network (i.e. the network of connections between her friends) [39, 27] . Under this approach, an ACL is created out of the members of the cluster that best fits the user's access-control preferences. In this case, preferences are specified through a set of contacts marked as ""untrusted"" by the user (Fig. 1) . Such a community-based ACPM is suitable particularly in cases where accessing the personal attributes of network members (e.g. age, gender, workplace) is limited or not possible at all [38, 39] . This is because traditional community-detection algorithms (such as Leading Eigenvector [43] or Multilevel Community [6] ) can identify clusters without requiring information on the attribute values of its nodes (if any).@story_separate@Although community-based ACPMs only require structural network information for their application, they can nonetheless lead to inaccurate ACL configurations. Particularly, this is due to the influence of homophily in the formation of communities inside a network as on people's accesscontrol preferences [55, 12, 19] . Basically, homophily refers to an organization principle in which the members of a network with similar characteristics tend to create connections with each other [35] . On the one hand, such a principle has a large impact on a network's structure and consequently in the formation of its communities [12] . Particularly, it is to expect that the members of an emerging cluster would hold a certain similarity with regard to a set of attribute values (e.g. location, gender or workplace) [28] . On the other hand, users' access-control preferences are also largely influenced by some of the attribute values shared among network members. For instance, in order to generate an ACL of work colleagues, a user would label as ""untrusted"" some of the contacts who share her same ""workplace"" attribute value. However, unlike the user's ACL preferences, traditional community-detection algorithms are not driven by attribute similarity causing flaws in the identification of untrusted communities [15, 39, 18] . In particular, they may select best-fit clusters whose members do not portray similarities on the attribute values deemed relevant for the generation of the corresponding ACL [15] . Consequently, such a community-based ACPM may generate inaccurate ACL configurations and privacy vulnerabilities under certain homophily scenarios. Another factor that can affect the efficacy of ACLs is information diffusion in OSNs. Particularly, OSNs are endowed with affordances that allow their users to re-share content from others making it available to an audience Figure 1 : Alice's ego-network. Untrusted friends John, Bill, and Bob are grouped under cluster 1 . An ACL containing all the nodes in 1 is generated and recommended to Alice [15] . beyond the one defined by the content owner [23] . This can result in privacy breaches especially when a trusted member makes the user's post available to an untrusted one after resharing it [23, 61] . Nevertheless, despite its importance in terms of privacy and access-control, the dynamics of information diffusion in OSNs are often neglected by ACPMs including community-based ones [2] . Consequently, privacy violations can occur even when ACLs manage to properly identify all the untrusted recipients of a particular piece of private information. This calls for the elaboration of more robust solutions that are not only capable of satisfying users' access-control preferences, but also manage to prevent the propagation of personal information throughout the untrusted segments of a network. This work elaborates on the findings reported in [15] further investigating the impact of homophily and information diffusion in community-based ACPMs. Particularly, the performance of this approach is evaluated against different network topologies and information diffusion settings. For this, two simulation experiments are outlined, executed, and interpreted. In the first one, topologies are generated according to particular homophily conditions describing the attachment probability between nodes of similar characteristics. These network configurations are used thereafter to determine the precision, recall, and F1 score of communitydetection algorithms when predicting ACLs. Unlike in [15] , Links in Context [21] , an attribute-based clustering approach, is also considered for performance evaluation along with traditional structure-based methods. In the second experiment, the dynamics of information diffusion (not considered in [15] ) is introduced in the generated networks to elaborate countermeasures against unwanted data dissemination. In this case, the removal of gatekeeper nodes (i.e. trusted members linked to untrusted clusters) is investigated through a model of social influence as an approach for reducing the amount of personal information spread across untrusted segments of a network. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, related work on access-control prediction and information diffusion in OSNs is discussed and analysed. Following, Section 3 introduces the theoretical foundations of this paper. In particular, homophily-driven preferential attachment and social influence models are presented and described for later application. Sections 4 and 5 describe the methodology and results of simulation experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Such results together with their limitations are further discussed in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7, we outline the conclusions of this paper and introduce directions for future work. Controlling the access to personal information is until now one of the main privacy challenges of OSNs. Particularly, such a challenge has motivated several contributions dealing with the automatic configuration and recommendation of ACLs. This section discusses related work elaborating on different ACPMs within the current literature. Likewise, advances on information diffusion and social influence are also analysed under the lens of access-control decisions. Privacy and security scholars have developed several approaches to facilitate the definition of access-control policies in OSNs. Particularly, ACPMs seek to automate the generation of ACLs through machine learning [44, 17, 37, 14, 52] , formal logic [48, 56] , and network analysis [18, 38, 15] among other methods. On a large scale, ACPMs can be classified into community-based [18, 38, 15] or attribute-based [44, 17, 14, 54] , depending on whether they leverage communities or personal attributes for the automatic generation of access-control policies. For instance, Díaz Ferreyra et al. [14] introduced an attribute-based solution in which decision trees are generated to recommend adequate post audiences in OSNs. Under this approach, friends are classified into trusted or untrusted by applying a number of conditional tests over a set of profile attributes such as age, gender, interest and education. A similar strategy is followed by Dong et al. [17] who elaborated on a classifier in which the sharing tendency between users together with the sensitivity of the content being disclosed are employed as audience predictors. Similar attributes along with demographic and location-related information were used by Ni et al. [44] in a machine learning solution that recommends personalized privacy policies for user-generated content in OSNs. Despite their levels of accuracy, attribute-based solutions display some limitations related to the information on which access-control predictions are made. Particularly, deciding which attributes should be deemed as predictors is not a trivial decision. Furthermore, some attributes may not be available across different OSNs, making it difficult to engineer multi-platform solutions [38] . Conversely, communitybased ACPMs do not suffer from these limitations and may be considered as less privacy invasive since their predictions are grounded on clustering algorithms that use solely the network structure as input. For example, Misra et al. [38] unveiled untrusted social circles in OSNs using the Clique Percolation Method, an approach which builds up communities out of fully-connected network sub-graphs. Certainly, hybrid solutions have also been introduced and discussed along with community and attribute-based ACPMs. Such is the case of Fangfang et al. [52] who elaborated a model for the automatic trust assessment of network members based on both, the connections and attribute similarities among them. Nevertheless, although hybrid solutions can show a high accuracy, their performance tends to decrease as the size of the network becomes larger [16] . Furthermore, a performance comparable to the one of hybrid ACPMs can be also achieved by community-based solutions within a shorter time frame [38, 18] . A large body of research has been dedicated to the study of diffusion processes in complex networks [13, 46, 31, 24, 2, 20] . Particularly, a significant number of works have explored approaches for the identification of the most influential users in a network with the aim of maximizing the spread of information [34] . For instance, Dhamal [13] elaborated on influence optimization through an adaptive seed strategy consisting of multiple phases of information diffusion. Under this method, influence maximization is achieved by selecting seed nodes at different stages according to the observed propagation of information over time. In line with this, Radion Purba et al. [46] introduced an information diffusion model that incorporates the engagement and activeness levels of Instagram users as indicators of their influence susceptibility and influence degree, respectively. Work concerning the identification of diffusion participants can also be found within the current literature. Such is the case of Li et al. [31] who developed a method for spotting members that are likely to forward viral information in Twitter. Particularly, they elaborated a ranking of potential hashtag adopters by analysing and forecasting the use of hashtags across multiple chains of followers. All in all, influence maximization research is of great value for many real-world applications including online marketing [62] , trending topic detection [36] , and information summarization [53] . Nevertheless, information diffusion has also been analysed from an influence minimization perspective and applied in areas such as public health policies [63] , misinformation [60] , and cybersecurity [24, 2, 20] . For instance, Jia et al. [24] proposed limiting the propagation of adversarial content through the deletion of critical nodes and edges in a network. Likewise, Yan et al. [60] employed an edge-removal strategy to counteract the diffusion of rumours across OSNs. Overall, these applications share the common goal of stopping the spread of an agent (viruses, information, etc.) across the members of a network. However, accesscontrol decisions in OSNs introduce the additional challenge of optimizing the utility of information disclosure. That is, maximizing the number of trusted recipients while reducing the number of untrusted ones. Prior work has introduced formal frameworks for analysing this problem and algorithms for approximating its solution (cf. [2, 20] ). Still, to the best of our knowledge, such a challenge has not been tackled from a community-detection perspective. Furthermore, it has not been analysed yet under the lens of homophily. As discussed in Section 2.2, ACPMs often neglect the role of information diffusion when generating custom privacy policies. Moreover, homophily can also affect the performance of community-based approaches since it has a direct impact in the formation of communities inside OSNs. This work aims to investigate these aspects through simulation models of information diffusion and attributed scalefree networks. Such models and their main characteristics are introduced and discussed in the following subsections. Large complex networks like the Internet or OSNs have caught the attention of researchers across different fields [3] . Empirical studies have shown that these networks share an important property: only a small number of nodes hold a big amount of connections to other nodes, whereas most nodes have just a few [4] . Networks containing such important nodes, or hubs, tend to be scale-free in the sense that the degree of these hubs (i.e. number of connections to other nodes) widely exceeds the average [25, 4] . Up to now, scholars have proposed several evolution models for constructing scale-free networks [26, 28, 10, 5] . Among those models, one of the most prominent ones is the one introduced by Barabasi and Albert [5] . This model indicates that two simple mechanisms, growth and preferential attachment, are responsible for the emergence of scale-free networks [4] . On the one hand, growth refers to the process in which at each time step a node with (≤ 0 ) links is added to the network and connected to pre-existing nodes. Preferential attachment, on the other hand, describes the process by which new nodes prefer to link to the more connected nodes in the network (i.e. the hubs) [4] . In principle, the preferential attachment mechanism proposed by Barabasi and Albert does not take attribute similarity into consideration. Nevertheless, this approach has been enriched with homophily characteristics by other researchers resulting in more specific network evolution models [26, 28, 15] . For example, Kim et al. [28] introduced a groupopenness mechanism for modelling the homophily and attachment probability between two nodes in a network. Under this approach, a node characterised with the attribute value is considered a member of the group . Then, the attachment probability between a node of group and a node of group is computed as a function of the openness factor Λ between the groups and . Such a factor can adopt values between 0 and 1 and indicates how closed (or open) is a node in group to create links with other nodes in [29] . Diaz Ferreyra et al. [15] adopted and extended this mechanism to situations in which nodes are characterized through multiple attribute values and therefore deemed members of more than one group. Particularly, homophily across different groups is expressed through an openness matrix composed by the openness factors of all pairs of attribute values available in the network (see Appendix A for a detailed description). The corresponding preferential attachment model is adopted in this work for the generation of network topologies aligned with specific homophily conditions. Many efforts have been made to understand and recreate information diffusion processes in OSNs [33, 7, 32] . To a wide extent, such efforts have their origins in studies seeking to simulate the dynamics of epidemic diseases in biological networks. Overall, this is because information (just like a virus) begins to spread from a set of seed nodes to the rest of the network at a certain diffusion rate [7, 32] . Different information diffusion models within the current literature have sought to recreate such a process making particular assumptions about its dynamics [7] . For example, progressive models like the Lineal Threshold (LT) [51] assume that, once infected, nodes cannot switch back to their original non-infected state. Conversely, non-progressive models like the Susceptible Infected Susceptible (SIS) [42] consider the scenario in which an infected node can return to its initial condition and therefore be infected many times. Particularly a progressive variation of this last one, the Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR), has been applied in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to simulate chains of contagion across communities [8] . Another approach widely applied to describe information diffusion processes in OSNs is the Independent Cascade (IC) [32, 51] . Let us consider an ego-network representation = ( , ) where the node set corresponds to the user's befriended contacts and to the connections existing between them. The IC is a non-progressive model in which information spreads from an initial set of infected nodes 0 ⊆ to the rest of the network members like a domino [7] . For the case of sharing a post in an OSN, 0 could be defined as a sub-group of friends who notice the user's post once published and are likely to re-share it. Hence, at each time step ≥ 0 an infected node ∈ can pass the information to an inactive (i.e. non-infected) neighbour ∶ ( , ) ∈ with probability . If successful, becomes infected at time step +1, otherwise stays inactive and has no chance to infect it again. However, if has more than one infected neighbour, it will be approached by each of them independently. Such a contagion process continues to unfold until there are no more infection attempts to be triggered. In Section 5.1, the IC model is adopted and instantiated to evaluate i) the effectiveness of the predicted ACLs under information diffusion conditions, and ii) elaborate countermeasures to prevent unwanted data dissemination in OSNs. All in all, homophily is a process that may impact a network's structure and consequently impair the outcome of community-based ACPMs. This experiment aims to analyse the effect of homophily when generating ACLs from the emerging communities inside ego-networks. For this, such a community-based approach was put into practice in simulated network topologies under different homophily conditions. The following subsections describe the methodology employed in the experiment and the results obtained from its execution. In this experiment, the simulation approach introduced in [15] is followed. As it is shown in Fig. 3 , a communitybased ACPM requires (i) the user's ego-network and (ii) her privacy preferences in order to generate a personalized ACL. Particularly, such preferences can be described through a small sample of untrusted friends. That is, some of those contacts who should be excluded from the audience of a certain piece of personal information. Therefore, this stage consists of a method for simulating ego-networks and a criterion for the selection of untrusted network members: • Simulation of ego-networks: As discussed in Section 3.1, networks are generated through a homophilydriven preferential attachment model in which nodes are characterized with the attributes gender, workplace, and location. Particularly, nodes in the generated networks can adopt the values or for the gender attribute, , , or for workplace, and , or as location. Under this model, the attachment probability between two nodes is computed through an openness matrix describing the homophily conditions of the network. Basically, the values inside can range from 0 to 1 and represent the strength of attribute similarity in the linking process (e.g. a value Λ closer to zero describes a setting in which users located in York are less likely to connect with users living in Leeds). An extended description of this mechanism can be found in the Appendix. • Selection of untrusted nodes: The selection of untrusted network members is guided by a hypothetical self-disclosure scenario in which a user working in (i.e. the ego of the simulated network) wishes to create an ACL to exclude her work colleagues from the audience of her publications. Hence, nodes with the attribute value = are selected from the generated ego-networks representing the user's access-control preferences. Particularly, nodes with the highest degree are selected as these are often the most influential ones in the network. The corresponding ACL is then built out of the community that brings together the largest amount of these untrusted nodes. For this, a community-detection algorithm (CDA) is employed to identify clusters of nodes inside the network under analysis. The goal of this simulation experiment is to evaluate the performance of community-based ACLs under different homophily conditions. For this, a set of network topologies were generated out of different values and used thereafter to produce the corresponding ACLs. Since is the attribute that drives the selection of untrusted nodes, three configurations were defined to simulate networks with a higher/lower degree of homophily: As it can be observed, these configurations differ only in the values assigned to Λ , Λ and Λ while the rest of the group-openness factors were set to one. These values were adopted from [15] as they lead to topologies with significant differences in structure and workplace homophily. The simulation model described in the previous subsection was implemented using iGraph [9] , a library for network analysis and visualization for R 1 . A total of three ego-networks of size = 500 were simulated each aligned with the homophily conditions 1 , 2 and 3 . In all cases, the attribute values of the nodes were assigned following the probability tree of Fig. 4 . Likewise, = 10 untrusted nodes were selected from each of the networks for the generation of the corresponding ACLs. Particularly, three different CDA were applied to unveil clusters inside the simulated networks: Leading Eigenvector (LE) [43] , Multilevel Community (MC) [6] , and Links in Context (LiC) [21] . Both LE and MC were initially assessed in a prior study (c.f. [15] ). These methods rely solely on structural information to split the nodes of the network into a hierarchy of nested communities. Conversely, LiC also leverage the network's attributes to identify densely-connected groups of nodes [21] . Basically, LiC defines the context of each link in the network as the subset of attributes that are common to its endpoints. Thereby, it identifies communities of nodes through agglomerations of links sharing the same context. To the best of our knowledge, LiC has not been yet evaluated for the automatic generation of ACLs. and Λ ), the nodes of the network tend to agglomerate around three big communities. Hence, the precision of the predicted ACLs (i.e. the percentage of untrusted nodes it contains) improves considerably from 1 to 2 and reaches its maximum in the homophily condition 3 (Table 1) . Particularly, the highest precision in 1 and 2 is achieved through the LE algorithm with a 48.98% and 75.00%, respectively. In the case of 3 the best precision score corresponds to the algorithm MC with a value of 99.29%. On the other hand, the method's recall (i.e. percentage of untrusted nodes in the network included in the generated ACL) also reaches its maximum value in 3 for all the clustering methods. In terms of execution time, MC and LE were able to identify clusters within seconds whereas LiC took more than 3 minutes in the best case ( 3 ) 2 . With respect to the number of generated clusters, LiC unveiled more communities than LE and MC in all configurations. Particularly, LiC identified the largest number of clusters in 2 (530 clusters) whereas the smaller amount corresponds to MC and LE in 3 (6 clusters each). As for the ACL size, the average number of clustered members was 124.67±127.61 in 1 , 53.33±13.50 in 2 , and 162.67 ± 18.82 for the homophily condition 3 . As discussed in Section 2.2, the re-sharing affordances of OSNs can impair the effectiveness of ACLs and violate, in turn, the privacy preferences of content-owners. This section introduces a simulation experiment for analysing the performance of community-based ACLs under different information diffusion settings. For this, the network topologies generated in Section 4 are infected using the IC model introduced in Section 3.2. Particularly, an ANOVA test is conducted to determine the effects of the network's homophily and the number of seed nodes on the percentage of infected nodes at the corresponding ACL. Furthermore, the effects of removing gatekeeper nodes are also evaluated and proposed as a means for counteracting unwanted data dissemination. Fig. 5 illustrates the main building blocks of the proposed simulation approach. First, a total of gatekeeper nodes of the highest degree are removed from the egonetwork under analysis. Such nodes are trusted members linked to one or more nodes inside the corresponding ACL and may therefore forward the information to untrusted network segments. Next, a group of seed nodes is selected from outside the ACL and infected according to the premises of the IC model. Basically, this step recreates the situation in which the user's post reaches members of the trusted audience that are likely to re-share it. In principle, the IC model assumes that all infected nodes in the network can pass the information to their non-infected neighbours with the same probability. However, to a certain extent, the dynamics of information diffusion are related to homophily characteristics of OSNs [11] . Particularly, the flow of usergenerated content across OSNs can be strongly influenced by attribute similarities among its users [47] . Therefore, the IC model was adjusted so that the probability with which an infected node spreads information to a non-infected neighbour is computed as: where # corresponds to the number of attributes characterizing the network (3 in this case) and # ℎ to the number of attribute values shared between and . The parameter represents the maximum infection probability among all network members and can adopt values ranging between 0 and 1. The effects of homophily along with the number of seed nodes and removed gatekeeper nodes were analysed in a 3x2x3 factorial experimental design. Particularly, = 0, 1 3 or 2 3 of the getaway nodes were removed from the networks corresponding to the homophily configurations 1 , 2 and 3 . In addition, these networks were infected with = 75 or 150 seed nodes as described in Section 5.1. In all cases, the parameter was set to 0.6 to represent a tendency of the network members towards information re-sharing. Likewise, all ACLs were generated using the LE algorithm since it was the one with the best overall precision in Simulation 1. The IC model was executed 100 times for each of the 3x2x3=18 experimental conditions resulting in 1800 simulation runs. An ANOVA test was conducted on the simulation results to determine the effects of i) homophily, ii) diffusion seeds, and iii) removed gatekeepers on the percentage of infected ACL members. At first, a Levene's test determined that the dataset resulting from the simulation outputs did not meet ANOVA's assumption of homogeneity of variance. However, this condition can be relaxed for large samples (N ≥ 30) and when the number of observations is equally distributed (or nearly so) across the different factors and levels [49] . Since these conditions are met by the generated data set (i.e. N=1800 and 100 observations per level), the ANOVA analysis was carried out accordingly. As summarized in Table 2 , all of the main factors were significant for the percentage of infected ACL members after the execution of the IC model ( > 0.001). Particularly homophily yielded an effect size of 2 = 0.080, indicating that around 8% of the variance in the percentage of infected ACL nodes was explained by this factor ( 2,1782 = 77.622, = 0.000). Such a variance is affected in 3.9% by the diffusion seeds ( 1,1782 = 72.731, = 0.000) and in 77.8% by the removed gatekeepers ( 2,1782 = 3123.266, = 0.000). A significant interaction effect of 0.008 was observed between homophily and diffusion seeds ( 2,1782 = 7.111, = 0.001). Likewise, a significant effect of 0.184 was yielded from the interaction between homophily and removed gatekeepers ( 4,1782 = 100.131, = 0.000). However, no significant effects were observed from the interaction of all three factors altogether ( 4,1782 = 2.014, = 0.090). In order to further examine the significant main effects, a Tukey HSD Post-Hoc test was conducted (Table 3) . Particularly, an average drop of 30.95% in the infected ACL nodes was observed after removing 1 3 of the gatekeeper nodes and 47.05% after removing 2 3 ( < 0.001). Likewise, the average difference of -16.10% between the 2 3 and 1 3 gatekeeper removal conditions was also found significant ( < 0.001). On the other hand, the percentage of infected ACL members increases 6% on average from homophily condition 1 to 2 and decreases about 6.96% from 2 to 3 ( < 0.001). However, no significant differences were observed between homophily conditions 3 and 1 . Several remarks can be drawn upon the results obtained from the simulation experiments. On the one hand, the performance of community-based ACPMs is closely related to the homophily of the network under analysis and the attribute values that are critical for the ACL configuration. This can be observed from the results of Simulation 1 where the precision of the predicted ACL becomes higher as the homophily in workplace increases. Particularly, LE resulted the method with the highest overall precision making it more suitable than MC and LiC for cases in which the costs of false positives (i.e. classifying trusted members as untrusted) are deemed high. Conversely, the recall and F1 values obtained in this experiment suggest that LiC would qualify better for cases where the penalty of false negatives (i.e. classifying untrusted members as trusted) is larger. In part, this is explained by the number and size of the communities generated by this method which, compared to MC and LE, result much larger. Nonetheless, the recall and F1 scores of LE are close to the ones of LiC in both, 2 and 3 , making it also a good approach in such a case with the advantage of being computationally more effective. Overall, the F1 values of LiC show that its loss in terms of precision is not so large. However, this metric along with the method's recall did not improve from configuration 1 to 2 (something that did happen with MC and LE). Furthermore, LiC produced much more false positives than MC or LE making it less suitable for cases in which Type 1 errors are considered critical. In part, this may be related to the approach followed by this method when partitioning the network space into overlapping communities. Particularly, LiC determines the optimal cut level of the resulting dendrogram through a measure of its partition density which tends to divide the network into many small communities. Moreover, such communities may in turn be included in larger ones which is not the case for LE nor MC. This has a direct impact in the detection of the community that best fits the user's privacy preferences in terms of size and composition. Hence, such an aspect should be further investigated and adjusted so the LiC algorithm becomes more suitable for access-control prediction. On the other hand, the results of Simulation 2 suggest that homophily can impact significantly the performance of community-based ACLs under information diffusion conditions. Likewise, such a performance is also affected by the number of seed nodes spreading the information across the network at = 0. Nevertheless, the largest effect size and the highest drop in the percentage of infected ACL members is given by the number of gatekeeper nodes removed from the network. Certainly, it is to expect that as more gatekeeper nodes get removed, fewer infections inside the corresponding ACL will be observed. However, this has also a negative impact on the trusted audience's extent since gatekeepers are, after all, nothing but trusted network members. Furthermore, as observed in Fig. 6 some trusted nodes get disconnected from the network as a consequence of applying such a removal strategy. Hence, such a collateral damage should be minimized so the influence range of the content being disclosed is not significantly reduced. Particularly, these side effects should be taken explicitly into consideration for the elaboration of an adequate gatekeeper removal criterion. To a certain extent, the results yielded by the simulation experiments of this work are subject to limitations. Particularly, such results may be affected by the set-up parameters of the simulation models as well as by the size and attribute characterization of the generated networks. On the one hand, the average size of ego-networks can largely differ from one OSN to another. For instance, it was estimated that around 38.35% of Facebook users in the United States had between 500 and 200 friends by 2016 3 . However, this number can easily reach the order of thousands in other OSNs like Instagram 4 . On the other hand, the type of attributes proposed in Section 4.2 as well as the distribution of their values may not necessarily represent actual OSNs conditions. Instead, it is to expect that certain attribute values will prevail over others and may not be equally distributed across the network members [58] . Finally, the probability of influence among OSNs users is subject to factors that go beyond attribute similarity. For instance, it can be affected by individual relations, time, and network centrality [34] . Hence, further experimental studies should closely consider these factors in order to characterize the IC model more adequately. As introduced in section 3.1, Kim et al. [28] defined a group-openness mechanism to investigate the role of homophily in the evolution of scale-free networks. Particularly, such approach considers that nodes sharing a particular attribute value are members of a common group . Then, the group-openness factor Λ between two groups and is defined as: where the homophily index Λ is a real number between 0 and 1 [29] . Particularly a value of Λ = 0 describes the case in which nodes in are completely reluctant to create ties with others who are members of group . Conversely, for Λ = 1, members of connect openly with other nodes outside their group. Such Λ values can be employed to define how strong (or weak) is the role of homophily between two nodes in terms of group membership. As mentioned in Section 4, the nodes of the networks analysed in this work are characterized with the attributes gender, workplace and location. Particularly, a node can adopt the values male or female for the ""gender"" attribute, Starbucks, Google, or Ikea for ""workplace"", and York or Leeds for ""location"". Therefore, each network consists of 7 groups making it possible to define up to 7,2 = 7! 2!(7−2)! = 21 group openness factors. For instance, Λ can be used to specify how open (or closed) is people from to connect with others from . Likewise, Λ can describe how likely are workers from to create links with others from . In sum, the information concerning all homophily factors of a network can be expressed through a group-openness matrix as shown in Fig 7. Consequently, the total homophily factor between a node and another node can be defined as: = groups to which node belongs = groups to which node belongs (2) where and are the group sets to which and belong, respectively. In the Barabasi and Albert model, a node's probability of creating new connections with others depends exclusively on its degree. However, Eq. 2 can be used to introduce the role of attribute similarity in the estimation of the attachment probability between network members. Consequently, the probability Π that a new node of group-set is linked to node of group-set is defined as: . = degree of node from group-set  = total homophily factor between group-set and group-set (3) where is the degree of node from group-set , and  represents the total homophily factor between the group-set of the new node and the group-set of node . This attachment rule describes the case in which a node without any connections is incorporated to the network. Nevertheless, new links may also emerge between existing network members over time. Particularly, such a probability Π that an existing node links to another existing one is defined as: where and are the degrees of node and of node respectively and  is the total homophily factor between their corresponding group-sets and . This attachment rule together with the one of Eq. 3 were used to generate the network topologies analysed in this paper.@story_separate@The experimental results of this work provide valuable insights into the role of homophily and information diffusion when applying community-based ACPMs. Particularly homophily was shown to be a critical aspect for the generation of adequate ACL configurations through communitydetection methods. In this sense, it is of paramount importance to have a good understanding of the homophily conditions at the network under analysis before applying clustering methods for ACL prediction. On the other hand, avoiding unwanted data dissemination remains an open challenge for access-control policies in OSNs. In principle, this issue can be mitigated by excluding a percentage of gatekeeper nodes from the members of the trusted audience. Nevertheless, side effects on the utility of information disclosure should be taken into consideration when applying such a countermeasure. For this, a removal criterion of gatekeeper nodes should seek to maximize the influence of the shared information while minimizing the chances of its propagation towards untrusted network segments. There are multiple questions and future research directions that arise from the results of this work. One of them corresponds to conducting a study of community-based ACPMs under actual network conditions. This includes an analysis of attribute similarity and influence processes in OSNs for an adequate characterization of the simulation models. Likewise, evaluating other community detection approaches for access-control prediction will be a matter of future investigations. On the other hand, we expect to explore the models and principles presented in this work on areas outside privacy and security. Particularly the removal of gatekeeper nodes under certain homophily conditions could be applied to the design of public health policies, for instance, in elaborating social distancing strategies to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In such a case, more specific models for the simulation of epidemic diseases will be investigated and evaluated along with the principles of gatekeeper removal discussed throughout this work.","Access-Control Lists (ACLs) (a.k.a. friend lists) are one of the most important privacy features of Online Social Networks (OSNs) as they allow users to restrict the audience of their publications. Nevertheless, creating and maintaining custom ACLs can introduce a high cognitive burden on average OSNs users since it normally requires assessing the trustworthiness of a large number of contacts. In principle, community detection algorithms can be leveraged to support the generation of ACLs by mapping a set of examples (i.e. contacts labelled as untrusted) to the emerging communities inside the user's ego-network. However, unlike users' access-control preferences, traditional community-detection algorithms do not take the homophily characteristics of such communities into account (i.e. attributes shared among members). Consequently, this strategy may lead to inaccurate ACL configurations and privacy breaches under certain homophily scenarios. This work investigates the use of community-detection algorithms for the automatic generation of ACLs in OSNs. Particularly, it analyses the performance of the aforementioned approach under different homophily conditions through a simulation model. Furthermore, since private information may reach the scope of untrusted recipients through the re-sharing affordances of OSNs, information diffusion processes are also modelled and taken explicitly into account. Altogether, the removal of gatekeeper nodes is further explored as a strategy to counteract unwanted data dissemination."
"Exercise testing is a well-established procedure, that has been extensively used for several decades in clinical and sub-clinical set-up. It is beyond the scope of this manuscript to provide detailed descriptions of these procedures, because exhaustive reports are available in previous publications of the American Heart Association (AHA), European Heart Association (EHA), and the American College of Sport Medicine (ACSM), to which interested readers can be referred [1] [2] [3] . This article is instead aimed to provide an overview of safety procedures for exercise testing during and after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have revealed that COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic, which has now infected many million patients around the world and has already caused a dramatic number of deaths. Despite the number of new cases has considerably stabilized or has even declined in some countries, a large number of COVID-19 patients will now experience long-term sequels impacting both the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems [4] . SARS-CoV-2 interplays with the pulmonary cardiovascular systems on multiple levels, not only increasing morbidity in patients with lungs and cardiovascular diseases, but also potentially exacerbating many underlying dysfunctions [5] . The causal agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, enter the host cells through its natural receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This protein is expressed at the surface of cells of many tissues and organs, such as nose, tongue, lung, heart, gastrointestinal system, adipose tissue, vascular endothelium, liver, kidney and testis, thus accounting the multiple organ dysfunction (MOF) that can develop in patients with severe/critical SARS-CoV-2 infection [6] . The presence of mild symptoms is disproportionate to the severity of illness [7] . The most common symptoms encompass fever (98%), cough (77%), dyspnea (63.5%) and muscle and joint soreness [8] . The rationale of symptoms distribution across organs is partially explained by the distribution and expression level of ACE-2, which is particularly enriched in above-mentioned organs and tissues [5, 6] .@story_separate@Asymptomatic individuals often present an apparently health status, however, they could still be positive to SARS-CoV-2 and potentially being contagious, although this last point is still a matter of debate toward the medical community. The use of safety procedures, though, becomes imperative in particular when testing an asymptomatic individual [10] . The lockdown period which has lasted for nearly 2 months and is actually involving several countries worldwide, obliged a large part of human population to sedentary behaviors, drastically reducing their physical activity level, and thus possibly reducing their cardiopulmonary health [11, 12] . Therefore, cardiopulmonary exercise testing could be beneficial, so that a safe and well-weighted return to pre-lockdown active lifestyle can be efficiently planned. Recent data on COVID-19 pandemic showed that the virus is mostly conveyed by respiratory droplets that are produced at high intensity especially when an infected subject coughs or sneezes. These droplets can be inhaled into the lungs of individuals in the close proximity (< 1 m), or can land on surfaces, where they can then be touched and transported by hand to the body [13] . Current WHO and National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are in agreement that standard, contact precautions with face mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves will be necessary. When performing procedures that encompass the risk of generating aerosol, such as exercise testing, additional PPE may be required, including controlled or powered air purifying respirators and specific face mask for the personnel in the close proximity of patients performing the test. These procedures should be followed both while testing post-COVID-19 patients most important when we test asymptomatic individuals. However, while with the former the main goal is to prevent the onset of a relapse (their possible contagious level is still a point of discussion), with asymptomatic subject (with unknown infection status) the risk is to underestimate their possible infectious. The subjects at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infectiveness are those who in close contact with COVID-19 patients, and thereby healthcare workers engaged assistance to the patients or laboratory staff engaged in handling biological samples of COVID-19 patients without recommended PPE or using unsuitable PPE (Table 1) . It is hence essential that the personnel involved is properly trained and educated on the risks of work-associated risk exposure, on the available prevention and protection measures, as well as on the clinical features of COVID-19. The most effective prevention measures that shall be applied in the healthcare sector, including personnel dedicated to the exercise testing procedure, are: • To frequently wash hand using soap or alcohol-based solution or hand sanitizing gel. • Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth with the hands; • Coughing or sneezing inside the elbow, with the arm bent or a handkerchief, preferably disposable, which must then be immediately eliminated; • Always wear a surgical mask and perform hand hygiene after removing the mask; • Avoid close contact by keeping the distance of at least 1 m (preferably 2 m, whenever feasible) from other people, especially those with respiratory symptoms. Additional precautions seem necessary, including the correct use of PPE along with appropriate education on their wearing, usage, undressing and elimination. This is especially important considering that although the leading means of SARS-CoV-2 transmission are through droplets and direct contact, specific maneuvers and other activities which may generate aerosols are also listed as potential risk procedures. Hand hygiene and appropriate use of PPE is hence always essential to prevent contact transmission. Nevertheless, PPE are effective for protecting operators only in combination with a larger set of measures introduced among administrative procedural and technical activities for promotion of health-care setting. In particular, in the current epidemiological scenario and with an ongoing risk of global shortage of PPE, the following WHO recommendations about the need to optimize their use shall be especially adopted: • Ensure appropriate use of PPE; • Ensure availability of a sufficient quantity and quality of PPE for protecting operators and people according to the specific risk of infection; • Coordinate the management of PPE supply chain. All the personnel involved in exercise testing procedure shall also be: 1. Appropriately trained and updated on occupational exposure risks and measures of prevention and protection; 2. Aware of the leading clinical features of COVID-19, so enabling timely identification and isolation of suspected cases; 3. Invited to participate to specific training and courses; 4. Aware of the importance of adopting standard precautions in assisting patients, with specific focus on hand hygiene before and after contacts with patients. The use of telemedicine remote diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunications technology is one of the leading measures to help preventing further spread of COVID-19 (Fig. 1 ). This technology, already used by various health care systems and hospitals [14] , is ideal in a pandemic scenario emergencies since it limit exposure to asymptomatic (but possibly contagious) individuals. Other essential principles are minimization of direct patient-personnel interactions and number of health-care specialist required for the management of each patient to the minimum required. In the current COVID-19 emergency situation, the PPE selection shall be based on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which depends on: • Means of transmission (especially through droplets and/ or direct contact); • Type of patient: the most contagious patients are those with cough and/or sneeze; if these patients wear a face • The contact is close (< 1 m) and prolonged (> 15 min). • The contact is repeated or continuous, so that it will increase the overall exposure time in the hospital and in other health care environments (such as for operators involved in repeated and/or continued medical assistance/evaluation of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases) • Performing maneuvers and procedures at high risk of producing aerosols, especially managing patient secretions. In a context of emergencies and lack of PPE, facial filters such as FFP2 or FFP3 must be prioritized for health care professionals engaged in areas where procedures are carried out to risk of aerosol generation such as gym, recreational association, sport association or during exercise testing. Table 1 describes the main PPEs that shall be used during exercise testing in post-COVID-19 scenario. During testing, parts in direct contact with patient skin or mucosa, masks used for gas exchange analyses, even small condensation droplets or aerosols are possible contaminants. Therefore, all potentially contaminated parts must be used according to the time requested to the cleaning, as indicated by the manufacturer [15] . Since the safety of patients and staff is extremely important, the European Respiratory Society (ERS) recommend • Lung function testing should be performed always with a high specification disposable in-line bacterial and viral filter in place (with minimum proven efficiency for high expiratory flow of 600-700 L/min). The use of disposable combined mouthpieces/sensors is not recommended at this time. The only exception is when a filter is added. • Maximize the use of single use consumables and dispose of the items with care e.g. nose clips, rubber mouthpieces, etc. • Where reusable items are utilized, they should be managed carefully and should be thoroughly cleaned as recommended by local infection control policy. • Use filters to minimize escape of aerosol from the exhalation ports when using nebulizers. • During exercise testing, the use of filters connected to the inhalation/exhalation port of the facemask or mouthpiece can reduce the aerosol transmission. This could result in an increase the resistance to airflow as the ventilatory demand of exercise increases (humidification of the filter and increase of the resistance at increased ventilatory flow), therefore, rendering the results of exercise less reliable, especially in dyspneic patients. However, more work needs to be done in this area before a consensus on their use can be agreed. Thus, the use of filters during exercise testing cannot be recommended and full PPE must be worn when conducting these tests. Re-usable parts, when properly maintained and reused according to these instructions, should be verified to function within basic specifications for a minimum of 50 cycles. Proper functioning of applicable parts after reprocessing shall be checked with both flowmeter and gas calibration, verifying that the values of all calibration factors are within acceptable range (Table 2 ) [17] . In preparing the devices for cardiopulmonary testing, or at the end of the test, the following general indications shall be considered: • Assign trained and qualified staff for handing and reuse of components. • Do not immerse the device or pour cleaning liquids over and into the device. • To minimize the infection risk and maintain optimal performance, verify that: • Device and re-usable parts are cleaned and disinfected prior their first usage • Single-use items are disposed after each test • Parts showing defects on material surfaces (cracks, brittleness) are disposed and standard personal protective (PPE) measures (hand hygiene, gloves, gown, mask, face shields) are always used when necessary • Re-usable parts are disinfected immediately after use Moreover, solutions for disinfection shall be: • Applied thoroughly to all surfaces of the instruments needing disinfection • Used according to the instructions and the length of contact provided by the manufacturer • Always stored and prepared in clearly marked containers, thus preventing accidental use/misuse Rinsing is a very important activity in the reprocessing procedure, aimed to remove organic material, lubricants, or even cleaning agents that can deactivate the chemical liquid disinfectants and thus inhibit the anti-microbial effect. Sterile water is recommended for rinsing, when available, though the use of potable tap water can also be accepted [18, 19] . The pretreatment should be completed as soon as possible after use. When choosing a suitable detergent and disinfectant, it shall be considered that: • Manufacturer's safety precautions must be strictly observed, and adapted for cleaning and disinfection of metal and plastic instruments; • The agent used has proven antimicrobial efficacy (e.g., CE marked or legally marketed in the US); • The chemicals are compatible with re-usable parts; • The manufacturer's specifications on concentration and reaction time must be always respected. Disassembled components need to be reassembled after reprocessing. After cleaning and disinfection, the o-rings shall be lubricated with medical grade biocompatible Vaseline.@story_separate@This article is aimed to provide an overview of safety procedures for exercise testing during and after COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. The safety recommendations presented in this manuscript applied into exercise physiology laboratory, gym, sport association, etc. and integrated with updated local guidelines according to the local laws and WHO safety recommendations for the COVID-19 pandemic.","Recent data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic showed that the virus is mostly conveyed by respiratory droplets that are produced at high intensity especially when an infected subject coughs or sneezes. Therefore, elevated volume ventilations, usually reached during physical efforts and exercise, are a potential source of contamination. On the other hand, the lockdown period which has lasted for nearly 2 months and is actually involving several countries worldwide, obliged a large part of human population to sedentary behaviors, drastically reducing their physical activity level, and reducing their cardiopulmonary fitness. Therefore, cardiopulmonary exercise testing could be beneficial, so that a safe and well-weighted return to pre-lockdown active lifestyle can be efficiently planned. However, specific guidelines on exercise testing safety procedures in the era of COVID-19 are unavailable so far. This article is aimed to provide an overview of safety procedures for exercise testing during and after COVID-19 worldwide pandemic."
"Investigations over the past half century have shown that protein kinase CK2 is a multifaceted master regulator of cell function in both normal and disease states [1] [2] [3] [4] . CK2 has enzymatic activity as a monomer (CK2α or CK2α') or as a tetramer with two α and/or α' catalytic subunits linked via two β subunits, which serve a regulatory role. This highly conserved kinase phosphorylates primarily serine and threonine amino acids. Phosphosites for CK2 number close to one thousand (phosphositeplus website [5] ) and these substrate proteins are found in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, organelles, and subdomains; thus, the abundance of CK2 targets underpins its involvement in a large number of cellular activities [6] . In the context of cancer cells, CK2 functions in a global sense to promote cell growth and proliferation and suppress apoptosis [7] . In the majority of cancers, increased CK2 activity and expression relative to normal tissue is well documented [8, 9] . In head Detroit-562 and Fadu cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (SH30024.01, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn pooled) were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (A13401) and grown as recommended by the manufacturer. All cell lines were grown in an incubator at 37 • C with 5% CO 2 . All transformed cells were tested for mycoplasma and were maintained in culture for up to 2 months. CX-4945 was made up as a 40 mM stock in DMSO (AdooQ Bioscience, Irvine, CA, USA). Cisplatin was obtained from the Minneapolis VA hospital pharmacy at a concentration of 1 mg/mL.@story_separate@Standard chemistry siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The siCK2α sense strand sequence is 5 -auacaacccaaacuccacauuu-3 [25] . The CK2α' sense strand sequence is 5 -auacagcccaaacuccacauuu-3 [25] . The CK2α and CK2α' siRNAs were cotransfected in a ratio of 3:1. The control siRNA (siControl) used was siNon-targeting #2 (Dharmacon; D-001810-02). Transfections of siRNA were performed on 60 mm plates with cells at 40-50% confluence using Dharmafect 1 and 2 reagents using 10 µL of Dharmafect and 20 nM siRNA total concentration [26] . For siRNA/cisplatin experiments, cells were trypsinized from 60 mm plates after 24 h of transfection, and transferred into 96-well plates (Primaria, Thermo Fisher Scientific; Detroit-562 3500 cells; Fadu 2500 cells). Cisplatin was added at 48 h of transfection in a 2-fold dilution series from 20 to 0.62 µM. Viability assays were performed at 96 h of siRNA transfection and 48 h of cisplatin treatment. Success of transfection was judged by visual confirmation on 96-well plates that siCK2 transfected cells (without cisplatin) were 2-4-fold less confluent with predominantly apoptotic morphology compared to siControl transfected cells, which were not apoptotic. Calculation of IC50 values used siControl as the comparator control treatment. For CX-4945/cisplatin experiments, cells were plated into 96-well Primaria plates (Detroit-562 4000 cells; Fadu 3000 cells; UM-SCC-6 6000 cells; UM-SCC-47 6000 cells; 93-Vu-147T 6000 cells). CX-4945 was added in a 2-fold dilution series from 50 to 0.39 µM for Detroit-562 and Fadu and from 100 to 0.78 µM in UM-SCC-6, UM-SCC-47, and 93-Vu-147T. Cisplatin was added in a 2-fold dilution series from 80 to 0.62 µM. DMSO was added to cisplatin treated cells at the same concentration as used for CX-4945 single treatments to control for DMSO effects. Viability was measured at 72 h of CX-4945 and 48 h of cisplatin treatment. Calculation of IC50 values used untreated cells as the comparator control treatment. CellTiter 96 ® Aqueous One or CellTiter-Blue ® Assays (Promega Corp., Fitchburg, WI, USA) were used to assess cell viability following treatments. Assays were performed according to the manufacturer instructions [27] . Absorbance was measured at 490 nm for Aqueous One and at 560 nm excitation/590 nm emission for CellTiter Blue using a Molecular Devices 5 plate reader with absorbance values for media alone subtracted from the experimental values. Detroit-562 and Fadu cells were transfected as described above. After 24 h of transfection, cisplatin was added to cells to a final concentration of 1 µM for an additional 24 h. For CX-4945/cisplatin treatments, CX-4945 was added to cells for a total of 48 h and cisplatin for a total of 24 h. The drug concentrations (µM) for CX-4945/cisplatin for each cell line were as follows: Detroit-562 1.5/5; Fadu 2.5/5; all others 5/5. Cell pellets were processed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer, and 20 µg of each lysate was subjected to electrophoresis using TGX 5-15% midi gel system (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and wet tank transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, as described [28] . After transfer, the membranes were fully dried, rehydrated in nano-pure water, and blocked for 30 min with 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad 170-6404) or 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma A-9647) in Tris buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) at room temperature. Antibodies were diluted into fresh blocking buffer according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and the membranes processed as described [28] . Antibodies used: CK2α (A300-197A) and CK2α' (A300-199A) from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX, USA); CK2α' (CSNK2A2) from ABclonal (A1616; Woburn, MA, USA); CK2β (sc-46666), NFκB p65 P-S529 (sc-101751), RB (sc-102), and actin (sc-1616) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA); NFκB p65 (6956), Bax (2772), Bak (121505), p21 (2947), PDCD4 (9535), p53 (48818), AKT-1 (2967), and AKT-1 P-S129 (13461) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using Pierce SuperSignal West Pico Plus and Dura substrates (Pierce 34580, 34076). Chemiluminescent signal was detected using the LiCor Odyssey Fc instrument, with quantitation performed using Image Studio 5.2. Table 2 includes descriptive statistics. PDCD4 immunoblot data was analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test (2-sided) . Viability curves and IC50 calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Synergy calculations for combination index were performed using Compusyn [29] . We evaluated CK2 levels and surrogate activity in representative HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell lines. In order to evaluate CK2 subunit expression in HNSCC cell lines, we employed 3 HPV+ and 3 HPV-cell lines and a non-transformed human epithelial keratinocyte cell line (Table 1) . Under standard growth conditions, CK2 subunit protein expression was examined by immunoblot analysis. The three subunits of CK2 were well expressed in all cell lines (Figure 1 ), and steady-state expression levels were 1.4-1.9-fold higher in HPV+ cell lines compared to HPV-( Table 2; Table S1 ). We also investigated markers of CK2 activity; specifically, phosphorylation of the CK2-specific sites on NFκB p65 (S529) and AKT-1 (S129) [30, 31] . CK2 phosphorylation of NFκB p65 at S529 was dramatically higher in HPV(+) compared to HPV(−) cell lines ( Figure 1 , Table 2 ). In contrast, AKT-1 phosphorylation at the CK2 site was roughly equivalent in both types of HNSCC cells. Expression of p53 was detected in all cell lines, with much higher levels in the cells with mutant p53. Overall levels of pRb were similar in all cell lines, with higher molecular weight species evident in the HPV(−) cell lines. Given the widespread clinical use of cisplatin therapy for both HPV(+) and HPV(−) HNSCC cases and the general reliance of HNSCC cells on CK2 activity, we investigated the potential utility of combined CX-4945 treatment with cisplatin treatment [32, 33] . Specifically, we evaluated the viability of HNSCC cells after cisplatin, CX-4945, and combined CX-4945 followed by cisplatin treatment. Adding CX-4945 to cisplatin treatment further reduced cell viability over cisplatin alone and significantly decreased the IC50 for cisplatin for all cell lines but UM-SCC-47. The fold decrease with the addition of CX-4945 ranged from 1.7 to 7.9 (Table 3 and Figure 2A ). In reverse analysis, when we determined the effect of cisplatin addition to CX-4945, the effect was to slightly reduce the IC50 for CX-4945, from 1.1 to 2.0-fold (Table 3 ). These results suggest that under the treatment conditions that we used, CX-4945 treatment was the dominant effect reducing cell viability in both HPV(+) and HPV(−) cells. We analyzed this data for synergy and found that CX-4945 and cisplatin combined treatment was synergistic in the HPV(+) cell line UM-SCC-47 and the HPV(−) cell line Fadu (Figure 2A ). CX-4945 and cisplatin combined treatment was additive in the HPV(−) cell line SCC-6 ( Figure 2A ). We also examined the viability of Detroit-562 and Fadu cells following siRNA-mediated CK2 downregulation and cisplatin treatment. Cells were transfected with a constant amount of either CK2-targeting or control siRNAs and treated 2 days later with cisplatin for an additional 48 h. Similar to the combined effects of CX-4945 with cisplatin, the viability curve was shifted to the left with significantly reduced IC50s for cisplatin when CK2 expression was inhibited by 4 to 21-fold ( Figure 2B ). Immunoblot analysis of cultured cell lines, as indicated above the blots. CK2α and CK2α' antibodies were combined for simultaneous detection of these 2 proteins. Proteins detected are indicated on the right side of the blots. Molecular mass markers are indicated on the left side of the blots. Actin signal was used as the loading control.  We further examined treatment response to CX-4945 treatment alone and in combination with cisplatin in 3 HPV(−) and 2 HPV(+) cell lines by immunoblot. We examined the cells, using sequential treatment, with CX-4945 treatment for 48 h and cisplatin treatment for 24 h. This relatively short treatment regimen was chosen to examine CX-4945-induced changes in HPV(−) and HPV(+) HNSCC cells prior to the full cascade of death signaling. Overall, CX-4945 treatment alone or combined with cisplatin caused no consistent change in the proapoptotic proteins Bak and Bax; although some induction of Bak and Bax was observed in UM-SCC-6 and 93-Vu-147T cells (Figure 3 ). CX-4945 caused induction of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 from 1.4-to 4.6-fold in four of the cell lines; the presence of cisplatin generally reversed p21 induction in combined treatment. Cisplatin treatment alone caused reduction of p21 below 60% of control cells (Figure 3) . Levels of the tumor suppressor programmed cell death 4 protein (PDCD4) were elevated 1.5-to 5-fold following CX-4945 inhibition in four of the five cell lines, with further increase upon cisplatin addition in two of these cell lines. Addition of cisplatin to CX-4945 treatment slightly increased CK2 protein levels in four of the five cell lines. Detroit-562 and Fadu cells were also transfected with a siRNA cocktail to specifically knockdown CK2α and CK2α' protein expression. Reduced expression of the CK2 subunits was confirmed (Figure 4) . Many of the observations from CX-4945 treatments were replicated for Detroit-562, including induction of p21 and PDCD4 by loss of CK2 ( Figure 4) . One difference was that Bax levels increased following downregulation of CK2 combined with cisplatin as opposed to CX-4945 plus cisplatin treatment. The response of Fadu cells to siRNA-mediated CK2 loss with and without cisplatin was very similar to that for the use of CX-4945, with the exception that CK2 downregulation did not induce PDCD4. CK2 knockdown in these two cell lines only slightly induced PDCD4 mRNA (Detroit-562: 1.36 ± 0.49; Fadu: 1.09 ± 0.07).  Given the rise in HPV-related HNSCC, we undertook this examination of CK2 level in relation to HPV status and the effect of CK2 targeting as a cotreatment with cisplatin. We observed higher steady-state CK2 protein levels and kinase activity directed to NFκB p65 in HPV(+) cells relative to HPV(−). It appears that under conditions of HPV infection, CK2 protein levels are elevated by a currently unknown mechanism to meet the demands of viral replication. CK2 regulates HPV proteins such as E1 and E7 involved in the papillomavirus lifecycle. The HPV E7 oncoprotein promotes immortalization and transformation in infected cells through inactivation of pRb and related pathway proteins [34] . Previous studies have demonstrated key regulation of E7 function by CK2 [18] [19] [20] 35] . For example, the phosphorylation of E7 by CK2 is essential to promote Rb-related p130 degradation and cell cycle S-phase entry [36, 37] . CK2α is required for HPV DNA replication by regulating the stability and nuclear retention of E1, and CK2 has been proposed as a promising target for the development of antiviral drugs [21, 38] . Cervical cancer is almost entirely associated with positive HPV status. In other work, it was shown that targeting of CK2 activity using an investigational peptide inhibitor is effective in treating cervical cancer [39, 40] . This CK2 inhibitor, CIGB-300, was identified in a screen of peptides, which bind and block phosphorylation of an HPV16 E7 fusion protein [41] . Combinatorial use of CIGB-300 with cisplatin demonstrated a good synergy and/or additivity profile against a cervical cancer cell line, and improved survival in mouse xenograft studies [42] . These observations are analogous to those described here on the combinatorial treatment of HNSCC with CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 and cisplatin. Treatment of malignant cells with cisplatin and/or radiation causes nuclear DNA damage and redox stress, mitochondrial DNA damage, and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization [43] [44] [45] . Over time, adaptation to cisplatin in malignant cells results in therapeutic failure and tumor recurrence in patients. We have previously shown in prostate cancer that CK2 inhibition has a negative impact on mitochondrial health through decreased membrane potential and Ca 2+ flux [27, 46] . CK2 has significant influence on numerous DNA repair and other pathways activated by radiation and cisplatin [27, [47] [48] [49] ; loss of CK2 improves sensitivity to cisplatin or radiation in numerous cancers, including head and neck cancer [42, [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . CX-4945 blocks DNA repair after cisplatin or gemcitabine treatment [51, 63] , and next generation platinum Pt(IV) prodrugs conjugated with CX-4945 have shown efficacy in other cancer types [64] . In a pilot study, metastatic HNSCC lesions were successfully treated in nude mice using a combination of cisplatin and tumor directed nanocapsules containing RNAi oligonucleotides against CK2 [65] . Together, these data suggest that incorporating CK2 blockade could improve or prolong the response to cisplatin therapy by hindering DNA repair and influencing mitochondrial health in both HPV(+) and HPV(−) HNSCC [66] . A key downstream target of CK2 activity in HNSCC is NFκB. The NFκB complex plays broad roles promoting proliferative and inflammatory pathways, and is aberrantly activated in numerous cancers, including HNSCC [65, 67] . CK2 modulates IKKβ and IκBα phospho-states and degradation, promotes IKK-mediated phosphorylation of NFκB p65 at S536, and directly activates p65 by phosphorylation at S529 [65] . We have previously shown that CK2 knockdown modulates NFκB activity and sensitizes HPV(−) HNSCC cells to cisplatin [50] . Our data here show a new link between high CK2 levels and CK2activated NFκB, but not CK2-activated AKT-1, in HPV(+) HNSCC cells. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that NFκB and death signaling pathways differed according to HPV status [68] . Future studies could further investigate CK2 signaling in HPV(+) HNSCC in relation to NFκB activity and induction of cell death. Loss of tumor suppressor gene or protein expression is proposed as part of HNSCC oncogenesis [14] . It was previously shown in HNSCC that molecular downregulation or kinase inhibition of CK2 enhanced levels of the tumor suppressor TAp73 and inhibited expression of cancer stem cell genes and side population [50, 69] . The tumor suppressor PDCD4 protects cells from neoplastic transformation, exhibits reduced expression levels in malignant compared to non-transformed cells, and functions to inhibit protein translation [70] [71] [72] . PDCD4 protein expression is regulated by multiple microRNAs in HNSCC, and loss of PDCD4 renders cancer cells more resistant to cisplatin [73] [74] [75] . PDCD4 interacts with CK2 in the nucleus and is a predicted CK2 substrate [76, 77] . Our results showed for the first time that PDCD4 protein levels were strongly induced in HNSCC by CX-4945 treatment, especially in the p53 mutant cell lines Detroit-562, Fadu and 93-Vu-147T. CK2 knockdown using siRNA inexplicably raised PDCD4 in Detroit-562 but not Fadu cells. At present it is unclear what molecular pathways or genetic characteristics influence PDCD4 abundance following interruption of CK2 activity or expression. CX-4945 treatment or CK2 downregulation also strongly induced tumor suppressor p21 levels, a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor promoting cell cycle arrest [78] . Induction of p21 was shown to occur when cisplatin-resistant HPV(−) HNSCC cells were resensitized using palbociclib and JQ1 [79] . Here we observed increased p21 protein after CX-4945 treatment in both HPV(+) and HPV(−) HNSCC. Elevation of p21 is due to CK2 knockdown in two of two cell lines and CX-4945 treatment in four of five cell lines. We noted a different CX-4945 related p21 molecular response in the Fadu cell line. The heterogeneity of malignancies observed in patients and the corresponding cancer cell lines has emerged as a fundamental tenet of cancer studies over the past many years. It is not unusual that the HNSCC cell lines we employed in this study occasionally showed different responses to experimental manipulation, and in fact this is to be expected. Thus, we conclude that in most HNSCC cell lines, blocking CK2 activity or expression allows elevation of p21. The recovery of PDCD4 protein levels and the induction of p21 and TAp73 may represent potential mechanisms by which reducing CK2 activity or expression levels improves cisplatin sensitivity in HNSCC cells. Ongoing clinical trials continue to support the potential efficacy of CX-4945 in different therapeutic contexts in a range of malignancies (clinicaltrials.gov). The small molecule inhibitor CX-4945 is not solely selective for CK2 activity, due to some off-target inhibition of and/or interaction with several other kinases [80, 81] . In light of the off-target effects of CX-4945, it is important to note that data from studies using CX-4945 significantly overlap with data generated in vivo and in vitro by knockdown of CK2 gene expression, as shown here and in numerous other cancer types [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] . A recent summary of an original research publication states that the development of a new highly selective chemical probe for CK2 ""challenges the broad cancer essentiality of CK2"" [93] . The chemical probe SGC-CK2-1 did not cause notable loss of proliferation in greater than 90% of more than 140 cancer cell lines, which was a surprising finding [94] . However, there was no discussion of published data on the effects of CK2 knockdown using RNA interference and CRISPR/Cas9 techniques. The strong foundation of evidence that molecular downregulation of CK2 protein levels induces loss of cancer cell viability and tumor cell death should not be discounted. Further research using SGC-CK2-1 will hopefully shed some light on this observed discrepancy. Current therapy of HNSCC relies on surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy, typically cisplatin. A significant number of patients, especially those with HPV(−) disease, suffer poor outcomes after therapy; while patients who experience long-term benefits also develop persistent cisplatin-related toxicity. This study shows significantly reduced IC50 values for cisplatin in multiple HPV(+) and HPV(−) HNSCC cell lines under combined treatment with CX-4945 or after CK2 knockdown, suggesting a path toward a therapy strategy allowing reduced cisplatin usage. HNSCC is the 6th most common cancer in the world, and new treatment modalities that can improve outcomes and reduce toxicities are needed [14, 95, 96] . We summarized in Figure 6 the results presented here and in other published works related to loss of CK2 activity and potential pathways of achieving improved HNSCC response.  Extended work could examine cisplatin treatment as the first drug since the CX-4945 treatment dominated the loss of viability in these studies, as suggested by the data in Table 3 . The possible off-target effects of CX-4945 are well documented, and further investigation into the role of CK2 downregulation through the use of other inhibitors and/or CK2 molecular downregulation and would define the contribution of off-target kinases.@story_separate@To our knowledge, this is the first report evaluating CK2 expression level in relation to HPV status in HNSCC cells. Treatment with CX-4945 resulted in significantly decreased IC50 values for combined treatment with cisplatin in both HPV(+) and HPV(−) HNSCC cell lines; synergy was observed in a subset of cell lines. Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials demonstrated that the oral CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 is safe for use in cancer patients, slowing disease progression and extending treatment benefit for some patients with advanced solid tumor cancers. Our results suggest that HNSCC patients could benefit from further investigation into the incorporation of CX-4945 into treatment strategies. In addition, the function of CK2 in HPV biology as it pertains to HNSCC requires further study given the emergence of HPV(+) HNSCC.","Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) can be categorized into human papillomavirus (HPV) positive or negative disease. Elevated protein kinase CK2 level and activity have been historically observed in HNSCC cells. Previous studies on CK2 in HNSCC did not generally include consideration of HPV(+) and HPV(−) status. Here, we investigated the response of HPV(+) and HPV(−) HNSCC cells to CK2 targeting using CX-4945 or siRNA downregulation combined with cisplatin treatment. HNSCC cell lines were examined for CK2 expression levels and activity and response to CX-4945, with and without cisplatin. CK2 levels and NFκB p65-related activity were high in HPV(+) HNSCC cells relative to HPV(−) HNSCC cells. Treatment with CX-4945 decreased viability and cisplatin IC50 in all cell lines. Targeting of CK2 increased tumor suppressor protein levels for p21 and PDCD4 in most instances. Further study is needed to understand the role of CK2 in HPV(+) and HPV(−) HNSCC and to determine how incorporation of the CK2-targeted inhibitor CX-4945 could improve cisplatin response in HNSCC."
"Escalating demand on elective and non-elective paediatric services is of national concern. It is generating unsustainable pressure on medical, nursing and administrative staff, poor patient experience and increasing cost for commissioners. [1] [2] [3] National RCPCH standards emphasise increased consultant input and collaboration of primary and secondary care services to reduce unnecessary paediatric attendances and outpatient reviews, whilst ensuring children are managed effectively in the community. [4] [5] Evidence for the most effective interventions to achieve this is lacking [2, 6] and few studies have examined the impact of combined initiatives targeting both acute and outpatient paediatric referrals. [7] At the time of writing, during the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual consultations and community-based management have replaced many face-to-face paediatric reviews. This reinforces the need to explore alternative out-of-hospital integrated care pathways. The Paediatric Demand Management (PDM) service was established at the Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust in January 2017. The aim of the service is to manage both inpatient and outpatient paediatric referrals more efficiently by scheduling paediatric consultants to triage all referrals, run daily rapid access clinics and provide direct advice and guidance to primary healthcare professionals. We proposed that this new service would facilitate supported management of a significant number of outpatient and acute inpatient referrals in primary care. Other anticipated benefits included upskilling of General Practitioners and decreased costs for commissioners. This review presents an evaluation of our PDM service. Prior to the introduction of the PDM service, children were referred to the PAU via a middle grade doctor or senior house officer. Outpatient paediatric referrals were communicated by letter or electronic referral system, without any prior discussion with the paediatric team.

Some elements of the service trialled previously by the department were deemed unsuccessful due to the lack of consultant availability for the additional responsibilities. A locum consultant was therefore appointed in January 2017, enabling one general paediatric consultant to be allocated to the PDM service each weekday. The PDM consultant's daily responsibilities included:  Telephone advice and guidance to primary healthcare practitioners via a dedicated consultant mobile between 0900 and 1700  Providing advice and guidance via a dedicated email address, including reviewing photographs, ECGs and videos  Daily rapid access clinics including same-day appointments  Active triage of all outpatient paediatric referrals, including facilitating direct referral to other specialist services and supporting management of patients in primary care if appropriate. We performed a mixed-methods service evaluation of all patients referred and triaged through the PDM service over a two-year pilot period. Our aim was to review usage of the service and describe its impact through referral outcomes, admission and referral avoidance, primary care and patient feedback, and financial analysis. Data for every contact with the PDM service was collected prospectively on a departmental database to enable service evaluation and regular reporting to commissioners. We analysed this data and quantified the following outcomes:  Method and reasons for contact  Referral outcomes  Management of ten most common presenting complaints  GP and patient feedback from online surveys Patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination plans of our study. Data collated for 7162 patients managed via the PDM service over a two-year period from January 2017 to January 2019 were reviewed. Electronic outpatient referrals (31.5%) and telephone calls (31.4%) were the most utilised means of contact, followed by outpatient referral letter (18.3%), email (14.2%) and fax (3.6%). A small proportion of referrals (1%) were re-directed by the PAU middle grade doctor. The most frequent reason for contact with the service was referral for a routine paediatric outpatient clinic (44.4%). Referrals for an urgent or soon clinic appointment constituted 21.2% of contacts.

The remainder included referral to the PAU (9.4%), and requests to expedite a pre-existing referral (2.7%) (figure 1). More than a quarter (28.4%) of all referrals via the PDM service were managed with advice only and a further 11.4% were diverted towards a more appropriate service. Just over half (53.8%) of requests for PAU attendance were managed alternatively, resulting in admission avoidance in 364 patients. Of those cases, 53.6% were given advice and 35.7% were offered a rapid access clinic appointment. We analysed the number of GP referred admissions to PAU throughout the pilot period. Data for the five years preceding the pilot showed a year on year increase in admissions (average 17% per year). Year one pilot data demonstrated a 10% reduction in PAU admissions. Year two demonstrated a slight (2.5%) increase in admissions, but still a significant contrast with the previous trend. Approximately half of requests for an urgent clinic (49.2%) or soon clinic (47.5%) were accepted, however 27.3% were managed without face-to-face contact. The majority of routine clinic referrals (64.2%) were deemed appropriate, with a small proportion (6.4%) being offered an earlier review (PAU attendance, urgent or soon clinic). The remainder were managed alternatively, 13.8% with advice or re-directing the issue to their known consultant and 15.7% signposted to another service. In total 1285 of all 4703 (27.3%) outpatient referrals were managed without a clinic appointment ( figure   2 ). The ten most common presenting complaints identified in this patient cohort are outlined in Figure 3 . Referrals for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and lymphadenopathy were managed with advice only in almost half of cases. Patients referred with confirmed or suspected seizures were most commonly offered an urgent or soon clinic appointment. For the remaining seven presenting complaints, the most frequent outcome was a routine outpatient review. For six of the top ten presenting complaints, at least a quarter of referrals were managed without face-to-face contact. Invitations to complete an online survey regarding usage and feedback on the PDM service were sent to all local GP practices. Seventy-two responses from 37 GP practices were received. Respondents reported usage of multiple communication channels; telephone 81.3%, email 63.4%, letter 19.7% and e-referral 21.1%. The majority of contacts were managed with advice only (62%). In 35.2% of cases the patient was seen more urgently than expected, whereas in 11.3% of cases the patient was seen less urgently than expected. Feedback suggested very high satisfaction rates with 100% respondents stating they were ""quite likely"" or ""very likely"" to use the telephone and/or email service again and 94.4% reporting satisfaction with the opinion they were given. The majority (64%) of respondents stated that the contact they had had with the team would change how they manage a patient in the future. The 48 free text responses were overwhelmingly positive (Box 1). To evaluate patient experience, a three-question questionnaire was sent to 474 families that had been managed via the Demand Management pathway. We received 30 responses (6% response rate). Twenty-three (77%) expressed satisfaction with the service; 2 were somewhat satisfied; and 5 not satisfied. Of those who were not satisfied, comments related to appointment booking issues (2) , delay in subsequent investigations (1), being prescribed antibiotics without a consultation (2), and a ""Saves us and patients (and hopefully hospital) a lot of time and improves care. Consultants always really helpful and even do some teaching at the same time with us. This is amazing because we can then cascade this to the other GPs at the practice to influence ongoing care"" ""Used the telephone advice line when urgent appointment seemed to go missing. even emailed in a video of a suspected seizure in a patient which was reviewed by two consultants within 24hrs and outpatient appt/long wait avoided for the patient. I hope this service can continue its been very valuable"" ""Excellent service as always -find this so convenient and useful, and definitely results in fewer referrals from me!"" ""the email service is very much appreciated. It's a way to communicate in a timely manner, without the interruption of a phone call, it's also a written record which can be copied and pasted directly into the records. Consultants often include their phone number in case further discussion is needed"" ""Very responsive, very helpful, and as implied above, the advice has given me confidence to manage similar cases myself in the future -this easy process helps avoid letters and delays and I'm sure avoids referrals to clinic"" ""Really useful service, well designed to fit in with how primary care works. Always quickly responded to and has stopped several referrals on the occasions where I have used it"" 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  perceived delay in the process when child did ultimately need to be seen. These issues were addressed in the following ways:  Undertaking a phone consultation with the family when antibiotics were to be prescribed, or other significant change in expectations  Ensuring advice and guidance was communicated via letter to both GP and family  Explaining that if a future appointment became necessary where it was not offered initially, the first contact date would be considered the start of the pathway Eighteen free text comments from patient feedback highlighted the efficiency and quality of the service. The traditional Payment by Results policy, whereby reducing departmental activity would result in reduced income, required the implementation of an alternative financial arrangement with our commissioners. During the pilot phase the CCGs financed the additional consultant time. In addition to guaranteeing a reduction in outpatient activity and admissions to PAU, we agreed that appointments in the rapid access clinic, and calls placed via Consultant Connect, would be tariff-free. During the two-year pilot period, 2651 clinic appointments and 364 PAU admissions were avoided. This produced estimated cost savings to the CCGs of greater than £400,000 per year. Our service evaluation indicates that PDM has achieved its aim of facilitating the management of a significant number of paediatric referrals without face-to-face contact. This reversed the year-on-year increase in PAU admissions and outpatient clinic appointments and provided more than £400,000 annual cost savings to the CCGs. The provision of advice and guidance via telephone and email has improved accessibility of paediatric consultants to primary care. This has brought compliance with national standards [5] and overwhelmingly positive feedback from GPs. GPs found this particularly valuable when used during their consultation with the family still present in the room. This enabled the paediatrician to ascertain additional information from the family, for the family to hear advice directly from the paediatrician, and the timely communication of a management plan. Although email advice was sought less frequently, the capacity to share pictures and video recordings was highly valued and 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  often used as an adjunct to pre-existing referrals. It also allowed time for a more considered response, having undertaken a brief literature review, or consultation with a colleague with additional specialist experience. The benefits of provision of direct advice and guidance to GPs with respect to alleviating paediatric hospital activity has been described in several published studies. [8] [9] [10] The added educational benefit to GPs is highlighted in our feedback. Over half of referrals to our PAU via this service were avoided over the two-year period, which surpassed initial expectations and relieved pressure on the acute workforce. Our results are comparable with a previous study [6] in which 50% PAU walk-in attendees were deemed suitable for community management. Unplanned same-day hospital attendances can cause significant disruption and anxiety for families and may expose children to unnecessary investigations, inevitable waits for assessment and reviews, and hospital-acquired infections. Empowering GPs to manage cases in the community offers convenience, increased satisfaction and confidence in primary care influencing future presentations. [10] [11] [12] Most of the literature on reducing secondary care activity focuses on acute paediatric presentations. However, we also observed a significant impact on our outpatient referrals. Just over a quarter were managed without a face-to-face paediatric review, with either advice or diversion to an appropriate service, ensuring that patients see the right person, first time. Those offered a clinic appointment often had investigations or treatment instigated in advance, avoiding delays in diagnosis and unnecessary follow-up appointments. We lacked follow-up data on patient outcomes including re-presentation rates for those managed without seeing a paediatrician. However, we have not received any feedback suggesting dissatisfaction since ensuring that GP's and families receive a copy of advice and guidance correspondence. Analysis of presenting complaints provides an insight into primary care case mix and incentive for educating GP colleagues, almost half of whom have had no formal paediatric training. [5] All but one of our top ten presenting complaints are included in Birmingham Children's Hospital top 20 outpatient paediatric conditions [13] implying that these are generalisable. Just under half of PDM referrals for patients with GORD and lymphadenopathy were managed with advice only. GP feedback implies appreciation of the educational value of direct case discussion, informing future practice, and this could be expanded further. Strengths of our review include its large sample size and representation of a two-year time period, reducing potential confounding factors such as seasonal variation and varying staffing levels. We acknowledge that our data are limited to a service unique to our department whose success is dependent upon a significant investment in consultant time. However, our cost analysis shows that this investment has been far outweighed by the savings received by commissioning groups. As a result of the success of the two-year pilot, the PDM service is now permanently embedded in our department. Opportunities for developing this further include establishing partnerships between paediatricians and General Practice clusters, to improve the quality of community-based management, and enable earlier intervention to avoid the need for future referrals in some cases. This has been successfully implemented as part of the connecting care for children model in North West London, [12] boosting confidence in and usage of GP services by parents. This could be trialled virtually in the first instance through joint telephone and video consultations in view of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Inclusion of paediatric trainees, who spend a disproportionate amount of time in acute services, [14] would also enhance understanding of referral processes and develop capabilities in appropriate triage. This has reversed the increasing trend of PAU admissions from primary care of preceding years. Financial analysis suggested the avoidance of these clinic appointments and PAU admissions provided a substantial cost saving.  Increasing demand on acute and elective paediatric services throughout the UK is unsustainable  The PDM service was initiated as a two-year pilot project in January 2017, following approval and financial support from BaNES and Wiltshire clinical commissioning groups (CCG's). Individual elements constituting PDM were chosen based on RCPCH recommendations [4] [5] and perceived success in other UK paediatric departments. Some of these were trialled previously by the department (consultant mobile and ad hoc clinics) but deemed unsuccessful due to the lack of dedicated consultant availability for the additional responsibilities. A locum consultant was therefore appointed in January 2017, enabling one general paediatric consultant to be allocated to the PDM service each weekday. This role was rotated through six consultants with two covering the majority of the rota. The PDM consultant's daily responsibilities included: Referral pathways and outcomes before and after implementation of PDM are outlined in figure 1 . The PAU middle grade doctor continued to receive the majority of same-day admission referrals but could re-direct these to the PDM consultant where admission avoidance was anticipated. Discussion of acute referrals was also extended to paramedics' post implementation. We performed a mixed-methods service evaluation of all patients referred and triaged through the PDM service over a two-year pilot period. Our aim was to review use of the service and describe its impact through referral outcomes, admission and referral avoidance, primary care and patient feedback, and financial analysis.

Electronic outpatient referrals (2254; 31.5%) and telephone calls (2252; 31.4%) were the most utilised means of contact, followed by outpatient referral letter (1312; 18.3%) and email (1014; 14.2%). A small proportion of referrals (69; 1%) were re-directed by the PAU doctor. The most frequent reason for contacting PDM was a routine paediatric outpatient referral (3183; 44.4%). Referrals for an urgent (within two weeks) or soon (within six weeks) clinic appointment constituted 1520 (21.2%) of contacts. A significant proportion of contacts were for advice only (1592; 22.2%), mostly via telephone or email.. The remainder included referral to PAU (676; 9.4%), and requests to expedite a pre-existing referral (190; 2.7%) (figure 2). Twenty-eight percent (2034) of all referrals via PDM were managed with advice only. A further 814 (11.4%) were diverted towards a more appropriate service including hospital or community-based allied healthcare professionals (e.g. physiotherapy) or another hospital specialty. Just over half  Abdominal pain was the most common presenting complaint in this patient cohort constituting 414 referrals. The majority of these (278; 67,1%) were allocated to a routine clinic appointment however 44 (10.6%) were given advice and 69 (16.7%) were offered an urgent or soon clinic. Referrals for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and lymphadenopathy were managed with advice only in almost half of cases. Patients referred with confirmed or suspected seizures were most commonly offered an urgent or soon clinic appointment. For six of the top ten presenting complaints, at least 25% of referrals were managed remotely (figure 4). Invitations to complete an online survey regarding usage and feedback on the PDM service were sent to all local GP practices six months into the pilot and the email auto-reply contained a survey link.  To evaluate patient experience, a three-question questionnaire was sent via letter and pre-paid envelope to 474 families managed via the Demand Management pathway in the first six months. We received 30 responses (6% response rate) and no reminders were sent. Twenty-three (77%) expressed satisfaction with the service; 2 were somewhat satisfied; and 5 not satisfied.

However, our cost analysis shows that this investment has been far outweighed by the savings received by CCGs. The response rate from our patient survey was poor in comparison with other studies. [12, 14] This may reflect differences in methodology; our families were contacted retrospectively by letter on a single occasion. Following success of the two-year pilot, the PDM service is now permanently embedded in our department. Keys to its success included having a consultant solely dedicated to the role during office hours, good knowledge of available pathways and connecting services, and flexibility in management options. Opportunities for developing this further include establishing partnerships between paediatricians and General Practice clusters, to improve the quality of community-based management, and enable earlier intervention to avoid future referrals in some cases. This has been successfully implemented as part of the connecting care for children model in North West London, [12] boosting confidence in and usage of GP services by parents.

Inclusion of paediatric trainees, who spend a disproportionate amount of time in acute services,[15] would also enhance understanding of referral processes and develop capabilities in triage. ► Our new consultant-led triage service facilitated successful management of 364 (54%) patients referred for same-day attendance with advice or rapid access clinic appointment. ► Providing direct access to the paediatric demand management consultant during office hours led to the management of 27% of all outpatient referrals without face-to-face contact. ► Primary care feedback on this new integrated pathway was overwhelmingly positive. professionals. We proposed that this new service would facilitate supported management of a significant number of paediatric hospital referrals in primary care. This review presents an evaluation of our PDM service. The Royal United Hospital (RUH) is an average-sized district general hospital providing secondary paediatric care to a population of approximately 80 000 children. Inpatient services comprise a 33-bed children's ward and a paediatric assessment unit (PAU), open from 08:00 to 20:00 daily. The majority of inpatients are admitted from PAU aside from overnight admissions or direct admissions to the ward where an overnight stay is anticipated. PAU admissions are predominantly referred by primary healthcare professionals (mostly general practitioners (GPs)). Other sources of referrals include the emergency department (ED) and a small number of self-referrals of patients with long-term health conditions. Prior to the introduction of the PDM service, children were referred to PAU via the on-call middle grade doctor with very few diverted or avoided. Outpatient paediatric referrals were communicated by letter, fax or electronic referral system, without any prior discussion with the paediatric team. The triage consultant was also the consultant on acute service with no dedicated time to invest in alternative referral management (figure 1). The PDM service was initiated as a 2-year pilot project in January 2017, following approval and financial support from BaNES and Wiltshire clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). Individual elements constituting PDM were chosen based on RCPCH recommendations 4 5 and perceived success in other UK paediatric departments. Some of these were trialled previously by the department (consultant mobile and ad hoc clinics) but deemed unsuccessful due to the lack of dedicated consultant availability for the additional responsibilities. A locum consultant was therefore appointed in January 2017, enabling one general paediatric consultant to be allocated to the PDM service each weekday. This role was rotated through six consultants, with two covering the majority of the rota. The PDM consultant's daily responsibilities included the following: ► Telephone advice and guidance to primary care healthcare practitioners, ED, paramedics, RUH consultants, and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services psychiatrists via a dedicated consultant mobile (09:00 to 17:00). ► Providing advice and guidance via a dedicated email address, including reviewing photographs, ECGs and videos. ► Daily rapid access clinics including same-day appointments. ► Active triage of all outpatient paediatric referrals, supporting management of patients in primary care if appropriate. Referral pathways and outcomes before and after implementation of PDM are outlined in figure 1. The PAU middle grade doctor continued to receive the majority of same-day admission referrals but could redirect these to the PDM consultant where admission avoidance was anticipated. Discussion of acute referrals was also extended to paramedics after implementation. We performed a mixed-methods service evaluation of all patients referred and triaged through the PDM service over a 2-year pilot period. Our aim was to review use of the service and describe its impact through referral outcomes, admission and referral avoidance, primary care and patient feedback, and financial analysis. Data for every contact with the PDM service were collected prospectively on a departmental database to enable service evaluation and regular reporting to commissioners. We analysed these data and quantified the following outcomes: ► Method and reasons for contact. Open access ► Referral outcomes. ► Management of 10 most common presenting complaints. ► GP and patient feedback. Patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination plans of our study. Data collated for 7162 patients managed via the PDM service over a 2-year period from January 2017 to January 2019 were reviewed. Electronic outpatient referrals (2254; 31.5%) and telephone calls (2252; 31.4%) were the most used means of contact, followed by outpatient referral letter (1312; 18.3%) and email (1014; 14.2%). A small proportion of referrals (69; 1%) were redirected by the PAU doctor. The most frequent reason for contacting PDM was a routine paediatric outpatient referral (3183; 44.4%). Referrals for an urgent (within 2 weeks) or soon (within 6 weeks) clinic appointment constituted 1520 (21.2%) contacts. A significant proportion of contacts were for advice only (1592; 22.2%), mostly via telephone or email. The remainder included referral to PAU (676; 9.4%) and requests to expedite a pre-existing referral (190; 2.7%) (figure 2). Outcomes of referrals to PDM Twenty-eight per cent (2034) of all referrals via PDM were managed with advice only. A further 814 (11.4%) were diverted towards a more appropriate service, including hospital or community-based allied healthcare professionals (eg, physiotherapy) or another hospital specialty. Just over half (53.8%) of the referrals to PAU were managed alternatively, resulting in admission avoidance in 364 patients. Of those cases, 195 (53.6%) were given advice and 130 (35.7%) were offered a rapid access clinic appointment (figure 3). Year 1 pilot data for GP-referred admissions to PAU demonstrated a 10% reduction compared with a year-on-year increase for the 5 preceding years (average 17% per year). Year 2 demonstrated a slight (2.5%) increase in admissions, but still a significant contrast with the previous trend. Approximately half of the requests for an urgent clinic (583; 49.2%) or soon clinic (159; 47.5%) were accepted; however, 415 (27.3%) were managed without face-to-face contact. The majority of routine clinic referrals (2043; 64.2%) were deemed appropriate, with a small proportion (203; 6.4%) being offered an earlier review (PAU attendance, urgent or soon clinic). The remainder were managed alternatively, 483 (13.8%) with advice or redirecting the issue to their known consultant and 499 (15.7%) signposted to another service. In total, 1285 (27.3%) of all 4703 outpatient referrals were managed without a clinic appointment (figure 3). Abdominal pain was the most common presenting complaint in this patient cohort, constituting 414 referrals. The majority of these (278; 67.1%) were allocated to a routine clinic appointment; however, 44 (10.6%) were given advice and 69 (16.7%) were offered an urgent or soon clinic appointment. Referrals for gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and lymphadenopathy were managed with advice only in almost half of the cases. Patients referred with confirmed or suspected seizures were most commonly offered an urgent or soon clinic appointment. For 6 of the top 10 presenting complaints, at least 25% of referrals were managed remotely ( figure 4) .  Primary care feedback Invitations to complete an online survey regarding usage and feedback on the PDM service were sent to all local GP practices 6 months into the pilot, and the email autoreply contained a survey link. Seventy-six responses from 37 GP practices were received. Respondents reported usage of multiple communication channels: telephone, 54 (71.1%); email, 47 (61.8%); letter, 14 (18.4%); and e-referral, 15 (19.7%). The majority of contacts were managed with advice only (46; 60.5%). In 27 (35.5%) cases, the patient was seen more urgently than expected, whereas in 8 (10.5%) cases they were seen less urgently than expected. Feedback suggested very high satisfaction rates, with 75 (98.7%) respondents stating they were 'quite likely' or 'very likely' to use the telephone and/ or email service again and 71 (96%) reporting satisfaction with the opinion given. The majority (46; 61.4%) of the respondents agreed that their contact with PDM would change how they manage a patient in the future. The 48 free-text responses were overwhelmingly positive (box 1). Consultants rotating through the PDM role similarly reported satisfaction from offering a more flexible, higher quality service, enabling the consultant on acute service to devote his or her time solely to inpatient work and urgent admissions. To evaluate patient experience, a three-question questionnaire was sent via letter and prepaid envelope to 474 families managed via the Demand Management pathway in the first 6 months. We received 30 responses (6% response rate), and no reminders were sent. Twenty-three (77%) expressed satisfaction with the service, two were somewhat satisfied and five were not satisfied. Of those who were not satisfied, comments related to appointment booking issues (2), delay in subsequent investigations (1), being prescribed antibiotics without a consultation (2) and a perceived delay in the process when the child did ultimately need to be seen. These issues were addressed in the following ways: ► Contacting the family directly when antibiotics were to be prescribed or other significant change in expectations. ► Communicating advice and guidance via letter to both GP and family. ► Explaining that if a future appointment became necessary where it was not offered initially, the first contact date would be considered the start of the pathway. The traditional Payment by Results policy, whereby reducing departmental activity would result in reduced income, required the implementation of an alternative financial arrangement with our commissioners. During the pilot phase, the CCGs financed the additional consultant time. We agreed that appointments in the rapid access clinic, and calls placed via the PDM consultant, would be tariff-free. During the 2-year pilot Box 1 Examples of free-text comments from GP user experiences of demand management 'Saves us and patients (and hopefully hospital) a lot of time and improves care. Consultants always really helpful and even do some teaching at the same time with us. This is amazing because we can then cascade this to the other GPs at the practice to influence ongoing care' 'Used the telephone advice line when urgent appointment seemed to go missing. even emailed in a video of a suspected seizure in a patient which was reviewed by two consultants within 24 hrs and outpatient appt/long wait avoided for the patient. I hope this service can continue its been very valuable' 'Excellent service as always-find this so convenient and useful, and definitely results in fewer referrals from me!' 'the email service is very much appreciated. It's a way to communicate in a timely manner, without the interruption of a phone call, it's also a written record which can be copied and pasted directly into the records. Consultants often include their phone number in case further discussion is needed' 'Very responsive, very helpful, and as implied above, the advice has given me confidence to manage similar cases myself in the futurethis easy process helps avoid letters and delays and I'm sure avoids referrals to clinic' 'Really useful service, well designed to fit in with how primary care works. Always quickly responded to and has stopped several referrals on the occasions where I have used it' 'It is very helpful to be able to ask clinical queries and have an expert opinion with the patient and family with us-thank you' 'Excellent service, all I have spoken to have been friendly and very happy to advise. Also well received by parents who appreciate realtime advice, has certainly reduced their anxiety' GP, general practitioner. period, 2651 clinic appointments and 364 PAU admissions were avoided. This produced estimated cost savings to the CCGs of greater than £400 000 per year, excluding the cost of a new consultant. Our service evaluation indicates that PDM has achieved its aim of facilitating the management of a significant number of paediatric referrals without face-to-face contact. This reversed the year-on-year increase in PAU admissions and outpatient clinic appointments, providing significant annual cost savings to the CCGs. The provision of direct advice and guidance has improved accessibility of paediatric consultants to primary care. This has brought compliance with national standards 5 and overwhelmingly positive feedback from GPs, particularly when used with the family still present in the room. This enabled the paediatrician to ascertain additional information first-hand and to communicate advice or management plan directly to the family. Although email advice was sought less frequently, the capacity to share pictures and videos was highly valued and often used as an adjunct to pre-existing referrals. It also allowed time for a more considered response, following a brief literature review, or discussion with a colleague. The benefits of provision of direct advice and guidance to GPs with respect to alleviating paediatric hospital activity have been described in several published studies. [8] [9] [10] The added educational benefit to GPs is highlighted in our feedback. Over half of the referrals to our PAU via this service were avoided, which surpassed initial expectations and relieved pressure on the acute workforce. Our results are comparable with a previous study 7 in which 50% PAU walk-in attendees were deemed suitable for community management. Unplanned same-day hospital attendances can cause significant disruption and anxiety for families and may expose children to unnecessary investigations, inevitable waits for assessment and reviews, and hospitalacquired infections. 9 Empowering GPs to manage cases in the community offers convenience, increased satisfaction and confidence in primary care. [10] [11] [12] Most of the literature on reducing secondary care activity focuses on acute paediatric presentations. However, we also observed a significant impact on outpatient referrals. Just over a quarter were managed without a face-to-face paediatric review, with either advice or diversion to an appropriate service, ensuring that patients see the right person, first time. Those offered a clinic appointment often had investigations or treatment instigated in advance, avoiding delays in diagnosis and unnecessary follow-up appointments. We lacked follow-up data on patient outcomes, including re-presentation rates for those managed without seeing a paediatrician. However, we have not received any feedback suggesting dissatisfaction since ensuring that GPs and families receive a copy of advice and guidance correspondence. Analysis of presenting complaints provides an insight into primary care case-mix and incentive for educating GPs, almost half of whom have had no formal paediatric training. 5 Eight of our top 10 presenting complaints are included in Birmingham Children's Hospital top 20 outpatient paediatric conditions, 13 implying that these are generalisable. Just under half of the PDM referrals for patients with GORD and lymphadenopathy were managed with advice only. GP feedback implies appreciation of the educational value of direct case discussion, informing future practice, and this could be expanded further in the future. Strengths of our review include its large sample size and representation of a 2-year time period, reducing potential confounding factors such as seasonal variation and varying staffing levels. We acknowledge that our data are limited to a service unique to our department whose success is dependent on a significant investment in consultant time. However, our cost analysis shows that this investment has been far outweighed by the savings received by CCGs. The response rate from our patient survey was poor in comparison with other studies. 12 14 This may reflect differences in methodology; our families were contacted retrospectively by letter on a single occasion. Following the success of the 2-year pilot project, the PDM service is now permanently embedded in our department. Keys to its success included having a consultant solely dedicated to the role during office hours, good knowledge of available pathways and connecting services, and flexibility in management options. Opportunities for developing this further include establishing partnerships between paediatricians and general practice clusters to improve the quality of community-based management and enabling earlier intervention to avoid future referrals in some cases. This has been successfully implemented as part of the connecting care for children model in North West London, 12 boosting confidence in and usage of GP services by parents. Virtual joint telephone and video consultations could be trialled in view of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Inclusion of paediatric trainees, who spend a disproportionate amount of time in acute services, 15 would also enhance understanding of referral processes and develop capabilities in triage.@story_separate@Our results demonstrate the impact of re-structuring paediatric services to facilitate active triage and flexible management of paediatric referrals from primary care practitioners across different communication channels.

The aim of this consultant-delivered service is to manage referrals more efficiently by providing active triage of all referrals, daily rapid access clinics and easily accessible advice for primary healthcare professionals. This study presents an evaluation of this service. DESIGN: Mixed-methods service evaluation with analysis of data for every contact with the PDM service over a 2-year period. For each patient, the method of contact, reason for contact, presenting complaint and triage outcome were recorded. Feedback from general practitioners (GPs) and patients was gathered. RESULTS: Data were analysed for 7162 patients. More than a quarter (2034; 28%) of all referrals were managed with advice only. Of the 4703 outpatient clinic referrals, 1285 (27%) were managed without a clinic appointment. More than half (54%) of the requests for paediatric assessment unit (PAU) admission were managed alternatively, typically with advice only or a rapid access clinic appointment. This has reversed the increasing trend of PAU admissions from primary care of preceding years. Financial analysis suggested the avoidance of these clinic appointments, and PAU admissions provided a substantial cost saving. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the PDM service has succeeded in reducing unnecessary hospital attendances by managing patients more effectively and strengthening partnerships with primary care. The service has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from GPs. This service could be replicated in other Trusts and developed in the future to facilitate further management of paediatric cases in a primary care setting."
"Aging is a complex, multifactorial process [1] that leads to loss of function and is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases [1, 2] . Although there is still much debate in the scientific community, proposals have been made to classify aging as a disease in order to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent or delay the onset of age-related illnessess [3] [4] [5] . Increasing frailty with age leads to an increased risk of many diseases. These diseases are commonly referred to as age-related [6] . Many pathogens are more infectious and prevalent in the elderly, [7] [8] [9] [10] and may be referred to as gerophilic (from Greek, géros ""old man"" and philia, ""love""). Some infections, including COVID-19, are not exclusively gerophilic, as younger people may also become infected. However, these individuals have mild symptoms or remain asymptomatic, while the elderly experience substantially more severe symptoms and lethality. The term gerolavic (from Greek, géros ""old man"", and epilavís, ""harmful"") may more appropriately@story_separate@The online resources Our World in Data [16] and The Lancet's Global Burden of Disease [17] provide deep visual insight into the global burden of disease by cause and demographics. In 2017, there were 56 million deaths globally; over two-thirds of these (76%) were in people over 50 years of age. According to the online period life tables put out by the US Social Security Administration [18] , the annual chance of death in 2015 (the probability of dying within one year) for a person over 80 was 5.2%, increasing to 14.8% by the age 89. According to estimates by the US Centers for Disease Control [19] , approximately 5,945,690 individuals older than 65 had symptomatic influenza during the 2017-2018 season, resulting in 3,329,586 medical visits, 540,517 hospitalizations, and 50,903 deaths. Hence, the death rate for those hospitalized with influenza was 9.4% for patients over 65. However, many of the COVID-19 patients over 65 years have one or more comorbities [20] , and it is often difficult February 11, 2020 . The figures are adopted and generated from [12] (http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51). to attribute the cause of death exclusively to the gerolavic coronavirus. Currently, there are no accurate statistics linking smoking status, lifestyle, and behavior to the severity and lethality of COVID-19. Despite this, it is possible that these factors, as well as frailty and comorbidities, play a substantial role. Gerolavic diseases such as COVID-19 may not significantly increase the yearly death rates for each individual age group; however, these diseases substantially accelerate death from multiple conditions, and compress the process to less than two weeks. Comorbidity is also the likely cause of the substantial differences in death rates among different countries due to differences in patient demographics, levels of preparedness, when the epidemic began locally, and reporting [13] . Only the data available from China, where the epidemic has subsided, and the Diamond Princess cruise ship were used for this study. One of the possible causes of the age-associated increases in COVID-19 infection rate, severity, and lethality is immunosenescence. Immunosenescence is a well-known age-related process contributing to the global burden of disease [21] . It is among the major factors underlying the difference between younger and older populations in the response rate to vaccinations and the virulence of infectious diseases [22] [23] [24] . Among the factors contributing to immunosenescence is the chronic involution of the thymus gland with increased age. Indeed, the infection rates of COVID-19, separated by age, are correlated with involution of the thymus [12] . The thymus gland is most active early in life, reaching maximum size within the first year. Its activity then declines with age until an individual reaches 40 to 50, after which there are negligible traces of the thymus remaining, replaced by fibrotic tissue [25] . As a result of thymic involution, the number of naïve T cells exiting the thymus decreases significantly, with substantial declines in older age [26] . Besides thymic involution, there are many other factors driving immunosenescence and the increase in multimorbidity that occurs during aging [22, 27, 28] . Figure 2 illustrates the hypothesised reciprocal relationship between immunosenescence and infectious disease acquisition. In this model, age-associated immunosenescence leads to a reduced ability to resist infection, while infection produces biological damage and loss of homeostasis. This ultimately contributes to accelerated aging and the development of age-related diseases, and further accelerates immunosenescence. In support of this model, infections and other age-related diseases are among the main causes of death in the developed world and in developing countries. Due to the gerolavic nature of COVID-19, the classical preventative measures and treatment strategies used for targeting infectious diseases may not be as effective, and there is a need for alternative geroprotective and senoremediative strategies. There are multiple clinical trials in progress using established medical interventions to treat COVID-19, with the number of studies rapidly increasing [23] . For a list of promising SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 targets and treatment approaches, please refer to the Global Health Drug Discovery Institute's portal dedicated to COVID-19 [29] .  Here we compare the expected benefit of treatments for elderly populations (60 years and older) that are currently in development, including standard preventative strategies such as vaccines and antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2, and the potential added benefit of speculative geroprotective strategies such as rapalogs, NAD+ boosters, senolytics, and stem cell treatment. These additional measures may be used in isolation or as adjuvant therapies to reduce infection risk, symptom severity, or improve vaccine efficacy. Vaccine development is one of the most successful approaches for combating viral diseases globally, and is often regarded as one of the greatest advances in biomedical science and integrated healthcare. Currently, there are around 60 active clinical trials related to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, most of them taking place in China [30] . Broadly speaking, the success of a vaccine partly depends on the similarity of the vaccine strain with the viral pathogenic strain in question. In addition, an individual's immune response must be sufficiently strong to mount a reaction to the vaccine that can later confer protection against the pathogen, should exposure occur. Our current strategy for targeting annual influenza viral outbreaks focuses on effective vaccination based on predictions of strain variants. People >60 years of age with chronic medical conditions, such as type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease, direct immunosuppression from HIV, posttransplant or biologic treatment, pregnant individuals, or those with BMI>40, are believed to be at higher risk for influenza infection due to a weakened immune response [31] . Similarly, vaccines do not provide complete protection in older populations due to agerelated declines in immune function and accumulation of multi-morbidities. Outbreaks can occur in elderly nursing homes even when vaccination rates reach 80-98% uptake [32] . Thus, even when a successful vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 becomes available, a geroprotective agent might be used in combination with the vaccine to boost the immune response. Currently in most countries, the influenza vaccine formulation is determined 6-9 months before the expected outbreak season and the strains are based on the precedent season's viruses. As a result, vaccine efficacy is expected to differ from season to season. Thus, an ongoing additive geroprotective therapy is of high importance [33, 34] and is applicable beyond the current pandemic. While vaccines may be the best preventative strategy for reducing the infection rates, severity, and lethality of COVID-19, the rates to vaccines in the elderly will likely be lower [35] and vaccine potentiation strategies [36] may be explored and evaluated in clinical trials. While chemoprophylaxis is not routinely indicated and is not considered a replacement for vaccination, using influenza as an example, prophylactic treatment prior to symptom onset in high-risk groups or after close contact exposure to the virus is an alternative preventative strategy against viral disease [31] . For influenza, the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are occasionally given prophylactically to high-risk individuals in long-term care facilities during outbreaks [37] . Nevertheless, there is currently no definitive benefit proven for antiviral treatment outside of these specific circumstances, as it comes at a cost and may be associated with side effects; for example, zanamivir can induce bronchospasms in patients with chronic respiratory disease and asthma. Pharmacotherapy for individuals with infection remains the cornerstone of clinical practice. The success of antiviral treatment is condition-specific, ranging from new, direct-acting antiviral drugs that offer a potential cure for hepatitis C [38] ; to the highly active antiretroviral drugs that enable HIV positive individuals the prospect of a healthy life expectancy while on treatment; to antiviral drugs for herpes simplex types 1 and 2 that lead to symptom alleviation but do not eradicate the latent infection; to antivirals for seasonal influenza that are believed to reduce symptom duration, and reduce complications and transmission risk. Other anti-influenza medications licensed for treatment, aside from oseltamivir and zanamivir, consist of an intravenous neuraminidase inhibitor, peravamir, and a novel oral inhibitor of cap-dependent endonuclease, baloxavir. Neuraminidase inhibitors are effective against both influenza A and B, while an additional class of antivirals that are no longer recommended for treatment of influenza due to reduced efficacy, neurological side effects, and widespread resistance, adamantanes (M2 inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine), are only active against influenza A [31] . Although many patients with influenza exhibit minimal clinical improvement upon treatment with these medications, they are currently recommended for treatment of all hospitalised patients, even prior to laboratory confirmation of influenza infection. Evidence shows that the greatest benefit is seen when these drugs are administered 24-30 hours prior to symptom onset, in which case they reduce symptom duration by 0.5-3 days and reduce transmission risk [39] [40] [41] [42] . According to the recent COVID-19 treatment guidelines in China [43] , symptomatic treatment for COVID-19 patients is recommended for mild cases and consists of AGING rest, isolation, adequate hydration, analgesia, and antipyretic medication. Moderate and severe cases (mostly hospitalized) require additional measures, such as careful fluid balance, intravenous antibiotics for superinfections, oxygen supplementation, non-invasive ventilation with or without positive pulmonary pressure, and in some cases intubation and mechanical ventilation. Although the projected global infection rates are variable, we share a common concern that outside of China there may be an insufficient number of beds for hospitalization and ventilation units if the disease spread does not slow down. Even asymptomatic COVID-19 infections can induce lung fibrosis, which may lead to reduced function of the respiratory system. Further, severe cases are often complicated by bacterial infections and pneumonia, leading to fibrosis. Therefore, COVID-19 rehabilitation may include antifibrotic compounds, anti-COPD, and regenerative medicine therapies. There are multiple interventions proposed in the academic literature to remedy age-associated increases in infection rates, severity, and lethality for a variety of infections. For example, regular increased physical activity has been proposed to reduce immunosenescence [44] . Fahy et al. [45] and Horvath [46] have suggested that a combination of the potentially geroprotective compound metformin, recombinant human Growth Hormone (rhGH), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may reverse biological age, as measured using the methylation aging clock, and immunosenescence [45] . Geroprotectors were previously proposed to enhance human radioresistance in extreme conditions [47] . While there is no clinical evidence yet suggesting age reversal or improved immune function in the elderly, efforts are being made to identify new geroprotectors using human data and artificial intelligence [48] [49] [50] . Further, the use of natural compounds that mimic the effects of known geroprotectors is generally recognized as safe [51] . However, attempts have been made to develop criteria for the evaluation of geroprotectors for clinical validation. There are multiple strategies proposed to restore immune function in the elderly [52] , and multiple databases of geroprotectors exist [53, 54] . However, to date the only known geroprotectors backed by promising clinical evidence of improved immune response to viral infection in the elderly, although still limited by a lack of large clinical trials, are sirolimus (rapamycin) and everolimus. These may be used as single agents in combination with other treatments (Figure 3 ).  Sirolimus (rapamycin) is a well-known geroprotector, known to effectively increase lifespan and slow aging in many species, including yeast [55, 56] , Drosophila [57, 58] , C. elegans [59] , and mice [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] . It also delays age-related diseases in humans [65] [66] [67] [68] , and Blagosklonny proposed rapamycin for the prevention of multiple age-related diseases in humans [69] [70] [71] [72] . Sirolimus and rapalogs are commonly used as immunosuppressants. Rapalogs, the derivatives and mimetics of rapamycin, target critical factors in the rapamycin (TOR) pathway. Everolimus (RAD001), another close structural derivative of sirolimus developed by Novartis, acts as an immunosuppressant; but like sirolimus, it has many other properties beyond immunosuppression [73] . Paradoxically, these compounds also exert immunostimulatory effects, such as boosting T cell responses in reaction to pathogen infection and vaccination [74] . Nevertheless, this would not be the first case of a physiological paradox in clinical medicine. The administration of beta-blockers to heart failure patients at first seemed contradictory, as these compounds slow down an already failing heart, but proved to provide the most benefit for the treatment of heart failure patients. Likewise, hormonal treatment of hormone-dependent cancers, such as testosteronedependent prostate cancer, seems incongruous. However, administration of a synthetic version of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in a different dosing regime from the cyclical secretion that occurs physiologically, which normally indirectly increases testosterone levels, actually reduces hormone levels. Therefore, it might be possible that a drug that is known to be an immunosuppressant might in a different dosing regimen prove to be an immunostimulant. However, extremely cautious clinical validation is required as this treatment might carry significant risks; indeed, there is some indication that morbidity from coronavirus infections occurs from secondary overactive immune responses [75, 76] . In addition to rapamycin, other agents that inhibit mTOR, such as Torin1, Torin2, AZD8055, PP242, KU-006379 and GSK1059615, may act similarly to rapamycin in low-doses and may have a geroprotective effect [77] [78] [79] . Substantial pre-clinical validation would be required to apply these compounds to specific age-associated diseases and to explore clinical applications of these compounds in human clinical trials. Multiple clinical observations suggested that patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease who were treated with rapamycin demonstrated better outcomes and were better able to control CMV viremia than patients treated with standard calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression following transplantation [74, 80] . In 2009, two seminal studies of sirolimus demonstrated the immunostimulatory effects of rapamycin on the CD8+ memory T cell response following pathogen infection [74, 80] . Later studies also showed that monkeys treated with sirolimus exhibited increased recall responses and enhanced differentiation of memory T cells following vaccination with Modified Vaccinia Ankara [81] . Additional clinical studies by Mannick et al. [82, 83] demonstrated the immunostimulatory role of rapalogs in the elderly using the Novartis rapalog everolimus (RAD001), a close structural analog of sirolimus (rapamycin). Administration of everolimus ameliorated immunosenescence in healthy elderly volunteers and enhanced the response to the influenza vaccine by around 20% at doses that were well tolerated [82] . Further studies demonstrated enhanced immune function and reduced infection in elderly patients receiving tolerable doses of everolimus. Mannick et al. also conducted a phase 2a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial which demonstrated that a low-dose combination of dactolisib (BEZ235) and everolimus in an elderly population was safe and associated with a significant (P=0.001) decrease in the rate of reported infections [83] . Mannick and colleagues further conducted a phase 2a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that demonstrated that a low-dose combination of dactolisib (BEZ235), a PI3K inhibitor [84] and catalytic mTOR inhibitor, and everolimus in an elderly population was safe and associated with a significant (P=0.001) decrease in the rate of reported infections [83] . A follow-up trial of dactolisib alone (BEZ235 rebranded as RTB101) for prevention of respiratory tract infections in the elderly did not meet the primary endpoint and further trials were withdrawn [85] . In prior studies, everolimus (RAD001) was used as a standalone agent or in combination with dactolisib, which may explain the phase 3 failure of BEZ235/RTB101. There are over 95 phase 3 and phase 4 studies for these agents [86] , and they are generally well tolerated even in high doses. Even though it may not be commercially viable due to the patent expirations, clinical trials should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these agents for protection against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and other gerophilic and gerolavic infections. Metformin is a drug approved to treat type 2 diabetes but appears to target a number of aging-related mechanisms, including decreasing IGF-1 levels, inhibiting mTOR, and inhibiting mitochondrial complex 1. Metformin is currently in the first large-scale human AGING clinical trial of aging, the Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) study, which is investigating its effect on time to a new occurrence of a composite outcome that includes cardiovascular events, cancer, dementia, and mortality [87] . Metformin would likely still be contraindicated in elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and eGFR<15. A reduced dose would potentially be required for eGFR<30 due to a risk of lactic acidosis. The effects on gerophilic and gerolavic infections should be carefully examined in the context of the TAME study, and other clinical trials involving metformin. Nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a cofactor of multiple fundamental enzymes. It is involved in metabolic regulation through the Krebs (citric acid) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and cellular signaling, as well as cellular senescence and DNA repair through the poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), sirtuins, and CD38. NAD levels decrease with aging, and benefits of NAD supplementation have been reported in multiple animal studies. Although no proof of a similar effect in humans has been shown, several clinical trials are in progress [88] [89] [90] [91] . Supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (NR) in one human study produced an improvement in exercise capacity in a population with a mean age of 71 [92] . This compound was also shown to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients [93] . Nicotinic acid is another NAD precursor that is converted in the body to NAD by the enzymes NAPRT, NMNAT, and NADS. Large-scale trials of nicotinic acid for cardiovascular disease [94, 95] showed some efficacy, but produced adverse side effects, such as headache, skin flushing, and dizziness [96] . NAD acts at a cellular level and it is still unclear whether oral or intravenous supplementation with NAD donors, such as NR and nicotinic acid, will increase NAD levels and exert a clinical benefit in humans. However, COVID-19 patients may benefit tremendously from these compounds, as SARS-CoV-2infected patients have increased levels of CD38+, and NAD has been shown to enhance DNA repair via PARP pathways [97] . Caution should be exercised when conducting any clinical trials for NAD boosters against gerophilic and gerolavic infections, as the underlying biology of NAS metabolism and viral infections is still poorly understood. Recent studies in humans demonstrate that NR supplementation reduces the levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines [98] , while Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) may reduce the expression of these cytokines [99] . Other studies implicate NAD in increased cytokine production [100] and the NAD+consuming enzyme CD38 in increased inflammation [101] . Additional immunological studies of NAD boosters must be performed before clinical trials may be conducted. However, considering the large consumer base of NR and NMN supplements, it may be possible to conduct metastudies on influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, severity, and lethality. Senolytics are drugs that are postulated to selectively destroy senescent cells, which accumulate with aging and exhibit senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), through senolysis, apoptosis, immunosurveillance, or other mechanisms of action [102] . SASP is now hypothesised to lead to NAD depletion and thus initiate or perpetuate an increase in sterile chronic inflammation. Many drug classes, ranging from fibrates to cardiac glycosides, have been reported to have senolytic properties in animal models [103] . However, recent promising human data have been reported with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib in combination with the plant flavonol quercetin in a trial by the Mayo Clinic [104] ; flavonoid polyphenols have also proven beneficial. In addition, pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that flavonoids may be used for prophylaxis in upper respiratory tract infections [105] . Although senolytic drugs would have a scientifically plausible role in biological age reversal and thus reduction of mortality from gerolavic viruses like SARS-CoV-2, it has not been shown that these classes of drugs would protect against infection or could be used as adjuncts to vaccination. In addition, there remains the risk that senolytics would not be sufficiently specific to discriminate between deleterious senescent cells and quiescent (dormant) cells, which might still differentiate into the mature cell types of a given tissue, and could thus deplete beneficial protective stem cell reserves. It has been shown in multiple studies that calorie restriction leads to increased lifespan and improved cardiometabolic markers, even when initiated in middle age [106] . Caloric restriction should be considered as a preventive measure on a long-term basis and is indicated for younger individuals. Some elderly patients already have frailty syndromes and evident sarcopenia/ osteopenia, which limits the suitability of intermittent caloric restriction. Nevertheless, the AGING benefits of time-restricted feeding and intermittent fasting go beyond simple caloric restriction due to the production of ketones. Ketones are active signaling molecules that play a major role in the PPAR, sirtuin, NAD and CD38 pathways, encourage autophagy (the removal of damaged cellular materials), modulate the immune response, and have been explored in clinical trials as an adjuvant therapy for cancer treatments [107] . Within 8-12 hours of food restriction, ketones are believed to rise to 0.2 to 0.5mM and continue to increase within the first 48 hours to 1 to 2mM [108] . Under fasting conditions the major body ketone in the plasma, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), increases. BHB is believed to confer the major metabolic benefit of fasting and is in development as an independent therapeutic supplement. An age-related decrease of thymic function consequently reduces the levels of specific T cell subsets [109] . FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical in homeostasis of the immune system and are believed to start declining in numbers at around 50-60 years of age; this remains one of the fundamental drivers of immunosenescence. There are two known origins for Treg cells: thymus-derived Treg cells and peripherally-derived Treg (pTreg) cells. Thus, inducing a peripheral Treg response in older individuals might be a feasible strategy for increasing Treg cell levels until we have more plausible options for thymic rejuvenation. FOXP3 transcription factor (TF) is the most important regulator of Tregs and ageassociated immunosenescence. FOXP3 TF expression is regulated by chemical modification by sirtuin (sirt) and histone deacetylases, in particular Sirt1 and HDAC9 [110, 111] . Interestingly, NAD is essential for sirtuin action. Therefore, it is plausible that NAD and NAD-related compounds such as NR and NMN, which are under investigation as therapeutic interventions that increase serum and cellular NAD levels, also act via Sirt1 along the FOXP3 and Treg axis, and play a role in immunosenescence and ""inflammaging"". A brief summary of the conventional and geroprotective and senoremediative strategies for patients 60 or older is provided in Table 1 . While there are decades of clinical evidence supporting the use of rapalogs, such as sirolimus, everolimus, and metformin, substantial meta-analysis and additional clinical trials must be conducted to understand the population-level and individual effects of these drugs taken as single agents and in combination in the context of gerolavic diseases. In this paper I propose conducting clinical trials on these known geroprotectors as a preventative measure before patients are exposed to disease (Figure 4 ). In the case of COVID-19 as the number of cases worldwide increases, meta-analysis of infection rates, severity, and lethality should be performed rapidly to evaluate the effects of geroprotectors, with particular focus on rapamycin. Since COVID-19 engages the immune system to damage the lungs, it may be entirely plausible that the immunomodulatory properties of rapamycin may go beyond prevention and may provide an effective treatment option. However, this hypothesis must be validated using meta-analysis before being proposed for a clinical trial. As COVID-19 causes substantial lung damage, antifibrotics, senolytics and other geroprotectors may be explored in clinical trials to assist in patient recovery to prevent a reduction in respiratory function. Since senescence varies among individuals, a person's chronological age is not as important as their biological age. For several years, scientists have sought accurate aging biomarkers that may predict an individuals' biological age and, independently of immunosenescence, their risk of morbidity and mortality. These biomarkers, or ""clocks"", could then be used to test for the effectiveness of proposed geroprotective treatments and as surrogate markers in anti-aging clinical trials. While there are no reliable aging clocks to evaluate immunosenescence and inflamaging [112] , these biomarkers may be rapidly developed using historical data. At present, age clocks trained on clinical blood tests [113] , transcriptomic [114] and proteomic data [115] , methylation clocks [46, 116] , microbiomic clocks [117] and other clocks have been described. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the development of multimodal multi-omics age-predictors, able to learn complex non-linear patterns and extract the most important features [113, 118] . None of these currently have robust clinical validation and cannot yet serve as companion biomarkers for geroprotective and antiaging interventions intended to ameliorate the population-level effects of infectious diseases during flu seasons and pandemics. We call for rigorous clinical validation and further development of biological aging clocks that could, in the future, allow us to measure the effectiveness of the numerous speculative geroprotective and senoremediative interventions described herein. COVID-19 is a gerolavic infection. Efficacy of the vaccine will likely be significantly reduced due to immunosenescence and multimorbidity. Possible immunogenicity and mild viral prodrome symptoms as a result of vaccination. Antibodies for COVID-19 Antibodies of serum of recovered individuals. Antibodies targeting specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Successfully trialed in other viral diseases including Ebola. Reduction in disease severity and lethality in exposed individuals. Risk of systemic immune reactions and certain blood borne infections. Selective small molecule inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as 3C-like protease. Multiple examples from Influenza. Neuraminidase and endonuclease inhibitors. Reduction in disease duration, severity, and lethality in exposed individuals. Mild side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibacterials, pain management. Multiple clinical trials, common use. Reduction in severity of disease. Mild side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. [24] . Theoretically, treatments found to be effective against SARS and MERS are the most promising starting points for treatments likely to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. The SARS outbreak of 2002 was rapidly contained, and no new cases have been reported since 2004 [119] . Since the scale of the outbreak did not provide any commercial benefit for the pharmaceutical industry to develop effective drugs for SARS, much of the discovery efforts stopped after the epidemic. When the news of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 emerged in early January 2020, it was difficult to justify a business case for small biotechnology companies to allocate resources to the effort. By January 28 th , however, Insilico Medicine allocated resources to generate and test small molecules against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease [120, 121] . As the scale of the current COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, it is still difficult to justify allocating scarce company resources to full-scale drug discovery and drug development programs, which may cost tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars [122] . Multiple biotechnology companies are in the same situation and will not be able to proceed without substantial backing from government agencies, nonprofit organizations, or bigger pharmaceutical companies. However, given the gerophilic and gerolavic nature of COVID-19, strategies targeting age-associated pathologies and immunosenescence, which could decrease the comorbidity, infection rates, severity, and lethality of the disease, will remain commercially-viable even when the pandemic subsides. In addition, respiratory infections are now the third leading cause of death in the world, following cardiac disease and stroke [123] , further justifying the need for these interventions. Considering the gerolavic nature of COVID-19, where the majority of the seriously affected population is older than 60, classical prevention and treatment strategies may not be effective. Given the severity and lethality of the pandemic, even healthcare systems in developed countries will find it challenging to cope with the increased disease burden and hospital needs. Conventional approaches to prevention such as vaccines are much needed, but even these do not offer complete protection in the elderly due to multi-morbidity and agerelated immune declines. Therefore, interventions that enable immunocompromised elderly to mount an immune response to newly developed vaccines are necessary to help eradicate the disease and reduce the associated mortality. To avoid substantial loss of life and quality of life, primarily among the elderly and vulnerable populations, governments and healthcare systems should investigate preventative and intervention strategies stemming from recent advances in aging research. As discussed in this paper, small clinical studies have shown that several geroprotective and senoremediative interventions, such as treatment with AGING sirolimus and rapalogs, can induce immunopotentiation, increase resistance to infection, and reduce disease severity in the elderly, without severe side effects. Serendipitously, during the revision of this article, another group utilizing computational approaches proposed using melatonin and sirolimus (rapamycin) in combination to treat the COVID-19 infection outside the context of geroprotection [124] . Many of these predicted geroprotectors are available as supplements; however, no meta-analysis or metaclinical trials have been performed at scale to evaluate their effectiveness. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the paucity of clinical trials on the effects of dietary supplements and drugs on aging and immunosenescence. The existence of pseudoscience and anecdotal promotion in the supplement industry does not mean that protective compounds do not exist. Dietary supplement vendors and pharmaceutical companies need to actively engage in preclinical and clinical research to evaluate the effectiveness of the currently available products on immunosenescence and aging. This perspective is of a highly speculative nature presented during the time of a global COVID-19 pandemic. It is intended for a professional audience to stimulate ideas and aid the global efforts of the scientific community to develop effective new treatments for this disease. This article does not represent medical advice or recommendations to patients. There is no clinical evidence to support the use of the treatments described in this article for this indication and the authors do not advise anyone to self-administer these drugs as COVID-19 prevention or treatment. Furthermore, this perspective is based on the limited data from the first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak. The demographic distribution of the infected and diseased may change and differ in different countries with different social customs and different ethnicities. The media should exercise caution and seek expert medical advice for interpretation when referring to this article to avoid misinterpretation or unsafe messages being delivered to the community amidst exceptional coverage of this disease in the media at present.

It may be possible that some of the potential geroprotectors described in this paper are harmful to the elderly after infection, and may actually increase disease severity and lethality. However, it may be possible to conduct clinical trials on the efficacy of geroprotectors previously tested in human clinical trials in treating COVID-19 and other gerophilic and gerolavic infections. To combat the growing COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have united globally to tackle a disease that is impacting lives and healthcare systems around the world. After carefully analysing preliminary data, we suggest that COVID-19 has a gerophilic and gerolavic profile, being more infectious and more severe in the elderly. In this paper, we review the current literature on speculative aging reversal treatments, such as experimental geroprotective strategies using everolimus (RAD001) and sirolimus (rapamycin). We summarize the current possible interventions and identify the lack of clinical evidence to support their immediate use with the aim of encouraging further, more rigorous reviews of geroprotective compounds such as rapalogs, metformin, senolytics, and conventional and investigational NAD+ boosters. We also suggest that further clinical studies should be carefully designed and adequately powered to determine if these interventions might provide clinical benefit as adjuncts to vaccines and antiviral treatments by acting as immune response potentiators. Lastly, as with many other diseases, COVID-19 is more common and severe in elderly populations, and we thus invite further research and clinical validation in the field of biological aging clocks. These markers could potentially be used in the future to measure and analyze immunosenescence and the efficacy of interventions claimed to slow down or reverse age-related immune decline.","The recently identified SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the age-associated vulnerability in the burden of disease and put aging research in the spotlight. The limited data available indicates that COVID-19 should be referred to as a gerolavic (from Greek, géros “old man” and epilavís, “harmful”) infection because the infection rates, severity, and lethality are substantially higher in the population aged 60 and older. This is primarily due to comorbidity but may be partially due to immunosenescence, decreased immune function in the elderly, and general loss of function, fitness, and increased frailty associated with aging. Immunosenescence is a major factor affecting vaccination response, as well as the severity and lethality of infectious diseases. While vaccination reduces infection rates, and therapeutic interventions reduce the severity and lethality of infections, these interventions have limitations. Previous studies showed that postulated geroprotectors, such as sirolimus (rapamycin) and its close derivative rapalog everolimus (RAD001), decreased infection rates in a small sample of elderly patients. This article presents a review of the limited literature available on geroprotective and senoremediative interventions that may be investigated to decrease the disease burden of gerolavic infections. This article also highlights a need for rigorous clinical validation of deep aging clocks as surrogate markers of biological age. These could be used to assess the need for, and efficacy of, geroprotective and senoremediative interventions and provide better protection for elderly populations from gerolavic infections. This article does not represent medical advice and the medications described are not yet licensed or recommended as immune system boosters, as they have not undergone clinical evaluation for this purpose."
"The gut microbiome is virtually an organ of the human body. The gut is colonized with 10 13 of microbes belonging to thousands of species. Alterations of microbiome composition are linked to lifestyle changes, short-and long-term diet [1] , probiotics intake [1, 2] , medications including antibiotics [3] and diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes [4] , colorectal cancer [5] , Crohn's disease [6] and others. Based on the discovered associations, a number of microbial taxa have been proposed as potential biomarkers. For example, the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucin-degrading bacterium is inversely associated with body fat mass and glucose intolerance [7] . Disrupted gut community structure is also one of the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases [8] . Many of the bacteria belonging to Clostridiales order are efficient producers of butyrate an other short-chain fatty acids known to possess anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and other important activities including gut epithelium integrity maintainence [9, 10] . The task of typing and enumerating gut microbial taxa is highly important. There are a plethora of methods for addressing it, including cultivation-based methods, PCR approaches and high-thoughput sequencing. Despite the recent progress with culturomics [11] , routine stool cultivation allows to enumerate a narrow range of gut microbes with low accuracy. The methods based on microbiome sequencing are becoming more popular -the ""shotgun"" metagenomics as well as amplicon-based surveys (using 16S rRNA gene for prokaryotes and ITS region for yeast, etc.). Unlike the culture-dependent approaches, the sequencing gives a total semiquantitative portrait of the microbiomecapturing the uncultivable diversity as well. An alternative method for taxonomic and functional profiling of microbial communities are hybridization microarrays that allow highthroughput detection of thousands of targets at a time including prokaryotes, viruses, yeast and protozoa [12] [13] [14] . Although microarrays capture low-abundant microbes and can be cost-efficient on a large scale, they only detect a fixed set of microbial targets and require a specialized microarray analysis instrument. Another category for microbiome profiling methods is based on PCR using oligonucleotide sequences specific to selected microbial clades. The real-time PCR (qPCR) is superior to the above-mentioned methods in terms of generally available equipment, cheaper sample preparation, flexibility in application and robustness for diagnostic applications. Human gut-specific PCR panels have been described before. One of them describes a qPCR test for detecting 4 taxa using SYBR Green: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Enterococcus spp. [15] . In a more extensive manner, a real-time quantitative PCRbased analysis platform termed 'GUt Low-Density Array' (GULDA) with SYBR Green for 27 bacterial taxa was introduced [16] . Detailed cladefocused applications are available -for example, for detecting all known species of human gut-dwelling bifidobacteria [17] using genus-and species-specific primers and probes for qPCR and further proceeding with PCR product restriction for species identification. In this article we describe a qPCR-based platform for taxonomic profiling of gut microbiome targeting taxa that are prevalent in the gut and/or associated with important diseases, diet, populations, age and other factors. The platform provides a flexible tool for analyzing an individual microbiome composition (e.g., from a stool sample) to assess its general deviation from the reference population distributions, as well as quantify potential microbial biomarkers of disbyosis -universal as well as disease-specific.@story_separate@The target taxa were selected based on the principles of combining the taxa differentially abundant in subjects with major diseases (obesity, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] and atherosclerosis), the taxa enriched in probiotic representatives and the ""driver"" taxa of the human gut microbiome. We collected a statistical summary of the targets' abundance in the 16S rRNA datasets of stool samples collected from the Russian general population during the OhMyGut crowdfunded project [1] and other studies (see Supplementary Table 2 ). The HITdb v1.00 database was used as a non-redundant curated set of 16S rRNA genes specific for human gut microbiota [18] . In order to identify primers and probes targeting specific groups of gut microbes, the gene sequences were analyzed to identify the regions that were both highly conservative within a given group and sufficiently variable to separate the group from other members of the gut microbiome. On the first step, nucleotide sequences belonging to a certain taxon were extracted from the database and aligned using the Aligner tool [19] . The obtained alignment was then used to define regions conservative within a given taxon. For this, we split the alignment into overlapping 20-mer blocks (set of columns) and only highly conservative blocks (showing 90% agreement in the consensus sequence with < 3 degenerate positions) were selected. On the next step, we checked the taxon-specificity of each conservative block. For this, a BLAST database was constructed using all the sequences from HITdb except those for the analyzed taxon. A conservative block was considered taxon-specific if, during a search against the BLAST database, it had aligned to < 1% of non-specific targets with 100% identity and coverage. In case when no such taxonspecific conservative blocks were identified, all the blocks were combined into pairs of blocks separated from each other by 50-300 bases (typical qPCR fragment size). A pair of blocks was considered taxonspecific if the blocks had not aligned to the same non-specific target simultaneously. Stool DNA was extracted as described previously [1] . For facilitating PCR amplification, additional purification from PCR inhibitors was performed using AmpliPrime DNK-Sorb-B (Federal State Institution Central Research Institute of Epidemiology of Rospotrebnadzor, Russia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 1200-1400 bp fragment of 16S rDNA was amplified as follows. The master mix in a reaction volume of 50 μL included: 1x Taq polymerase buffer (65 mM Tris-НCl [pH 8.9]); 16 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 ; 0.05% Tween 20; 3.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM dNTPs, 50 ng genomic bacterial DNA or DNA isolated from human feces, 0.3 μM solutions of oligonucleotide primers, 1U Taq-polymerase (Biosan), 0.5U Pfu-polymerase (Biosan). Amplification was performed in Tercyc thermal cycler (DNK-Tehnologiya) under the following program: 15 min at 95°C for initial denaturation, 30 cycles of 10 s at 95°C for denaturation, 10 s at 60°C for annealing, 60 s at 72°C for elongation. The amplification products were hydrolyzed using the respective restriction endonucleases (SibEnzyme) and ligated using pBluscriptII SK(+) vector hydrolyzed with the same endonucleases within 3 h with 100U T4 DNA ligases (Biosan). Competent cells of E. coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) were transformed with a ligase mixture. In the plasmid clones selected according to the results of specific PCR, the nucleotide sequence of the insert was determined by Sanger sequencing for confirmation. Plasmid DNA was extracted from 100 mL of overnight culture on LB medium using QIAGEN Plasmid Midi Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrations of the obtained reference plasmid DNA were measured by spectrophotometry and fluorometry (Qubit BR kit, Invitrogen). Two μg DNA was hydrolyzed by restriction endonuclease SalGI for linearization. The obtained linear standards were diluted to a concentration of 10 7 to 10 0 copies of plasmid DNA per μL in a sterile buffer containing 10 mM TrisHCl pH 7.6 and poly-A RNA (5 ng per μL). DNA concentration in the obtained standards was measured using digital PCR on a QX100 Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad) platform according to the manufacturer's instructions. For this purpose, 20 μL PCR mixture containing the analyzed DNA (< 66 ng per 20 μL), 1X PCR mixture (Bio-Rad), 300 nM oligonucleotide primers and 100 nM TaqMan probe were prepared. To obtain microdroplets, 20 μl of the prepared PCR mixture and 70 μl of oil to generate drops were placed in open DG8 cartridges. 40 μL of the obtained microdroplets was transferred to a 96-well PCR plate, sealed with foil and placed in a thermal cycler. Amplification program: 96°C-10 min then 50 cycles were performed as follows: 96°C-30 s, 57°C-60 s with final warming for 10 min at 98°C. Then the microdroplets were read and analyzed using a Droplet Reader instrument; the obtained data were processed in the QuantaSoft program (Bio-Rad). Quantitative qPCR was carried out using a CFX96 thermal cycler (BioRad) in 96-well PCR plate (PCR-96M2-HS-C; Axygen). Sequences of primers and TaqMan probes are provided in Supplementary Tables 2  and 3 . Amplification for each sample was carried out in two replicates in a total volume of 20 μL containing: 65 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.9), 16 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 3.0 mM MgCl 2 , 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2 mM dNTPs (BIOSAN LLC), 0.3 μM oligonucleotide primers with 0.1 μM TaqMan probe, 1 U hot start Taq polymerase (ICBFM SB RAS), 2 μL target DNA or plasmid standard. Amplification was carried out according to the following protocol: To quantify the DNA of the target microbial taxa in a sample, the method of calibration curves was used: successive 10-fold dilutions of plasmid standards were obtained and then amplified. The concentration range of calibration standards is shown in Supplementary Table 4 . Gene amplification levels obtained by PCR were recorded as Ct values that are inversely related to the initial DNA concentration. Quantity Mean was calculated automatically by the CFX96 (BioRad) software control program based on the set calibration curve values. After automatic data processing, the inaccuracies of automatic reading for some of the curves were corrected by manual alignment. The quantity values were exported to a spreadsheet for further analysis and comparison of data with the results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The library preparation for stool DNA samples and Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing was performed as described previously [2] targeting V4 region of the gene with the following modification of 515F-806R primers: GTGBCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA and GACTACNVGG-GTMTCTAATCC. Data analysis has been done using Knomics-Biota system [20] . Reads were denoised using DADA2 algorithm [21] with the variable trimming length (from 251 to 253 bp). The taxonomic classification of the denoised reads has been done using QIIME2 naivebayes classifier [22] and GreenGenes database [18] with pre-trimmed and clustered with 97% identity sequences using TaxMan [23] and CD-HIT software (version 4.8.1) [24] . The relative abundance of each taxon was calculated by rarefying to 3000 reads per sample and normalizing to 100%. Proportions of genera and families were obtained by summing the levels of their member amplicon-sequencing variants (ASV). The qPCR and 16S rRNA values for target taxa abundance were compared using Spearman's correlation. Multiple comparison adjustment has been done using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. During PERMANOVA analysis, abundance values of PCR targets were used as predictors and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix calculated from 16S rRNA composition -as output. The developed qPCR platform allows semiquantitative detection of major gut microbial taxa using qPCR with oligonucleotide probes. It provides an efficient way to characterize the major components of the human gut microbiome in relation to diseases, dietary interventions as well as for comparison with other factors. The platform includes specific oligonucleotide probes for detection and quantification of the microbes listed in Table 1 . The final list included 12 taxa shown in Table 1 . The number of taxa was selected to balance the scope of detection with the economical expenses due to the probe design and analysis cost. Following the in silico analysis described in the Materials and Methods, the consensus sequences were derived from taxon-specific conservative blocks (or pairs of blocks). Primers and probes were designed based on the consensus sequences using Vector NTI software [54] . The following requirements had to be fulfilled: melting temperature (T m ) -58-62°C for a primer and 65-75°C for a probe, GC content -40-65%, no hairpins with the ΔG < -3 kcal/mol and > 2 kcal/mol, no primer-dimers with the ΔG < −5 kcal/mol. The 12 pairs of primers and probes selected in this way are specific to the investigated taxa. The qPCR-based platform contains a pair of primers and an oligonucleotide probe for each taxon. The platform characteristics were calculated based on the amplification of consecutive 10-fold dilutions of plasmid standards. An example of amplification for one of the primer sets is shown in Fig. 1 . All primer sets worked in the efficiency range of 81-128.9%, the coefficient of determination was high (R 2 > 0.979) confirming high reproducibility of the results. Detailed analytical characteristics are listed in Supplementary Table 5 . Due to multitude of targeted taxa, the specificity of the qPCR platform was evaluated via comparison with the results of high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing. For validation of the qPCR platform, we selected 42 stool samples from generally healthy Russian population that, according to previously performed 16S rRNA sequencing, were representative of global gut microbiome diversity and contained widely varying proportions of the target taxa of the qPCR platform. Each of the stool DNA samples were amplified using each of the primer pairs and probes (listed in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ). In each qPCR run, the analysis was performed for each taxon on all samples accompanied with negative control and a series of positive controls. The positive controls were plasmids in 4 dilutions each used to assess PCR efficacy (concentrations are shown in Supplementary Table 4 ). Two repeats were performed for each qPCR experiment to obtain more precise results. Standard curve was drawn by plotting the logarithmic input DNA concentration vs. mean cycle threshold (mCt). Overall, the differences between the replicates for stool samples were significantly lower than between samples (delta Ct 0.54 ± 0.29 vs. 5.31 ± 4.63, p = 0; see Supplementary Fig. S1 ). In case if the discrepancy between the two replicates is more than 1 cycle it is recommended that the experiment should be repeated and the outlying replicate be removed. The same stool DNA samples were also subject to 16S rRNA library preparation (V4 region) and sequencing. The taxonomic classification of each read was used to obtain the total composition of each sample and the relative abundance of each identified taxon. Overall, when the abundance values across all taxa and samples were pooled, the correlation between the qPCR and 16S rRNA sequencing was significant (Spearman's r = 0.66, p = 0). For 11 of the 12 target taxa, their levels were significantly correlated between the two methods (FDR-adjusted p < 0.05) (see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7; per-sample comparison is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The remaining taxon [Ruminococcus] produced insignificant correlation (r = 0.03, FDR-adjusted p = 0.8414). Fig. 3 shows the percentage of variance in community structure according to NGS explained by the level of each PCR target; totally all targets explain 36.5% of it. Considerable conformance of our qPCR platform with the results of high-throughput sequencing suggests that the panel is a prototype applicable for profiling major components of the human gut microbiome. The analyzed sample types can range from stool samples -as the noninvasive method of choice in such studies -to swabs and biopsies as well as contents of human intestinal tract simulators. Large-scale datasets obtained via the standard described protocol and using the same DNA extraction protocol can be subsequently subject to statistical analysis like the ones used for NGS microbiome data to conduct exploratory I. Kurina, et al. analysis and reveal associations with factors like diseases, diet and lifestyle [20] . The platform was designed in a way to reach equilibrium between the coverage of the human gut microbiome diversity and cost per analysis. Subsequently, as the gut microbiome is highly complex, many prevalent taxa are not currently included among the targets. According to our comparison with NGS results, only a third of the total composition variance is explained by the platform. Our results show that the other families and genera that are abundant and variable across the test samples according to 16S rRNA sequencing but not targeted by the PCR test include Lachnospiraceae spp. (9.2 ± 4.3%), Faecalibacterium (5.9 ± 5.0%) and Ruminococcus (3.4 ± 3.0%). These along with their members are potential candidates to be included in the prospective extended panel -along with various members of the Firmicutes phylum including Dorea, Roseburia and others. However, the taxonomy within the phylum especially its Clostridiales order is rather ambiguous hence further elaboration of the primers and probes will be required. One of the methods for microbiome profiling that can be viewed as an alternative to the proposed panel is Nanopore sequencing. Its advantages includes the possibility to obtain the total microbial composition in an untargeted way. However, although the analysis time (~12 h) takes shorter than for 16S rRNA on Illumina platform, compared to qPCR it takes longer (qPCR: 2-3 h), is less cost-efficient and scalable and requires more expensive equipment [55] . For some of the taxa, we observed a reduced correlation of qPCR levels with the 16S rRNA sequencing results. At least for some of the taxa they could be due to a lower dynamic range provided by NGS (at given coverage) -so that the values below 1 read could be detected only by qPCR. A low correlation for [Ruminococcus] could be due to abovedescribed complexity of Clostridiales phylogeny and need to improve the alignment of taxonomic annotations with the 16S rRNA database. While our method is cultivation-independent and allows to capture a variety of taxa undetected during a classic stool test, its taxonomic detection accuracy is limited by the level of genus. A single genus can include species and strains with a highly variable gene content resulting in dramatically different phenotypes -from probiotic to human pathogen like in the case of Escherichia coli [6] -or correlating to opposing dietary patterns as shown for Prevotella copri [56] . Despite this limitation, a general-level profile of the gut microbiome composition provided by the proposed platform can be useful for assessing the general degree of dysbiosis. It can help in more advanced tasks like predicting response to drug therapy (as suggested by the discovered link between cancer immunotherapy response and Bacteroides levels [57] ) or diet (for example, high-fiber diet [1] ), measuring contribution of gut microbes to microbiome of built environments [58] as well as rapidly assessing the gut microbiome dysbiosis in patients with viral infections like COVID- Table 1 List of the 12 target taxa in the platform.

One of the problems of the PCR approach is related to normalization. To address this issue, the set could be extended by adding a universal pair of primers (and a probe) targeting total prokaryotic content that can be used for normalization purposes (for example, by dividing signals from other taxa by it). Although this would reflect the microbial concentration in the analyzed DNA sample, this concentration could not directly correspond to the concentration in the subject's stool, as it can change considerably during the extraction. One of the suggested ways to approach absolute normalization is to collect an exactly equal volume of stool each time. Still, our platform allows us to assess the pairwise ratios between the targeted taxa. Consideration of ratios in the context of microbiome data is especially relevant as for many techniques -including metagenomics -they are often inherently compositional implying use of statistical approaches based on ratios, for instance, the balances [60] . The ratios and their derivatives can further be used as microbial community features to explore the associations with clinical status, diet and other factors. Finally, the proposed platform can be used for prioritization purposes: basing on its results for a specific subject, one can opt for performing additional in-depth analysis using other qPCR platforms targeting microbial genes (like virulence factors and antibiotic resistance determinants) or pathogenic taxa.

"Postural stability is a complex process of coordination of the body that resists gravity and involves multiple coordination activities such as biomechanics, sensations, and mobility. Postural stability control is a key skill that affects motion performance. Static postural stability positively correlates with age from 2 years of age to 12 years of age. However, after reaching middle age, the standing postural stability becomes inversely correlated with age. Maintaining a good postural stability is a key factor for maintaining a good quality of life while ageing. When abnormalities occur in the vision, the vestibular or somatosensory systems, which controls postural stability and muscle endurance, can help for maintaining good postural stability [1] . Porter et al. [2] highlighted that the muscle endurance of the somatosensory system gradually decreases with age. Chodzko-Zajko et al. [3] indicated that resistance the mean EMG frequency during muscle fatigue, indicating that the HHT-estimated results have less variability and higher stability. This study aims to see if the centre of pressure (COP) measurement on postural stability can be used to represent the electromyography (EMG) measurement of lower limb muscles activity data.

A two-stage procedure was used to analyse the COP and EMG signals. Firstly, the EMD was used to decompose the COP and EMG signals into several IMFs and two IMFs, and similar signal frequencies with COP and EMG were identified. During the second stage, the IMFs obtained from COP and EMG was used for correlation analyses to determine the relationship between postural stability and changes in the lower-limb muscles. The greatest difference between HHT and wavelet transformations is the absence of basic functions. The HHT uses decomposition rules to replace basis functions and EMD is used to decompose signals into summations of IMFs. Subsequently, the Hilbert Transform method is used to obtain meaningful instantaneous frequencies. This is advantageous since it can analyse non-linear and nonsteady-state signals and present the original physical characteristics of the signals.

EMD utilises the characteristic time scales in signals to define the vibrational mode and provide good vibrational mode analyses. A non-zero mean signal can also be used, and the decomposition procedure is termed sifting process [16] [17] [18] , which is as follows: EMD utilises the characteristic time scales in signals to define the vibrational mode and provide good vibrational mode analyses. A non-zero mean signal can also be used, and the decomposition procedure is termed sifting process [16] [17] [18] , which is as follows: Step 1. Identify the local maxima and local minima of the signal X(t) and use cubic splines to define the local maxima as the upper envelope and the local minima as the lower envelope. The mean of the upper and lower envelopes is taken as the mean envelope m 1 (t). Step 2. The mean envelope m 1 (t) is subtracted from the signal X(t) to obtain the component h 1 (t). Step 3. Validate whether h 1 (t) fulfils the IMF conditions. The stopping criterion is that the difference between the number of extreme points and the number of cross-zero points must be less than or equal to one, and the mean envelope must be zero. If the stopping criterion is not fulfilled, return to Step 1 to use h 1 (t) as X(t) for the second sifting process to obtain h 11 (t). Step 4. The excessive screening will result in the loss of original physical characteristics from the results. Therefore, the sifting process must obey the convergence criteria to ensure that the physical characteristics of IMF are maintained. The convergence criteria are that the difference between the number of local extreme points and cross-zero points must be zero and the standard deviation should lie between 0.2 and 0.3. The formula is given as Step 5. After the k sifting processes, if the IMF stopping or convergence criteria are met, then component h 1k (t) can be taken to be the first IMF and is represented by c 1 (t). c 1 (t) as the component with the shortest cycle in X(t). Step 6. c 1 (t) is subtracted from the signal X(t) to obtain the residual function r 1 (t). If r 1 (t) contains other components with longer cycles, then Steps 1-5 are repeated for r 1 (t) until n number of IMFs are selected. . . . r n−1 (t) − c n (t) = r n (t) Step 7. When IMFs with physical characteristics cannot be obtained from the residual function r n (t), the sifting process is stopped. The last r n (t) obtained is used as the mean trend. The summation of every IMF and the mean trend can be used to reconstruct the initial signal X(t). After COP and EMG signals were decomposed by EMD into several IMFs, Hilbert Transform was used to calculate the instantaneous frequency of every IMF, using the following formula: where Hilbert transform Y(t) can be obtained for any time series X(t) and PV represents Cauchy Principal Value. Every X(t) that undergoes Hilbert transform becomes as follows This study uses the similarity index and synchronization analyses to investigate the correlation between the COP and EMG [19] [20] [21] . The similarity index is used to evaluate the similarity between two sets of signal fluctuation models and is obtained as follows: Step 1. Decimal signals are converted to binary signals using the following formula: In Figure 6 , the first data point is greater than the second data point and the interval between the two is coded to equal zero. The same applies to the second interval. The third data point is smaller than the fourth data point, and the third interval is coded to equal one, and so on and so forth.

The same applies to the second interval. The third data point is smaller than the fourth data point, and the third interval is coded to equal one, and so on and so forth. Step 2. The parameter m is set as the size of the moving window for use as the basis for the binary conversion to decimal. When m is set as 4, using the first moving window in Figure 6 as an example, the binary time-series of the window was 0010 and converted to decimal as 2. The binary time series of the second moving window was 0101 and converted to decimal as 5, and so on and so forth, to convert the binary time-series in the entire set into decimals. Step 3. As m was set to be 4, the numbers 0 to 15 will appear in the binary to decimal conversion. The decimal time-series after conversion are tallied, the probabilities for the appearance of the numbers 0 to 15 are calculated, these are plotted as a histogram and the probabilities are ranked from Step 2. The parameter m is set as the size of the moving window for use as the basis for the binary conversion to decimal.

The decimal time-series after conversion are tallied, the probabilities for the appearance of the numbers 0 to 15 are calculated, these are plotted as a histogram and the probabilities are ranked from largest to smallest. Figure 7 depicts the COP-ML (centre of pressure-medial lateral) signal results and the probability ranking of the numeral 0 was 2. Step 4. Steps 1-3 are repeated for another set of signals. Figure 8 depicts the results for the EMG-RF (electromyography-rectus femoris) muscles. Step 5. Scatterplots are generated for the numeral ranking of two sets of signals that are to be compared. Figure 9 illustrates the results of COP-ML and EMG for the RF muscles. If the points in the scatterplot are more concentrated at the 45-degree diagonal dotted line, the similarity in the fluctuation methods of both sets of signals is high. Step 6. The similarity index D m (COP, EMG) of COP and EMG is EMG) approaches one, the two sets of signals are similar. R 1 (w k ) represents the ranking of the k-th numeral of the first signal set and p 1 (w k ) is the probability of the k-th numeral appearing in the first signal set. Synchronization indices are used to evaluate the degree of phase coordination between two sets of signals [22, 23] . In this study, synchronization indices were used to evaluate the correlation of COP and EMG. The calculation of synchronization indices is based on the instantaneous phase and Shannon entropy and the process is as follows: Step 1. The Y(t) obtained from the Hilbert Transform is expressed as complex numbers, Y(t) = a(t) + ib(t). The instantaneous phase θ(t) is calculated from the real part a(t) and the imaginary part b(t). Step 2. The instantaneous phases obtained from the two sets of signals are subtracted from each other to obtain the phase difference. Step 3. The absolute value of the phase difference is obtained to plot the histogram of N number of intervals. phase difference(t) = |phase difference(t)| N = e 0.626+0.4×ln(n−1) , n is the total length of the data. Step 4. The Shannon entropy of the histogram is calculated. p is the probability of the occurrence for that interval. Step 5. The synchronization indices are calculated. Synchronization index = 1 − Shannon entropy ln(N) Firstly, the sampling was set to 100 Hz and experiments were designed to simultaneously measure the COP and EMG data. Subsequently, the EMD was used to decompose the COP and EMG signals into several IMFs and the average frequency of each IMF was calculated. The IMFs with similar COP and EMG signal-frequency-vibration modes were identified for synchronization analyses. Using data from closed eyes, standing still, and presence of soft foam as examples, Table 1 depicts the mean frequencies of each intrinsic-mode function in the left-right direction and anterior-posterior direction COP and the EMG of the RF, VL, TA, and GM. Statistical tests found that the IMF5 frequency of the COP signal and the IMF6 frequency of the EMG signal were not significantly different.

The frequency distribution of the two sets of signals were similar; the average frequency was 0.8 Hz with a range of 0-2 Hz. muscles and the similarity index, which was 0.956. The fluctuation modes of the two sets of signals are extremely similar and the similarity index was higher relative to the raw-signal (0.462). For the four muscles, the similarity between the raw signals and decomposed signals of the leftright direction and anterior-posterior direction, respectively, the COP and the EMG data were compared.

ML-RF is the similarity between the left-right COP and EMG of rectus femoris muscles.

ML-RF is the similarity between the left-right COP and EMG of rectus femoris muscles. The * symbol indicates that there are statistically-significant differences between the two signals. The mean similarity index of the raw signals was 0.5-0.6. The similarity index between the IMF5 of the COP signal and the IMF6 of the EMG signal was increased to greater than 0.95. The COP IMF5 and EMG IMF6 obtained from the statistical tests and the similarity index was used to replace the raw signals for subsequent analysis.  The authors declare no conflict of interest.@story_separate@In this study, different scenarios were designed to simultaneously collect COP and lower-limbmuscle EMG data to investigate the correlation between these two sets of parameters.

[18] studied seizure onset detection and seizure onset prediction using EEG signals by the EMD, DWT (discrete wavelet transform), and WPD (wavelet packet decomposition). The results indicated that DWT or WPD is better than EMD for feature extraction. This study applied the empirical mode decomposition that has been demonstrated that COP may provide enough information on postural stability without EMG data. Therefore, there is no comparison with other methods. The experimental analyses found that the IMFs that are similar for the COP and EMG signals are IMF5 and IMF6, respectively, and the average frequency was 0.8 Hz. The similarity index between the two was 0.95 to 1. This is higher than the similarity between the raw signals, which ranged from 0.5 to 0.6, and the difference was statistically significant. This is consistent with the results of Berg who highlighted that EMGs with frequencies less than 1 Hz were correlated with COP signals [23] . By analysing the synchronization indices, it was found that when postural stability is poor, EMG and COP were more synchronised with synchronisation indices approximately ranging from 0.010 to 0.015. With better postural stability, synchronization indices ranged from approximately 0.006 to 0.08 and both EMG and COP exhibited lower synchronization. Postural stability is relatively unstable when there is a greater synchronization between lower-limb muscle and postural stability. Conversely, when synchronization between lower-limb muscle and postural stability is low, postural stability is in a relatively stable state. The results of this study and those from Manor et al. [24] are consistent. Manor et al. [24] remarked that there is an inverse correlation between the synchronization of respiratory flow and postural stability and postural stability. Conversely, lower synchronization leads to improved postural stability. Manor et al. [24] also noted that the synchronization index between respiratory flow and COP in normal people and stroke patients were approximately 0.11 and 0.25, respectively. This difference is greater than the synchronization index between EMG and COP, which ranged from 0.006 to 0.015. This is mainly because for muscles that affect postural stability, the same muscle does not continuously affect postural stability to maintain postural stability. Therefore, postural stability will possibly be affected by RF in the initial 10 s, and then the TA on the right leg will affect postural stability in the subsequent 10 s. This is different from breathing, which continuously affects postural stability. Therefore, the values from synchronization analyses in this study are less than or equal to respiratory flow and COP. No fatigue was observed in the experimental data, which was used for joint analyses of the EMG spectrum and application, for any lower-limb muscle when subjects were standing for 1 min. In future research, increasing the duration that the subjects stand will be used to investigate how lower-limb-muscle fatigue affects the maintenance of postural stability. It is expected that the synchronization indices will increase when muscles are fatigued.","The aim of this study is to see if the centre of pressure (COP) measurements on the postural stability can be used to represent the electromyography (EMG) measurement on the activity data of lower limb muscles. If so, the cost-effective COP data measurements can be used to indicate the level of postural stability and lower limb muscle activity. The Hilbert–Huang Transform method was used to analyse the data from the experimental designed to examine the correlation between lower-limb muscles and postural stability. We randomly selected 24 university students to participate in eight scenarios and simultaneously measured their COP and EMG signals during the experiments. The Empirical Mode Decomposition was used to identify the intrinsic-mode functions (IMF) that can distinguish between the COP and EMG at different states. Subsequently, similarity indices and synchronization analyses were used to calculate the correlation between the lower-limb muscle strength and the postural stability. The IMF5 of the COP signals and the IMF6 of the EMG signals were not significantly different and the average frequency was 0.8 Hz, with a range of 0–2 Hz. When the postural stability was poor, the COP and EMG had a high synchronization with index values within the range of 0.010–0.015. With good postural stability, the synchronization indices were between 0.006 and 0.080 and both exhibited low synchronization. The COP signals and the low frequency EMG signals were highly correlated. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the COP may provide enough information on postural stability without the EMG data."
"In the United States (U.S.), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causing coronavirus disease 2019 has resulted in over 12 million reported cases and 250,000 deaths as of November 25, 2020 [1] . However, the true number of infections is thought to be far greater, as an estimated 15-40% of infections are asymptomatic [2] [3] [4] , and many persons with symptoms either do not seek medical care or are not tested. Furthermore, case counts reported by state and territorial health departments are affected by changes in testing and reporting capacity and practices, all of which can distort the apparent extent of infections and disease in the population at a given time. Given that the majority of persons that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop antibodies following infection [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has been used as an indicator of cumulative infections in a given population since the start of the pandemic [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Seroprevalence estimates can capture mild or asymptomatic infections that may be missed in reported case counts. They therefore allow better estimates of the true burden of infection, informing public health interventions. In addition, seroprevalence estimates can indicate population-level immunity, and the coverage of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines when they become available, both of which have implications for future transmission [15, 16] . While seroprevalence rates have been used to estimate the proportion of the population that has never been infected, they are not necessarily a perfect indicator. If antibody levels wane and become undetectable over time, as has been suggested by recent reports [5, 7, 8] , this could affect the accuracy of these estimates as the pandemic progresses. We and others have reported on seroprevalence estimates throughout in the pandemic [10, 11, 13, 17, 18] , with many seroprevalence studies focused on assessing a narrow time window or single geographic location. In this study, the availability of a large number of residual sera collected from patients during the course of routine blood tests allowed us to estimate seroprevalence in 10 sites across the U.S. at multiple time points. In each of the sites, we compare the seroprevalence A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t trajectories to reported cases for a pandemic that has been heterogeneous with respect to time and geography.@story_separate@The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) partnered with two commercial laboratory companies to select a random sample of deidentified sera remnants from a population of convenience, as previously described [17] . To be included, specimens must have been from routine diagnostic tests, such as metabolic panels or cholesterol levels, blinded to COVID-19 symptoms or diagnosis, that were collected from patients between March 23 and August 14, 2020, and, at minimum, included demographic information on age, sex, zip code of patient, and date of specimen collection. Our target sample size was 1,800 specimens per site per round with 450 specimens in each of four age groups (0-18, 19-49, 50-64, and 65+ years), based on calculations of statistical power needed to estimate a prevalence within +/-2% in a population with 5% prevalence. The laboratories generated de-duplicated, de-identified sample lists from their internal electronic laboratory information systems of all specimens with sufficient serum volume. Specimens were sampled by stratified random sampling by age group, with the aim of collecting equal numbers of specimens for each of the four age groups. Each round of specimens covered a one-week period of collections, except for Utah and Minnesota, which covered a two-week period, as fewer specimens were available per week. Specimen collection rounds were a minimum of three weeks apart for each site, and sites were not synchronized. Between three and five specimen collection rounds occurred in ten sites, one from each of the 10 Health and Human Services regions (Fig e1) This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. § Informed consent was waived, as de-identified data were used. The results from individual timepoints were previously released on CDC's website [19] . Sera were tested with a CDC assay as previously described [17] . Briefly, sera specimens were tested with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against pan-immunoglobin (pan-Ig) to the antispike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Signal-to-threshold ratios were calculated from optical density results with a reactive cutoff of >1.0. A receiver operator curve was created to maximize overall accuracy. The pan-Ig assay performed with a sensitivity of 96.0% (CI: 89.98 -98.89%) and a specificity of 99.3% (CI: 98.32 -99.88%) against a PCR-confirmed test set [20] . Age-sex-standardized estimates of seroprevalence with confidence intervals that account for serology assay performance were generated using a two-stage bootstrap method described previously [17] . M a n u s c r i p t consistent over time but were updated from the second timepoint onwards in NY, WA, and PA, based on counties that provided the majority of specimens (Supplement). To assess the relative magnitude and significance of changes in seroprevalence over time, while accounting for uncertainty in sampling and lab assay accuracy, we used Bayesian hierarchical modeling to obtain the joint posterior distribution of our parameters, optimized by Gibbs sampling [21] . Equations are listed in the statistical Appendix; briefly, we modeled the odds of having detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at each site, assuming a binomial distribution for antibody detection and using a logit link, as a function of the following parameters: age, sex, county, and time period (an indicator variable for change between sequential collection rounds). Relative risks were calculated from the posterior probabilities of positivity as described in the appendix. For UT, model diagnostics indicated a poor fit, so we instead used a non-parametric permutation method (Appendix). Publicly reported daily case data at the county level were obtained from USAFacts [22] . County-level population projections by age and sex were downloaded from the U.S. Census Bureau [23]. Statistical analyses were programmed in R 3.6.1 and RStudio v1.2.1335 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). A total of 78,990 specimens were collected from patients between March 23 and August 14, 2020 across ten sites. Of those, 43.7% (34,516) were male. The median age was 55, with 59.0% (46,628) of all specimens from patients over 50 years of age. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of patient specimens at each site. A comparison of demographic and geographic information over each A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t timepoint shows that our samples remained generally consistent within sites for known characteristics and are coming from the same source counties except for the first timepoint in NY, WA, and PA (Table e1) . In the northeastern U.S., including NY, PA, and CT, reported cases increased markedly in April 2020, around or just before the first time point. New York had the most dynamic changes in seroprevalence and the highest seroprevalence, increasing from 6.9% by April 1 to 23.2% by April 16, as estimated by the bootstrap analysis (adjusted Risk Ratio (aRR) from Bayesian analysis: 2.3, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.4 -4.9, Table 2 and Figure 1a ). Daily reported cases in NY then steadily declined; subsequent seroprevalence measurements indicated a small decrease by the first week of May (aRR 0.7, CI: 0.6-0.9). In PA and CT, cases also began to decline gradually starting in May ( Figure   e2b -c), and the aRR of detectable antibodies was not statistically different from 1.0 in CT and PA. In MN, reported cases first increased in early May, and remained elevated throughout our study period without clear peaks or declines. Seroprevalence climbed from 2.4% by May 12 to 6.1% by July 18. Increases during late June and early July were statistically significant (Figure e2d ). In the southern U.S. (FL, LA), seroprevalence rose gradually in April and May; FL increased to 2.8% and LA to 5.8% by April 23 (Figure e2g ). Both sites experienced a marked increase in cases starting in late June through late July. By July 23, seroprevalence in FL rose to 13.3% (aRR 2.5, CI: 1.7 -3. (table 3) . At the first time point, estimated actual infections exceeded reported cases by at least ten-fold in seven of 10 sites (range 6 to 24-fold, Table 2 ); by the fourth time point, the ratio of estimated infections to reported cases was between two-fold in Missouri to seven-fold in NY. In a large-scale SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study, we collected and tested 78,990 specimens from ten U.S. sites that experienced different epidemic curves, over multiple timepoints between March and August 2020. Our use of convenience samples of commercial laboratory residual sera allowed serial measurements of seroprevalence from a large number of specimens drawn from similar sampling frames. During this period, less than 10% of the population had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in all sites except NY and FL. Through Bayesian modeling, we determined that seroprevalence increases in NY, FL, UT, and MO, which were observed following an increase in reported cases, were statistically significant. We also observed statistically significant declines in A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t seroprevalence in MO, UT, NY, and WA, following periods of stable, low numbers of cases. This decrease in seroprevalence, even in settings with ongoing transmission, may suggest that waning of assay-detectable antibodies may be occurring; the effects of waning antibodies on overall seroprevalence may be more apparent during periods with fewer new cases, possibly in combination with changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors and changing adherence to stay-at-home orders. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, seroprevalence estimates have been used to estimate cumulative incidence of infection [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 18] . These studies can capture a broader range of infections than case reporting, including mild or asymptomatic cases that may go undetected and unreported. Our seroprevalence estimates at specific time points are similar to those of other studies undertaken in similar locations, including in San Francisco, Utah, and Miami-Dade [24] [25] [26] . In New York, seroprevalence in a state-wide survey of grocery store patrons was 14% in late March [12], and serial samples in a health care setting found a peak of seroprevalence of 19.3% by mid-April [27] , both approximating our estimates. In a representative survey in Connecticut, seroprevalence was 3.1%, lower than our estimate of 6.2% at a comparable timepoint, although lower assay sensitivity and different sampling methods may explain some of the difference in results [28] . At all ten sites, across all time periods during the study, the estimated number of infections was much higher than the number of reported cases. This case ascertainment ratio changed over the course of the study, from at least 10-fold in seven sites [17] , to between two-to seven-fold. This decrease may be due to several factors, including improved testing availability, changing testing patterns [29] and increased contact tracing, thus potentially resulting in the detection and reporting of a larger proportion of infections. Changes in healthcare-seeking behavior may also have affected both case reporting and seroprevalence estimates in unpredictable ways. The case ascertainment ratio based on seroprevalence is a conservative estimate, however, as some individuals infected near the end of our specimen collection period may have not yet developed antibodies and not all A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t infected persons develop antibodies. We would also be unable to detect antibodies lost due to waning in previously infected persons, which would underestimate the population that has been infected. The observation that seroprevalence stayed flat, or even decreased, in some sites, while cumulative case counts increased at all ten sites, offers indirect evidence of waning levels of assay-detectable antibodies in a certain proportion of the population. In the absence of waning, repeated serological testing of similar samples from a population in which the virus continues to circulate should find that the number of persons with past infection increases monotonically. Reports on humoral response and antibody kinetics found waning anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels among a subset of recovered patients along timelines that our study would have captured, with declines 40-60 days after the onset of symptoms [7, 8, 14] . IgG antibodies typically have a half-life of 7-21 days [30] , but IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which our ELISA assay can detect, may persist longer [5, 31] . Antibody levels following infection also appear positively correlated with disease severity [5, 7] . Many infections identified through seroprevalence studies likely had mild or asymptomatic disease, and thus potentially lower initial antibody titers than reported cases. These persons may be more likely A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t Our study has several limitations. While use of residual clinical specimens allows for large sample sizes spanning multiple timepoints, the population from whom these are drawn could differ from the population in multiple ways discussed previously [17] . Although the laboratory sera were sampled from routine tests not directly associated with COVID-19, increases in symptomatic infections may have driven a disproportionate number of COVID-19-infected patients to clinical settings, and the clinical specimens could have been taken as part of their acute or follow-up care. Pediatric specimens sometimes did not meet our sample size targets in some sites, especially Utah, likely because healthy children infrequently have blood drawn. In some instances, there was geographic variability within a site over time, with variability especially in suburban counties at some sites. Given local geographic variation in SARS-CoV-2 clusters, this may have affected our seroprevalence estimates, although our multivariable model for relative odds of seropositivity controlled for county. In addition, as noted above, healthcare-seeking behavior likely also changed over time for the general population [35] . This could potentially affect the study population from whom residual clinical samples are available, potentially biasing these seroprevalence estimates in unpredictable ways. Since our data were drawn from serial independent samples and not cohorts, the effects of antibody waning and potential sampling biases are inextricable. In addition, not all persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 mount an antibody response [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .@story_separate@This study shows that as of August 2020, most of the predominantly adult population sampled from clinical laboratories in the 10 sites studied had no evidence of having past infection with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, among people who become infected, a majority-many of whom likely had mild or asymptomatic infections-are not captured through case reporting, although the gap between estimated infections based on seroprevalence and reported case has decreased over time. Our M a n u s c r i p t M a n u s c r i p t M a n u s c r i p t M a n u s c r i p t 1.0 (0.9, 1.2) 0.9 (0.6, 1.1) 0.9, (0.7, 1.1) 1.5 (0.7, 2.7) 1.1 (0.9, 1.5) 1.0 (0.8, 1.1) 0.9 (0.5, 1.","BACKGROUND: Monitoring of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody prevalence can complement case reporting to inform more accurate estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection burden, but few studies have undertaken repeated sampling over time on a broad geographic scale. METHODS: We performed serologic testing on a convenience sample of residual sera obtained from persons of all ages, at ten sites in the United States from March 23 through August 14, 2020, from routine clinical testing at commercial laboratories. We age-sex-standardized our seroprevalence rates using census population projections and adjusted for laboratory assay performance. Confidence intervals were generated with a two-stage bootstrap. We used Bayesian modeling to test whether seroprevalence changes over time were statistically significant. RESULTS: Seroprevalence remained below 10% at all sites except New York and Florida, where it reached 23.2% and 13.3%, respectively. Statistically significant increases in seroprevalence followed peaks in reported cases in New York, South Florida, Utah, Missouri and Louisiana. In the absence of such peaks, some significant decreases were observed over time in New York, Missouri, Utah, and Western Washington. The estimated cumulative number of infections with detectable antibody response continued to exceed reported cases in all sites. CONCLUSIONS: Estimated seroprevalence was low in most sites, indicating that most people in the U.S. have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 as of July 2020. The majority of infections are likely not reported. Decreases in seroprevalence may be related to changes in healthcare-seeking behavior, or evidence of waning of detectable anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody levels at the population level. Thus, seroprevalence estimates may underestimate the cumulative incidence of infection."
"Colorectal cancer is the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal cancer. In 2018, it represented 1.8 million cases and 881,000 deaths worldwide and was responsible for 1 in 10 cancer deaths [1] . It also represented 12.8% of all cancers in Europe with a 12.6% mortality rate [2] . Waiting lists for surgery and treatment for colorectal cancer are a problem in most countries, and there is conflicting evidence as to whether time from diagnosis to surgery has an influence on postoperative complications and long-term survival. Gort et al. reported that time to treatment and stage were independently associated with 3-year disease-free survival in rectal cancer patients [3] . Yun et al. reported similar results where treatment delays beyond 1 month were not associated with worse survival in a variety of gastrointestinal cancers including colon cancer, but did show a decrease in survival for rectal cancer [4] . Other authors have recently suggested a 3-6-week ideal time frame for first treatment of colorectal cancer patients, with an 8 to 14% higher 5-year survival rate for stage I-III colon cancer patients [5] . The global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has led to overloading and collapse of many national health systems with a need to defer treatment for many non-COVID-19 serious acute and chronic conditions [6, 7] . Several medical associations have published guidelines and practice parameters for the management and triage of these conditions during the COVID-19 crisis, offering alternative options during the lack of available hospital resources. Among these are those belonging to the Italian, Spanish, and the UK colorectal societies [8] , published on their respective websites [9, 10] . Recommendations include triaging cancer patients according to the urgency of each case and the need for immediate treatment. These groups include immediate treatment for emergency cases at risk of obstruction or perforation, deferring earlier stage cases past the pandemic crisis or prolonging neoadjuvant therapies for more advanced cases. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the wait list time (WLT) on long-term overall disease-free survival in patients scheduled for colorectal cancer resection and assist WLT management during the COVID-19 pandemic or other future crisis.@story_separate@A prospective cohort single-center study was carried out in patients undergoing definitive surgery for colorectal cancer from 2012 to 2017 and followed up until March 2020. Data was collected from a prospective institutional clinical database and subsequently analyzed. All patients were operated on by one of the 5 members of a highly specialized colorectal unit from a tertiary hospital and received standard multimodal enhanced recovery pre-and postoperative care without prehabilitation. The choice to perform laparoscopic or open surgery was up to surgeon preference and patient or tumor characteristics. Patients who had American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I through III confirmed adenocarcinomas were selected, with ""colon"" or ""upper rectum"" as their primary site of malignancy according to International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition topography code. Patients were excluded if they had emergency surgery, more than one primary site, synchronous metastasis, or peritoneal carcinomatosis at the time of surgery, and if they received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or a local transanal excision. AJCC stage was determined postoperatively by pathological staging in all cases. WLT was defined as the time between diagnosis and definitive surgery. Diagnosis was defined as completion of diagnostic workup which included colonoscopy with biopsy and abdominal computed tomography scan for colon cancers, with the addition of rigid proctoscopy, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging scan, and endorectal ultrasound scan for rectal tumors. The whole ""fast-track"" oncological diagnostic circuit takes between 7 and 10 days. WLT was divided into 2-week intervals ranging from 0 to 6 weeks. Patients who were more than 6 weeks on the waiting list were an insufficient number to create subgroups beyond this time-point and were grouped into the same category as over 6 weeks. The outcome variables were 2-year and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and excluded patients who died in the immediate postoperative period (30 postoperative days). Screening for disease progression was performed with 6 monthly serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and chest/ abdominal computed tomography scan performed after elevation of CEA levels or at yearly intervals if the latter were normal. Standard adjuvant chemotherapy was administered 6 weeks after surgery for AJCC stage III tumors and stage II tumors with pathological risk factors for local or systemic recurrence. Other variables analyzed were age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index score, tumor stage, resection margins, surgical approach, and postoperative complications. Institutional board approval was obtained, and patients signed informed consent. The work has been reported in line with the STROCSS criteria. [11] Statistical analysis A descriptive analysis was performed, and quantitative variables were tested for normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Qualitative data were expressed as n (%) and quantitative data as median (interquartile range). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for non-parametric data and the chi-squared test for quantitative variables. The DFS for each time interval was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test to assess for differences between curves. Cox regression was used to assess if WLT was prognostic for DFS. Statistical analysis was carried with the IBM® SPSS® Statistics Version 26 for MAC. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 707 patients with AJCC stage I through III colorectal cancer who did not receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy were initially included. After applying the remaining exclusion criteria (synchronous colon/rectal tumors (24) , local excisions (17), anal squamous cell carcinoma (10), appendix tumors (3), metachronous tumors (3), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (2)), a cohort of 648 patients was defined. Twenty-four patients were lost to follow-up, and there were 22 postoperative deaths. Finally, 602 patients were included for analysis; 364 (60.5%) males with a median (range) age of 73 years (71) were defined for the study. Median follow-up was 51.5 months (98). Median WLT was 28 days (99). Median body mass index (BMI) was 26 (32), preoperative hemoglobin 12.3 g/dL (8.2), preoperative albumin 4.1 g/dL (0.9), and Charlson Comorbidity Index 5.5 (13) . A total of 471 (78.2%) of tumors were located in the colon and 131 (21.7%) in the rectum. Laparoscopy was performed in 454 (75.4%); median DFS was 43 months (range = 98). Two-year and 5-year DFS rates were 521 (86.5%) and 500 (83.1%) respectively. Table 1 shows adjusted patient and tumor data by WLT 2 weekly intervals. There were significantly lower hemoglobin and albumin levels in the 0-2-week group and a higher proportion of laparoscopic procedures in the 4-6 and over the 6-week groups. Other patient and tumor characteristics showed no significant differences between WLTs. Twenty-two patients (3.4%) died in the postoperative period. There were no significant differences between the WLT regarding postoperative deaths (p = 0.442). WLT did not statistically significantly impact on 2-year or 5-year DFS for the group as a whole (Fig. 1) . The 2-year DFS showed no trend or differences between stages (Fig. 2) . The 5-year DFS for the 2-4 and 4-6-week WLT interval was significantly higher for AJCC stage II tumors (Fig. 3) . WLT was not found to be prognostic for DFS on Cox-regression analysis for the group either as a whole (p = 0.414) or when analyzed by tumor stage (p = 0.712). This study analyses the possible effect of WLT on patients scheduled for AJCC stage I through III colorectal cancer who did not receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy. The time lapse between wait list inclusion and operation date was divided into 2-week intervals. The only sub-group of patients who showed a statistically significant difference between WLTs were patients with stage II AJCC cancers In addition, there was a statistically significant increase in hemoglobin and albumin levels with WLT and a higher proportion of laparoscopic cases. There is a twofold interpretation to these results. Firstly, the 2-6-week WLT allows for adequate optimization of nutritional status and anemia, both factors having an impact on postoperative complications and long-term survival [12] [13] [14] [15] . We did not have a formal trimodal prehabilitation program in place at the time of the study, though preoperative optimization of anemia, malnutrition, and comorbid conditions was carried out. Secondly, there may have been some selection bias, with priority given to patients with larger tumors, lower hemoglobin and albumin levels, and a possible risk of complications such as perforation or obstruction, making laparoscopy less likely in these cases, as reported by other authors [5, 16] . Surgery for colorectal cancer is necessary to obtain cure, and long WLTs cause considerable stress and worry for patients and relatives [17, 18] who usually push for prompt intervention. The results of this study reassure surgeons and patients that scheduling surgery between 2 and 6 weeks does not negatively affect DFS and allows for adequate optimization and preparation of the patient for the operation. There are several advantages to a 2-6-week WLT. It allows for availability of hospital resources and better preoperative oncological workup. In addition, a duration of 4 weeks is the recommended time to implement most prehabilitation programs improving nutritional, physical, and psychological patient status [19, 20] . Prehabilitation programs have been shown to improve postoperative patient recovery and decrease complications with the largest amount of literature in colorectal, thoracic, and urology patients [20] [21] [22] . Scheduling surgery between 2 and 6 weeks provides a window of opportunity to properly optimize and prehabilitate patients prior to surgery and improve surgical outcomes. This WLT is particularly relevant at the moment. The COVID-19 pandemic has stretched and overloaded hospital capacity and resources worldwide. Medical and surgical beds have been occupied by COVID-19 patients. There has been a shortage in intensive care beds and operating rooms have been adapted and equipped for treating severely ill COVID-19 patients in many hospitals [7] . This has led to a severe shortage in available resources for surgical patients and most scheduled surgeries have been postponed. The few surgical resources available have been reserved for emergencies or very pressing oncological cases as recommended by the vast majority of surgical societies worldwide [6, [8] [9] [10] 23] . The effect of delaying surgery on cancer prognosis is unclear. This depends on tumor type, stage, and the length of time to surgery [3, 5] . Other factors known to influence survival are preoperative hemoglobin and albumin levels [15] , location of the tumor [4] , and preoperative comorbid conditions [3] . The vast majority of studies focus on the screening delays for colonoscopy and diagnosis of the cancer rather than on the surgical wait list from the date of inclusion to operation date [24, 25] . The impact of diagnostic delay on survival has been extensively studied with particular emphasis on colonoscopy screening programs [24, 26] . T∅rring et al. studied the results from 11,720 patients from five European data sets and found that longer diagnostic intervals in the primary care setting were associated with more advanced colorectal cancers. Conversely, specialist intervals up to 60 days from diagnosis were inversely proportional to cancer stage [27] . There are four time points in the run up to treatment where a delay may occur. Onset of symptoms is often preceded by a long asymptomatic phase with increasing degeneration [28] ; so initially, there is the time that the patient takes for symptom recognition and consultation with the primary care physician [29] . Following this, there is the delay in endoscopic diagnosis followed by the hand-over of patient and results to the surgeon or oncologist, and finally the delay from diagnosis to treatment. The surgical WLT of 6 weeks may be only a drop in the ocean, and not be the major factor influencing long-term DFS when compared to the time from first symptom to diagnosis, which could be several months [24, 26, 30] . Recommended waiting times vary between countries with a clear example of a 2-week circuit in the UK which has not led to diagnosis of earlier stage cancers or improved long-term survival [31] , or the socially acceptable rather than medically based standard published in the Netherlands [32] . The WLT may also depend on infrastructure of high-volume vs. low-volume hospitals where hospital crowding may play an important role [4] . Other authors also report on factors influencing WLT. Gort et al. [3] divide WLT in above or below 7 weeks and found that WLT below 7 weeks had a positive influence on survival for rectal cancer. Similar results were found by Yun et al. [4] who described a worse survival for rectal but not for colon cancer patients with WLTs over 1 month. Kucejko et al. [5] recently reported that a 3-4 week WLT was associated with the highest long-term survival for colon cancer and Turaga et al. [16] report that most cancer WLTs can be postponed more than 4 weeks from diagnosis without influencing long-term survival. Other authors have found no significant influence of WLTs on long-term survival [24, 25, 33, 34] albeit most studies focus on WLTs below 6 weeks. Our results are similar to those reported by Kaltenmeier et al., who found that wait list times greater than 30 days or within the first week independently increased mortality risk [35] . The limitations of this study are that it is a single-center retrospective analysis of data from a prospective institutional database. The lack of statistically significant differences in 5-year DFS for AJCC stage I and III cancers according to WLT could be attributed to the number of patients included in the study, albeit large for a singlecenter study, would probably require a multi-center trial or national database analysis to fully answer this question. This was a non-randomized study and the decision to operate at any particular time was based on order of wait list inclusion and on the possible risk of preoperative tumor-related complications. Ethical issues together with wait list campaigns and recommendations did not allow WLTs longer than 14 weeks, and the majority of cases were treated in the first 6 weeks. A minority of patients underwent surgery after this period, and the effect on WLT longer than 6 weeks remains unknown as there were too few patients in this group to create WLT subgroups beyond 6 weeks. There is currently no evidence for the maximum WLT. As previously mentioned, we did not assess the delay before referral for surgery. Time from diagnosis to treatment is only a part of the total delay. Patient socioeconomic level and access to health services has also been shown to influence survival and WLT and was not assessed in this study. The Spanish health system is public, and treatment is widely available to all patients regardless of their socioeconomic level, and therefore, this study did not address these issues. Nevertheless, the strengths of this study are the large number of patients included from a highly specialized colorectal unit with long follow-ups and rigorous database completion and statistics. The study protocol was approved by the hospital ethics committee.

Early care is important to alleviate psychological stress in patients and families particularly when hospital resources are stretched as in the COVID-19 pandemic, but these results help alleviate some of these concerns. Furthermore, a 4-week window offers the possibility to optimize and prehabilitate the patient. Further well-designed prospective randomized studies with different WLT intervals could throw more light on these questions.

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of wait list time on long-term disease-free survival in patients scheduled for colorectal cancer resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for surgery at a tertiary care center. Wait list time was defined as the time from completion of diagnostic workup to definitive surgery and divided into 2-week intervals from 0 to 6 weeks. The outcome variables were 2-year and 5-year disease-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 602 patients, 364 (60.5%) male, median age 73 years (range = 71) were defined. The median wait list time was 28 days (range = 99). Two and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 521 (86.5%) and 500 (83.1%) respectively. There were no differences in 2-year or 5-year disease-free survival for the whole cohort or by tumor stage between wait list time intervals except for AJCC stage II tumors which showed a higher 5-year disease-free survival for the 2–4 and 4–6-week wait list time interval (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Time from diagnosis to definitive surgery up to 6 weeks is not associated with a decrease in 2-year or 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) in AJCC stage I through III colorectal cancer patients. These are important findings in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic and offer a window of opportunity for preoperative optimization and prehabilitation."
"Respiratory rate measurement has been shown to be able to predict adverse clinical events, such as admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Under specific circumstances, it is more effective than pulse or blood measurements at discriminating between stable patients and patients at risk [1, 2] . However, the number of trials in which the respiratory rate has been studied remains limited and mostly confined to the use of spot measurements. The work by Yañez et al. [3] is based on a direct measurement of the flow to assess the respiratory frequency in COPD patients. In this study, it was observed than the mean respiratory rate was raised 15 days prior to hospitalization (two days before, 15% more with respect to the baseline; the day before,@story_separate@The goal of the presented work is to compare a metabolic cart, considered a gold standard, with Airgo™ (MYAIR Inc, Boston, MA, USA; MyAirgo Italy Srl, Milan, Italy), a resistance-based wearable device able to derive breathing parameters from body surface motion detection acquired at the level of the lower ribcage. A study protocol has been conducted on a population of twenty-one healthy subjects comparing the output of the Airgo™ system with the SensorMedics 2900 metabolic cart (SensorMedics Inc., Yorba Linda, CA, USA) [22] . The research has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the Azienda Ospedaliera S. Croce e Carle in Cuneo (Opinion number 3-17, 7 June 2017) and was part of the clinical trial NCT03368612 (""Comparative study between the Airgo™ system and standard tests in the assessment of the respiratory function""). In the first part of the protocol, the healthy subjects were asked to perform quiet breath maneuvers in five different standardized postures while wearing the Airgo™ device: standing position, sitting position with back against chair, supine position, right lateral decubitus and left lateral decubitus. In the second part of the test, after the completion of the test at rest, a symptom-limited incremental exercise was performed on the electronically braked cycle ergometer Ergoline 800s (ergoline GmbH, Bitz, Germany). The obtained data have been processed to allow the extraction of relevant respiratory parameters. The comparison between the two systems was done considering the following four parameters: normalized tidal volume, respiratory rate, normalized minute ventilation and duty cycle. The Airgo™ band measures the thoracic circumference changes with a stretchable knitted matrix of nylon and spandex with a knitted-in silver coated yarn. The system employs an electrically conductive, The system calculates resistance changes continuously. Each variation in resistance values, caused by each expansion and volume reduction of the chest wall during breathing activity, reflects a measurable variation in current in the silver-coated wire. The stretchable band is coupled to a microprocessor, embedded in a sintered nylon shell. The microprocessor includes an SD memory card and monitors the respiratory activity by collecting raw data at a frequency of 10 Hz. The microprocessor includes: an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that converts the analog resistance level of the girth band into a 10-bit number ranging from 0 to 1023 and corresponding to the amplitude of the torso expressed in arbitrary units; a battery for operating the microprocessor and for charging the band; paths to transfer data to the SD card for on-board data storage; a Bluetooth module to wirelessly communicate with a computational device (laptop computer or smartphone). The device's on-board microprocessor is connected to a nine-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU). The motion detection circuit provides movement and postural orientation datapoints with the final aim to associate breathing information to the patient's posture or activity. An activity recognition algorithm based on raw accelerometer data has been developed and is described by Qi and Aliverti [23] . The girth band is operably coupled at the first end to the microprocessor and then encircles the torso at the level of the lower rib cage. It is then coupled at the second end to the microprocessor from the other side. When in use, the band is pre-tensioned to ensure a fit around the torso that does not dislocate when the band is worn and can record data without interruption. The part in direct contact with the skin is made of a silicon rubber with a thickness of about 0.35 mm called GECKO ® (Gottlieb Binder GmbH & Co. KG, Holzgerlingen, Germany), or gecko tape, because it emulates the adhesion of gecko feet and can be attached to both wet and dry vertical surfaces. This material can be detached easily and quickly from a surface, while it shows exceptional adhesion properties when attached to it. Figure 2 shows a typical stretch metallic knit static resistance qualitative curve. Initially, the resistance rapidly changes with elongation (L0 to L1). Following this initial phase, there is an approximately linear increase in resistance with respect to length (L1 to L2). Resistance continues to increase with length but with less marginal increment, as shown from L2 to LT, which is the threshold above which resistance decreases with increasing length until the elastic band reaches its maximum length (LM). The operative range of the band is therefore within the range L1-L2 in order to obtain accurate measurements without significant calibration difficulties.

It was conducted at the Azienda Sanitaria Ospedaliera (ASO) S. Croce e Carle, Allergologia e Fisiopatologia Respiratoria, Cuneo (CN), Piemonte. The 21 healthy subjects comprised 11 females and 10 males with a mean age of 36 (age range from 24 to 51), mean weight of 67 kg (standard deviation ±16 kg) and mean height of 170 cm (standard deviation ± 8 cm). In order to be enrolled in the study, the following inclusion criteria have been used:  This study is a monocentric, prospective, observational, single arm clinical trial involving 21 healthy volunteers.

In order to be enrolled in the study, the following inclusion criteria have been used: •  The acquisition protocol was divided into three main phases: (1) Preparation: measurement of the subject's thoracic oblique circumference length (C) at the end of a forced expiration maneuver. Knowing this measurement, the initial length of the elastic band (L0) was decided to be 7% shorter than C in order to obtain a pre-tensioned girth band to ensure an effective fit around the torso. After being cut, the band was coupled with the Airgo™ electronic device and positioned against the subject's skin; (2) Test at rest: recording of respiratory parameters while letting the subject breathe quietly in five different standardized positions (standing, seated, supine, right lateral decubitus, left lateral decubitus) for 4 min. The supine position required an elevation of the subject's head not greater than 10 • with a pillow under the subject's head. Tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, inspiratory time, expiratory time and duty cycle (explained in Table 1 ) were simultaneously recorded by the Airgo™ system and the SensorMedics 2900 metabolic cart. In order to facilitate the off-line synchronization between the two systems, subjects were asked to perform a big, deep breath at the beginning of the test for each position; (3) Test under physical exercise: execution of a cardiopulmonary exercise test on the Ergoline cycle ergometer 800S, followed by a recovery period. A symptom-limited incremental exercise test was performed and designed to achieve a maximum load in 10 ± 2 min in each subject wearing the Airgo™ device. The physical exercise test followed a linear incremental protocol (with a slope between 15 and 20 Watts per minute) was identical for men and women and chosen based on the level of training of each subject so that each test lasted approximately between 6 and 12 min, as recommended in the guidelines. Subjects were asked to cycle at a velocity of 60 revolutions/minute for 2 min with no load, then to pedal at incremental workload maintaining the same speed as before until the maximal effort was reached. Once the subject reached his/her maximal effort and he/she was not able to ride anymore, the exercise test was interrupted, and the recovery phase started. This phase consisted of cycling for 2 min without any resistance followed by 2 min at rest. The same respiratory parameters as test at rest have been acquired with the big-breath synchronization maneuver.  Airgo™'s processing unit acquires a respiratory signal based on the change in girth band resistance over time. Many other factors not related to the breath cycle may influence the stretched length of the band, causing girth measurement inflections at a much higher frequency than that of the breath. Therefore, raw data have been processed to filter out motion and heartbeat artefacts. The latter are characterized by a smaller amplitude and a higher frequency with respect to the respiratory signal. The system samples data at a frequency of 10 Hz, averages the acquired data over 9-34 reading, blurs the averaged data from 0.3 to 1 s to filter out artefacts, determines the beginning and the end of a breath and records an adverse event if a predetermined period of time has elapsed without detecting a new breath, as is described in the related patent (number US201462007142P). Filtering has an effect on knit motion artefacts, too. The total measured breath cycle resembled an upside-down ""W"" (Figure 3 ): this non-correspondence is not only due to the heartbeat but also to the motion and acceleration artefacts of the signal coming from the knitted metallic band. A portion of the resistance is static and related to the static length of the stretched knit (the overall bell shape), but part of the resistance is also due to the spontaneous motion of the fabric. This accounts for the slight hump at the beginning of the total measured breath cycle and the double hump in the middle.

This accounts for the slight hump at the beginning of the total measured breath cycle and the double hump in the middle. Once raw data are filtered, they are processed in order to obtain the proper breath signal. The main steps of this process, shown in Figure 4 , can be summarized as follows: Identification of maximum and minimum of each breathing cycle;  Representation of each breath by means of a vector that connects the maximum and the minimum;  Automatic reconstruction of segmented breath, e.g., due to obstructions or movement;  Automatic removal of fake breaths;  Computation of tidal volume, respiratory rate and minute ventilation. Breath data can be then transmitted to a computer via Bluetooth Low Energy, stored, visualized and further analyzed using Airgo™'s dedicated software.

The signal acquired by the girth band is expressed in arbitrary units ranging from 0 to 1023 (10bit analog to digital converter) and expresses the amplitude of the signal recorded in the range of differential potential levels between 0.5 and 3.6 V, which is the microprocessor supply voltage. This signal represents the signal amplitude variation due to the trunk expansion and reduction during breathing. In Figure 5 , an explicative diagram of the feature extraction process is reported.

Figure 5 . Box scheme of the raw signal processing and extraction process of the parameters of interest: amplitude (Amp), which represents Airgo™'s signal variation and models SensorMedics' tidal volume; respiratory rate (RR); Airgo™'s minute ventilation (Amp×RR), which models SensorMedics' minute ventilation; duty cycle, which is the ratio between inspiratory time and total breath period.

Box scheme of the raw signal processing and extraction process of the parameters of interest: amplitude (Amp), which represents Airgo™'s signal variation and models SensorMedics' tidal volume; respiratory rate (RR); Airgo™'s minute ventilation (Amp×RR), which models SensorMedics' minute ventilation; duty cycle, which is the ratio between inspiratory time and total breath period. As the breath period (T) is computed as the temporal distance between two consecutive minima, the respiratory rate is the inverse of the breath period expressed as breaths per minute and the expiratory time is computed as the difference between breath period and the inspiratory time. Among SensorMedics' data, outliers, fake breaths and missing data were detected and deleted. These errors may be due to the incorrect positioning of the mouthpiece and the consequent air leakage. In these cases, it is necessary not to consider the entire breath. In order to validate the Airgo™ system, a breath-by-breath comparison with the SensorMedics outputs was performed. Since the amplitude (Amp) represents the same features as the tidal volume read by the metabolic cart and expressed in liters, the values obtained with the two devices had to be normalized in order to be compared. For each position of each subject, the mean of the first twenty values of quiet breathing after the initial big breath was computed and used as a reference. This leads to normalized values for Airgo™'s amplitude and minute ventilation and the corresponding SensorMedics' volume and minute ventilation in all conditions, allowing to derive four relative parameters: The alignment of the two signals covered a fundamental role. In order to facilitate the process of identification and extraction of the correct signal window referring to a given position to be compared in the two instruments, subjects have been asked to perform a deep, big breath at the beginning of each test in each position. The comparison between the breath signals recorded by the Airgo™ device and the SensorMedics metabolic cart is based on the number of breaths in the same period and on the big-breath maneuver correspondence. After this phase, in order to obtain the correct number of breaths in the same time span, all Airgo™ values representing heartbeat artefacts or fake breaths have been filtered out according to the Airgo™ signal processing algorithm explained in Section 2.4. With the Airgo™ software it was possible to reconstruct two segmented contiguous breaths that are recognized activities by linking the minimum of the first breath to the maximum of the second. Thanks to the synchronization with the big breaths, the same number of breaths as in SensorMedics file in the same period was determined. However, when performing the alignment, a progressive alignment shift between the two measurements after the big breath was noticed. This was due to a temporal delay in the Airgo™ system's sampling process that led to a delay of about 3-4 s at the end of each position test. To overcome this problem and visualized the two sequences of values correctly, it was necessary to represent the outputs of Airgo™ and SensorMedics with respect to the number of breaths of each position test instead of the breath period. An example of synchronization of the amplitude outputs in a static position is shown in Figure 6 , while an example of synchronization of the respiratory rate outputs is shown in Figure 7 . In exercise test recordings, because of movement artefacts, noises coming from changes in posture, air losses through the mouthpiece caused by the increasing level of physical effort and the greater amount of breaths than the test at rest, the alignment process was based only on the initial big breath synchronization, so the final shift in alignment was not eliminated. An example is reported in Figure 8 , where another common problem is shown: for volumes higher than the tidal volume, Airgo™'s normalized amplitudes tend to underestimate the SensorMedics' normalized volume. In order to improve the effectiveness of the statistical analysis and to allow comparisons between subjects with different levels of maximum workload, the entire exercise test was divided in four different regions according to the increasing physical stress intensity: low intensity (""L""), medium intensity (""M""), high/maximum intensity (""H"" and ""I MAX "") and recovery phase (""RP""). To identify the maximum of exercise intensity for each subject, the SensorMedics' maximum value of normalized value of minute ventilation was considered as reference.

In order to improve the effectiveness of the statistical analysis and to allow comparisons between subjects with different levels of maximum workload, the entire exercise test was divided in four different regions according to the increasing physical stress intensity: low intensity (""L""), medium intensity (""M""), high/maximum intensity (""H"" and ""IMAX"") and recovery phase (""RP""). To identify the maximum of exercise intensity for each subject, the SensorMedics' maximum value of normalized value of minute ventilation was considered as reference. To equally divide the four regions, two points of reference were identified, one at one third and the second at two third of the normalized minute ventilation maximum value of the subject. Within the first three regions characterized by an increasing ventilation, four smaller sections constituted by at least twenty breaths were identified: the first one referring to the low intensity region (""L""), the second one referring to the medium intensity region (""M""), while the third and fourth referring to the high and maximum intensity region (""H"" and ""IMAX""). Because each subject reached a different maximum load according to his/her physical capacity, the four sections were centered differently from subject to subject. The section ""L"" was constituted by the central breaths of the first region, the section ""M"" by the central breaths of the second region; the section ""H"" by the central breaths of the third region and the section ""IMAX"" by the last twenty breaths of the exercise text track before the section ""RP"". In this last region, two other smaller sections were identified: the first one (""RP1"") containing at least ten breaths centered around the closest normalized minute ventilation central value within the ""H"" section and the second one (""RP2"") containing at least ten breaths centered around the closest ventilation central value within the ""M"" section. An example of this division into sections in the case of the minute ventilation can be seen in Figure 9 .

Since the test returned that data did not come from a normal distribution, a non-parametric statistical analysis has been conducted. To have a general overview of Airgo™'s estimate error in each position both during quiet breath and during the exercise test for each subject, relative error medians, interquartile ranges (IQRs) and limits of agreement (LOAs) were calculated for each parameter. Then, to find a significant difference between different positions and intensity levels (within the exercise test), the One-Way Kruskal-Wallis test has been conducted with a level of significance of p < 0.05. In the next paragraphs, box and whiskers plots of the differences between the two methods are reported for each position and for the two conditions (static postures and exercise test). An example of a Bland-Altman plot for a subject is reported to graphically show the agreement between the two instruments. The relative error median percentage, the interquartile range and the limits of agreement of the parameters during the test at rest and the exercise test are reported in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. Negative signs in the percentages stand for an understimation of the Airgo™'s computed parameters with respect to those of SensorMedics 2900, and negative values indicate the amount of the understimation. In the case of the respiratory rate, the overall relative error median percentage in all positions was of 0%, with the highest value of interquartile range of 15.0 in the supine position. The second best result was the overall relative error median percentage in the case of the normalized amplitude parameter: in fact, in the supine position the percentage of 0.8% was the lowest relative error for the test at rest after the results of the respiratory rate.

In particular, for horizontal positions the overall percentage values were lower (0.8%, 4.4% and 1.1%) compared to the seated position (9.0%) with the standing position percentage value standing between the two (6.8%). The normalized minute ventilation parameter, calculated as the product of tidal volume and respiratory rate, gained similar results to the normalized amplitude parameter and it was affected by similar errors in the same positions. To obtain representative error values for each respiratory parameter independently from the position, considering the mean error in all positions, the relative errors were 4.4% for normalized amplitude, 0% for respiratory rate, 4.2% for normalized ventilation and −0.3 for duty cycle. Table 3 . Exercise test and recovery, all intensities, all parameters. Aggregated data are expressed as relative error median percentage, interquartile range (IQR) and limits of agreement (LOAs), computed as ±1.96SD. IQR and LOAs are presented in brackets (IQR/LOAs). As shown in Figure 2 , Airgo™'s estimates tend to underestimate with increasing volumes and consequently with increasing ventilation during exercise, as was graphically shown in Figure 8 . In the normalized amplitude values reported in Table 3 , the relative error increased drastically from −11.1% at low intensity to −39.7% at maximum intensity. In the second recovery phase, the overall median relative error was −24.8%, a value that stands in between the low-intensity and medium-intensity values. This result was also more evident by looking at the overall normalized ventilation relative error medians. In this case, the respiratory rate was confirmed as the best estimate with an overall relative error median percentage of 0% in all physical effort conditions, while the duty cycle parameter had the highest error of −0.27 in the medium intensity level of the exercise. The results of One Way Kruskal-Wallis analysis are reported in Table 4 for the test at rest in different positions and for the exercise test at different intensity levels. For the test at rest, normalized amplitude, normalized ventilation and respiratory rate parameters were independent on position (p > 0.05). On the other hand, duty cycle was influenced by posture, with a statistically significant difference between standing and supine positions (p < 0.05). For the exercise test, the respiratory rate was the only parameter which resulted to be independent from different levels of exercise intensity (p > 0.05). In the cases of normalized amplitude (p < 0.01), normalized ventilation (p = 0.001) and duty cycle (p < 0.01) parameters, there was a significant effect of the intensity level of exercise on the error. In particular, the post hoc pairwise comparison highlighted that the first two parameters presented a statistically significant difference between conditions L and H (p < 0.05 for normalized amplitude and p < 0.01 for normalized ventilation), and conditions L and I MAX (p = 0.014 for normalized amplitude and p < 0.01 for normalized ventilation). The duty cycle presented, instead, a significant difference between M and RP1 conditions (p < 0.01), and M and RP2 conditions (p < 0.05). In Figure 10 , the four parameters in the different positions for all subjects are reported in boxplots, where the different positions of the test at rest are indicated with Roman numbers. The same analysis has been performed on the parameters during the exercise test and the result is shown in Figure 11 .  The Bland-Altman plot allows us to appreciate how much the system being validated differs from the reference system. The results obtained in the case of a healthy female subject (38 years old, 166 cm, 52 kg; same subject shown in Figures 6, 7 and 9 ) are reported in Figure 12 in the case of exercise and recovery tests for normalized ventilation and respiratory rate parameters. The obtained results are not significantly different from the results obtained in the previously illustrated representation methods. Focusing on normalized ventilation (Figure 12 , left), points tended to decrease with increasing ventilation, thus displaying the behavior of a proportional error. Respiratory rate (Figure 12 , right) showed a constant variability of the error.  The Bland-Altman plot allows us to appreciate how much the system being validated differs from the reference system.

The comparison of the Airgo™ device with the metabolic cart showed that the respiratory rate was the most accurate parameter, in all positions, for both rest and exercise tests in all conditions of physical effort: medians were always positioned on the zero error line with low dispersion around this value. Normalized amplitude and normalized ventilation showed similar trends and similar error changes both in different positions and during exercise. At rest, the overall error was small and remained almost constant in different positions, with the supine position characterized by better results compared to the others, even though this aspect did not have statistical significance. On the other hand, Airgo™'s underestimation of increasing breath volumes during exercise was confirmed and it was also more evident in normalized minute ventilation. Additionally, the recovery phase was characterized by a progressive reduction in absolute errors, which tend to assume initial median values. Figure 16 .

Additionally, the recovery phase was characterized by a progressive reduction in absolute errors, which tend to assume initial median values. In the results of the exercise tests, it was previously observed that in the second recovery phase, the overall median relative error was −24.8%, a value that stands between the low-intensity and medium-intensity values. The reason for this error is still a subject of research. Several possible explanations might have contributed separately or in combination to this result, however it is not possible to understand the magnitude of the contribution of each of these single explanations. The first one regards the pre-tensioned length of the girth elastic band obtained during the preparation phase of the test protocol: by cutting the band at a length slightly shorter than the real thoracic circumference (−7%) to ensure an effective fitting, it is likely that, for high volumes, the band reached the saturation region of the stretch metallic knit resistance qualitative curve in Figure 2 . In this case, the resistance changes with elongation fail to have a correct dynamics, exiting from the linear region. The second explanation is related to the different relative contributions of the abdomen and the chest wall to the breathing pattern according to the posture and the trunk position assumed during exercise. In fact, it is known from the literature that a progressively increased inclination of the trunk determines a progressive reduction in the chest wall contribution and a progressive increase in abdominal contribution to the tidal volume [24] , while the Airgo™ band only detects changes in circumference at the level of the abdominal rib cage, thus losing information related to the abdominal contribution. Finally, as can be seen in the box and whiskers plots, there was a constant underestimation of duty cycle in all positions at rest and also for all intensity levels during exercise. In particular, SensorMedics' values were always within an interval between 0.4 and 0.6, while Airgo™'s estimates were between 0.2 and 0.4. This means that, in the first case, inspiratory and expiratory time have a proportion of about 1:1, while in Airgo™'s duty cycle estimation, this proportion is about 1:2. This explains the error underestimation and it could be due to imperfections in the Airgo™ processing algorithm. Specifically, the ending of a breath is determined by computational means when the girth is either smaller than what it was when the breath began or when the girth is smaller than the maximum girth in a given breath cycle by a certain amount, as specified in the related patent. The fact that the end of expiration is detected by means of a threshold might cause errors in the precise identification of the minimum. In fact, the duty cycle is computed as described in Table 1 and an underestimation of inspiratory time with respect to expiratory (and total) time causes an underestimation of the duty cycle as well. The overall error remains constant between the test at rest and the exercise test, suggesting that duty cycle could be very accurate in both conditions when this issue is solved. The overall performance of Airgo™ in comparison with the SensorMedics metabolic cart was satisfactory and it must be noted that the research on this device, both from the point of view of the hardware and of the signal processing software, is still ongoing. The Airgo™ device is partially described in the US Patent number US201462007142P, title ""Breath volume monitoring system and method"" by David Kuller for Myair LLC. @story_separate@Respiratory rate is a vital sign used to monitor the progression of several illnesses, to predict adverse clinical events and to discriminate between patients at risk and stable patients. Given that Airgo™'s respiratory rate estimates had a good correspondence with the analyses performed with an instrument that can be considered the gold standard, it can be concluded that the Airgo™ device could be useful to monitor respiratory rate in a non-invasive and non-intrusive way during everyday activities and sleep. Applications of this device can be found in chronic respiratory diseases as well as acute pathologies, such as the novel COVID-19, where the respiratory rate is predictive of the worsening of the disease. Further research is needed on the estimations of tidal volume, minute ventilation and duty cycle, however the obtained results are encouraging and research works combining activity recognition and estimation of respiratory parameters are needed to assess the validity of the system in a non-controlled environment.","The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of Airgo™, a non-invasive wearable device that records breath, with respect to a gold standard. In 21 healthy subjects (10 males, 11 females), four parameters were recorded for four min at rest and in different positions simultaneously by Airgo™ and SensorMedics 2900 metabolic cart. Then, a cardio-pulmonary exercise test was performed using the Erg 800S cycle ergometer in order to test Airgo™’s accuracy during physical effort. The results reveal that the relative error median percentage of respiratory rate was of 0% for all positions at rest and for different exercise intensities, with interquartile ranges between 3.5 (standing position) and 22.4 (low-intensity exercise) breaths per minute. During exercise, normalized amplitude and ventilation relative error medians highlighted the presence of an error proportional to the volume to be estimated. For increasing intensity levels of exercise, Airgo™’s estimate tended to underestimate the values of the gold standard instrument. In conclusion, the Airgo™ device provides good accuracy and precision in the estimate of respiratory rate (especially at rest), an acceptable estimate of tidal volume and minute ventilation at rest and an underestimation for increasing volumes."
"With the prevalence of automated decision methods and machine learning methods, it is important to analyze the impact of learning and evaluate models not only with respect to traditional objectives such as reward or model accuracy, but also to account for the impact on individuals that interact with the system. Indeed, there are many studies highlighting algorithmic discrimination due to problems in the machine learning pipeline: imbalance in data [1] , learnt representations [2, 3] , choice of model proxies [4] , demographic group-dependent difference in error rates of the learned models [5, 6, 7] , to name a few. With rising ethical and legal concerns, addressing such issues has become urgent, specially as these impact critical societal decisions involving job opportunities and hiring. In 2014, it was estimated that 25% of the total workforce in the US was involved in some form of freelancing, and this number was predicted to grow to 40% by 2020 [8] . In reality, this percentage might be much higher, due to COVID-19 restrictions leading to increased work-from-home and changes in job opportunities [9, 10] . In online platforms however, there has been a strong evidence of bias observed in number of user reviews and user ratings 3 on completing jobs with significant correlations Figure 1 : Freelancer profiles on UPWORK with their past performance and corresponding reviews for ""fixedprice"" contracts. Contractors can access these profiles and allocate fixed-timed contracts with deadlines. with race, gender, location of work and length of profiles 4 [11] . Motivated by these problems in online contractual hiring, we study a theoretical framework for sequential resource allocation to workers, where the controller (decision maker) can enforce deadlines for each task's completion. Our key contribution is to quantify impact of reward maximization in terms of equality of opportunity for jobs and develop algorithms that can achieve a meaningful trade-off between these via online utility maximization. The challenge is to maximize total reward within a given time budget, while accounting for random completion times by workers from different groups and fairness in allocation. Formally, we consider K groups of individuals who can be hired sequentially for each task, i.e., at any point, exactly one individual can be hired. If an individual from group k ∈ [K] is chosen for the n-th task and given a contractual deadline t by the controller, he/she generates a random reward of R k,n if the task is completed by (random) time X k,n within deadline t. If the task is not completed by the deadline, the reward obtained by the controller is zero and the time until the deadline is wasted (i.e., yields 0 reward for the controller). Completion times and reward distributions are assumed group-dependent and i.i.d. across tasks. The objective of the controller is to maximize utility (trade-off between total reward and fair allocation) in the offline (known distributions) and online settings (unknown distributions) under a budget constraint on time. As we will show in this paper, controlled deadlines set are essential for optimal time-efficiency under the budget constraint. The ethical problems we are concerned with involve the rate of jobs allocated to different demographic groups and the deadlines imposed on these under reward maximization regimes [11] . Our sequential framework would also apply to other settings, for e.g., comparative clinical trials with varying follow-up durations as well as to server allocation in cloud computing where jobs are drawn from different application groups and must commit computational resources until a specific amount of time due to service level agreements (Section 2). We will often focus on the first application involving online contractual hiring, since fairness concerns are most naturally motivated in this domain. Given a time budget constraint B and the diverse random nature of completion time and reward pairs, the main question we consider is how to decide distribution of tasks and deadlines between different groups of people. Two potential extreme allocations are: (i) Reward-maximizing task allocation: The controller assigns all tasks to the most rewarding group to maximize the total reward within the given time budget. The other groups do not get any chance to receive tasks. (ii) Proportional task allocation: The controller completely ignores the reward distributions, and attempts to give equal time share to each group. In other words, each group receives a fraction of the tasks inversely proportional to their mean completion times. There is clearly a trade-off between the reward maximization and equal time-share considerations in continuous-time sequential task allocation, and well-chosen utility functions [12] can be helpful in modeling this in a unified way. In this paper, we consider a very general class of utility functions, which recovers broadly used fairness criteria such as proportional fairness, max-min fairness, reward maximization among many others [13, 14, 12] . The controller can determine her priorities in terms of notions of fairness and model the task allocation problem by choosing the utility function accordingly. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: 1. Incorporation of random completion time dynamics and fairness in allocation: In discretetime online learning models, each action is assumed to take a unit completion time, thus the random and diverse nature of task completion times, as required in many fundamental real-life applications, is ignored. In this work, we incorporate this aspect and develop a sequential learning framework in continuous time using tools from the theory of renewal processes and stochastic control. We show how controlled deadlines improve the time-efficiency in continuous-time decision processes. Moreover, this is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, that analyzes fair distribution policies in online contractual hiring. 2. Characterization of Approximately Optimal Offline Policies: As a consequence of the random and controlled task completion times, the optimal policy for fair resource allocation is PSPACEhard akin to unbounded stochastic knapsack problems. For tractability in design and analysis, we propose an approximation to the optimal offline policy based on Lagrange duality and renewal theory, and prove that it is asymptotically optimal. These approximate policies allocate tasks independently with respect to a fixed probability distribution. 3. Online learning for utility maximization: For utility maximization in an online setting with full information feedback, we develop a novel and low-computational-complexity online learning algorithm based on dynamic stochastic optimization methods for time averages, and show that it achievesÕ(B −1/2 ) regret for a time budget B. The optimal offline control policy in this paper is time-dependent, randomized and attempts to optimize time averages unlike the reward maximization problems in discrete-time problems. Despite these, the online learning algorithm we developed adapts to the randomness in completion time-reward pairs, and achieves optimal performance with vanishing regret at a fast rate. Related Work: The problem of fair resource allocation via utility maximization has been widely considered in economics and network management [15, 16, 17, 18] . The utility maximization approach to fair resource allocation in these papers predominantly deals with discrete-time systems, therefore the randomness and diversity in task completion times is completely ignored. Furthermore, these works either assume perfect knowledge of rewards and completion times prior to decisionmaking, or they assume the knowledge of statistics, therefore they do not incorporate online learning. The only continuous-time utility maximization approach to fair resource allocation is [19] , which assumes the knowledge of first-order statistics. Online learning under budget constraints has been considered under the scope of bandits with knapsacks [20, 21, 22] . In the classical bandits with knapsacks model, the objective is to maximize expected total reward under knapsack constraints in a stochastic setting. In [23] , an interrupt mechanism is employed to incorporate the continuous-time dynamics into the budget-constrained online learning model. Note that these works focus solely on reward maximization, therefore do not address the fair resource allocation problem. The bandits with knapsacks setting was extended to concave rewards and convex constraints in [24] , which assumes bounded cost and reward, and the deadline mechanism is not involved in decision-making, thus optimal time-efficiency in continuous time is not achieved. Our paper deviates from this line of work as it proposes a versatile and comprehensive framework for fairness, and incorporates continuous-time dynamics into the decisionmaking for time-efficiency. We include an extended discussion of related work in Appendix A.@story_separate@We consider the sequential and fair allocation of tasks to individuals from different groups, whose completion times and rewards randomly vary. This goal differs significantly from traditional online learning models that aim to maximize the expected total reward with unit completion times. Under this traditional setting, the controller's goal is to find and persistently select the reward-maximizing groups to allocate its tasks. As a consequence, the reward-maximization objective leads to the starvation of suboptimal groups, which causes unfairness amongst the groups with different statistical characteristics. Next, we provide a few motivating examples with group fairness requirements: • Contractual Hiring in Online Freelancing Platforms: Online freelancing sites like UPWORK host contractual workers (freelancers) that can be hired by ""contractors"" who require specific tasks to be completed. Each freelancer has a profile and performance on past tasks that can be learned by the contractors via ratings and reviews (see, typical profile in Figure 1 ). Fixed-timed contracts are popular on UPWORK, wherein contractors enforce a deadline by which the task must be completed otherwise the contract is terminated (i.e., there is no payment). Contractors can browse profiles and post a job to a selected set of freelancers with a deadline. However, there is a large literature documenting bias in online rating systems, which in turn impact job opportunities disparately [11, 25, 26] , thus making it critical to develop theory of online learning for such settings. • Server Allocation in Cloud Computing: An important application of our framework is online learning for fair resource allocation in cloud computing systems. In a very basic setting, a single server is sequentially allocated to tasks from one of K user groups, which exhibit similar execution time statistics and priority levels within each group. In many practical scenarios, the execution time of a task is unknown at the time decision [27, 28] , and exhibits a power-law behavior [29] , which necessitates a deadline mechanism for optimal time-efficiency [23] . In this setting, the objective of the controller is to allocate the server in an optimally fair way across the groups in a given time interval [0, B], depending on the completion time statistics and priority levels. Our work proposes a versatile framework to model fairness for this problem based on the concept of continuous-time utility maximization, and develops online learning algorithms to achieve the optimal performance with low regret in the absence of any statistical knowledge. More examples can be found in other domains, including multi-user wireless communication over fading channels (e.g., see [23] ), comparative clinical trials with optimal follow-up duration (e.g., see [30, 31] ), whereby the goal is to fairly share the limited resources between groups of users. Motivated by these examples, next we introduce an online learning framework that expands the traditional setting substantially to incorporate group fairness characteristics into its formulation. Suppose that there are K ≥ 1 groups of individuals that are available for serving tasks with different (and unknown) statistics. Specifically, if an individual from group k ∈ [K] = {1, 2, . . . , K} is chosen for the n-th task, he/she takes X k,n units of completion time for successful completion, and a reward of R k,n (t) = R k,n I{X k,n ≤ t} is obtained t time units after the initiation where R k,n is a positive random variable and R k,n (t) ∈ [0, R max (t)] a.s. for some finite constant R max (t) > 0. Thus, the random reward R k,n is gathered only if the task is completed. For example, in the server allocation application, a group-k task of random size R k,n yields a reward (throughput) R k,n (t) = R k,n I{X k,n ≤ t} only upon successful completion. We assume that (X k,n , R k,n (t)) is independent and identically distributed (iid) over n, and independent across different groups k. Note that the completion time X k,n and reward R k,n can be correlated, for example, in the server allocation example, the completion time X k,n and size R k,n of a task are positively correlated [32] . We assume that each task has a positive completion time, i.e., X k,n > 0 almost surely for all k, n. Before the n-th task begins, the controller makes two decisions: the group G n ∈ [K] of the individual that will be assigned the task, and a deadline T n ∈ T, where T ⊂ R + is the decision set. If the task is not completed by the selected deadline, the service is interrupted without collecting any reward. In many applications, the deadlines are chosen within a discrete set (e.g., days/months in contractual hiring or time-slots in server allocation), thus we assume a finite decision set T = {t 1 , t 2 , . . . , t L } with t l < ∞ for all l in this paper. The sequential task allocation continues until a given time budget B > 0 is exceeded, therefore, the completion time of a task is as important as the reward. To describe this process mathematically, let H k,n−1 denote the available feedback for group k, and H n−1 = ∪ k∈[K] H k,n−1 denote the history before making a decision for task n. For a given time budget B > 0, a causal policy π = {π 1 , π 2 , . . .} sequentially makes two decisions π n = (G n , T n ) ∈ [K] × T for each task n based on the history H k−1 , where G n is the chosen group and T n is the assigned deadline. Under a policy π, the number of initiated tasks is the following first-passage time: which is a random and controlled stopping time. Moreover, the reward rate of any user type k is: If R k,n (t) = I{X k,n ≤ t}, i.e., each task completion yields a unit reward, then r π k (B) simply denotes the task completion rate (i.e., throughput) of group k individuals in the time interval [0, B]. Note that designing strategies that aim to maximize the total reward rate in (2) will lead to the persistent selection of the group with the highest reward rate at the cost of starvation of all the rest (see [23] ). In order to address group fairness considerations, we propose a continuous-time online learning framework based on the utility maximization concept that is used effectively in the fair resource allocation domain (e.g., see [16] ). Specifically, for a given continuously-differentiable, concave and monotonically increasing utility function U k : R → R, we let the utility of group k under a policy π be given by U k r π k (B) . Then, the total utility under a policy π is defined as: The optimum utility over a class of policies Π, and the regret for a given π ∈ Π are, respectively: Note that, due to the monotonically increasing and concave nature of utility functions, allocating the tasks always to the most rewarding group is not a good choice, because the same amount of time could yield a higher utility for another group because of the diminishing return property of concave functions. A particularly important set of utility functions is captured by the α-fair class, given next. Definition 1 (α-Fair Allocation). For any given α > 0 and weight Resource allocation by using these utility functions is called α-fair resource allocation. This class is attractive since it includes as special cases proportional fairness, minimum potential delay fairness, reward maximization and max-min fairness [12] . Note that a simpler version of the sequential maximization problem in (3) with linear utility functions over all causal policies is called an unbounded knapsack problem, and it is PSPACE-hard even in the case of known statistics [33, 20] . Therefore, the optimal causal policy for the problem in (3) has a very high computational complexity even in the offline setting, which makes it intractable for online learning. For tractability in design and analysis, we consider a class of simple policies that allocate tasks in an i.i.d. randomized way according to a fixed probability distribution over groups, and show its efficiency in this section. Definition 2 (Stationary Randomized Policies). Let P be a fixed probability distribution over [K]×T. A stationary randomized policy (SRP) π = π(P ) makes a randomized decision independently according to P for every task until the time budget B is depleted. In other words, under the SRP π(P ), we have P π n = (k, t) = P (k, t), ∀n ≤ N π (B), for all (k, t) ∈ [K] × T. We denote the class of all stationary randomized policies as Π S . Proposition 1 (Asymptotic optimality of SRP). There exists a probability distribution P such that the stationary randomized policy π(P ) is asymptotically optimal over all causal policies as B → ∞. The proof of Proposition 1 can be found in Appendix B. In the following, we characterize the total utility under π(P ) by providing tight bounds. Proposition 2. Let P be any given probability distribution over [K] × T. Then, the reward per unit time for group k under the stationary randomized policy π(P ) is as follows: Consequently, the total utility under the stationary randomized policy π(P ) is bounded as follows: We include the complete proof of Proposition 2 in Appendix B. The key idea is that under an SRP, the total reward of a group k is a regenerative process. Then, by using the theory of stopped random walks for regenerative processes, the reward per unit time under π(P ) is found as ρ k (P ), and the upper bound for the total utility is found by using Lorden's inequality [34] and concavity of U k . Proposition 2 emphasizes the significance of the reward per unit time ρ k (P ). In conjunction with Proposition 1, this suggests that using a probability distribution that maximizes the limiting total utility would be an effective offline approximation. Definition 3 (Optimal Stationary Randomized Policy). Let P be a probability distribution defined as P ∈ arg max P k∈[K] U k ρ k (P ) . Then, the optimal SRP π makes a selection independently for every task according to P : An interesting question regarding P is the choice of deadline policy for each group. The following proposition characterizes the optimal deadline policy under π , and yields a significant simplification in finding the optimal policy by reducing the size of the search space. Proposition 3 (Optimal Deadline Policy). For any k, the optimal probability distribution P makes a deterministic deadline decision for group k, that is, |{t ∈ T : P (k, t) > 0}| ≤ 1. For any k, we denote t * k ∈ T as the (unique) optimal deadline for group k such that P (k, t * k ) > 0. The detailed proof of Prop. 3 can be found in Appendix C. As we will see later, we can explicitly characterize the optimal deadline for a broad class of utility functions used for the so-called α-fair allocations. In the following, we use Prop. 2 to characterize the performance of the optimal SRP. Proposition 4 (Optimal Total Utility). For any group k, let t * k ∈ T be the (unique) optimal deadline by Prop be the reward per processing time for group k; and be the fraction of time budget allocated to group k under π(P ). Then, for any SRP π(P ), the total utility is bounded as where the upper bound is achieved by the probability distribution that satisfies ϕ k = 1 The proof of Proposition 4 follows from Lagrange duality and Prop. 3, and can be found in Appendix D. Note that the above analysis is very general in the sense that it holds for any set of utility functions {U k : R → R : k ∈ [K]} that are continuously differentiable and concave. In the following, we apply the results to the class of α-fair allocations (cf. Definition 1) and discuss their implications. Proposition 5 (α-Fair Resource Allocation in Continuous Time). For any group k, the optimal E[min{X k,1 ,t}] be the reward per processing time and µ k = E[min{X k,1 , t * k }] be the mean processing time for group k. Then, for any α > 0, we have the following results for α-fair utility functions: where the optimum probability distribution P * k and the optimum fraction of time budget ϕ k allocated to group k are, respectively, given by: To gain a clear understanding of the notion of α-fairness, we consider the following special cases. Corollary 1. For any given set of parameters {w k > 0 : k ∈ [K]}, we have the following results for continuous-time α-fair resource allocation problem for various α > 0 values. (i) Proportional fairness: In this case, we have lim α→1 U k (x) = w k log(x) for all k. Let µ k = E[min{X k,1 , t * k }] be the mean processing time for group k. Then, the optimum utility is achieved by the probability distribution P (k, (ii) Reward maximization: If α = 0, we have U k (x) = ω k x for all k. Let k * = arg max k∈[K] w k r * k be the group with highest weighted reward rate. Then, the optimal probability distribution is Note that optimal deadline t * k for any group k is chosen so as to maximize the reward per processing time of group k. Under proportional fairness (α → 1), the controller distributes the time budget proportional to group weights, i.e., ϕ k = w k / j w k , which reduces to equal time-sharing under uniform weights. To achieve this, the controller allocates tasks with probability inversely proportional to the mean processing time µ k . Under reward maximization (α = 0), the controller allocates the entire time budget B to a single group that yields the highest reward per processing time to maximize the expected total reward, i.e., ϕ k = I{k = k * }. As such, the trade-off between reward maximization and equal (i.e., reward-insensitive) time-sharing is modeled by α-fairness for any α ∈ [0, 1). Further, the α-fair utility maximization framework includes max-min fairness (α → ∞) and minimum potential delay fairness (α = 2) as subcases. In the previous section, we provided key results on the asymptotically optimal approximations to the offline utility maximization problem. In this section, we will build on these to attack the online learning problem for continuous-time fair allocation. In particular, we will propose a novel lightweight online learning algorithm for the fair resource allocation problem based on Lagrangian duality, and show that it achieves vanishing regret at rateÕ(B −1/2 ). Feedback model: We assume a delayed full-information feedback model where the completion time and reward of all groups for task n are revealed to the controller at stage n + τ for some delay τ ≥ 1. This assumption holds approximately for our target applications. In freelancing platforms, there are often multiple contractors that hire freelancers for various tasks. It is often possible to get full information on various freelancers due to employment by other companies and their reviews can serve as the feedback for the controller. Competitions hosting websites like TOPCODER have also recently been catering to businesses who need fast-prototyping using freelancers. In their business model, a controller might invest in a few topcoders at a time, however, she can potentially get access to updated rankings (quality and time to complete tasks) via topcoder competitions over time. In server applications such as Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure as well, although a controller might be optimizing operations on a local set of servers, they can request task performance data from a centralized server or a scheduler after a delay in time [35] . This feedback model already presents with technical challenges due to random completion times, as we discuss next. In order to design the online learning algorithm, let us define, for any (k, t) ∈ [K] × T, the empirical estimates of the mean completion time and reward after n stages, respectively, as Definition 4 (OLUM Algorithm). For any k, let Q k,0 = 1 and Q k,i be defined recursively as follows: where the auxiliary variable γ k (i) = U k −1 Q k,i /V , where V > 0 is a design choice. Then, for the task n, the OLUM Algorithm, denoted by π OLUM , makes the following decision: Upon observing the corresponding feedback, the controller updates Q k,n+1 via (6). Interpretation: The OLUM Algorithm aims to maximize the time-average reward weighted with Q k,n at each round. Note that for any k ∈ [K], if the sequence Q k,n gets very big, then its reward rate is much smaller than the optimal value, thus the controller tends to select that group. In other words, the magnitude of Q k,n is a measure of the unfairness that group k has endured by stage n. The algorithm is designed so as to balance the weights Q k,n to maximize the total utility. In the following theorem, we prove regret bounds for the OLUM Algorithm. Theorem 1 (Regret bounds for OLUM). For any V > 0 and constant delay τ , the regret under π OLUM is bounded as The proof is based on PAC bounds and stochastic dual optimization, and can be found in Appendix E. We implemented the OLUM Algorithm on a fair resource allocation problem with K = 2 groups. In the application domains that we considered in Section 2, the task completion times naturally follow a power-law distribution. For example, in the server allocation example, empirical studies indicate that the distribution of job execution times can be accurately approximated by a Pareto(1, γ) distribution with exponent γ ∈ (0, 2) [36] . Similarly, for the contractual online hiring setting, creativity of individuals has been shown to follow a Pareto(1, γ) distribution with exponent γ > 1, where γ is dependent on the field of expertise [37] . Motivated by these applications, we consider the following group statistics: • Group 1: X k,n ∼ Pareto(1, 1.2) and R k,n (t) = X 0.6 k,n · I{X k,n ≤ t} • Group 2: X k,n ∼ Pareto(1, 1.4) and R k,n (t) = X 0.2 k,n · I{X k,n ≤ t} The reward per processing time as a function of the deadline is shown in Figure 2 . Note that the optimal deadline improves the reward per unit processing time. For this setting, we implemented the '20 Draft/reward-rate.pdf OLUM Algorithm with parameter V = 20, and considered α-fair resource allocation problems with various α values. In Figure 2 , we present the simulation results for ϕ 2 , i.e., the average fraction of time budget B allocated to Group-2 individuals, under the OLUM Algorithm. For these experiments, we chose w k = 1 for k = 1, 2 and ran the OLUM Algorithm for 1000 trials for each set. Note that the optimal reward per processing time of Group-1 individuals is higher than that of Group-2 individuals, thus Group-1 is chosen for reward maximization. Under proportional fairness, the time budget is equally distributed between Group-1 and Group-2 individuals. We observe from Figure 2 that the OLUM Algorithm converges to the optimal operating points very fast, which verifies the theoretical results we presented. Our work develops the theory of fair online learning, specifically analyzing the impact of rewardmaximizing allocation policies on opportunities for different groups of people. Our proposal analyzes the trade-offs across various allocation policies (ranging from profit maximizing to equal opportunity for all), thus highlighting the choice of objectives that the controllers should carefully consider. This work does not have any foreseeable negative ethical or societal impact. Fair resource allocation via utility maximization has been widely studied in economics [38, 39, 18] , mechanism design [40] , network management [15, 41, 16, 12, 42] among many other fields. Particularly, logarithmic utility maximization was introduced in [38] for the ""Nash bargaining solution"" to a bargaining game among multiple players over the allocation of a shared resource, and it was used in the management of communication networks in [41] . As a unifying framework, the class of α-fair (also known as ""isoelastic"") utility functions was proposed for fair allocation in economics in [39] . The main methodology for fair resource allocation in time-varying dynamical systems, akin to the system considered here, is Lyapunov drift analysis. Lyapunov drift has been used as a fundamental design and analysis tool in many problems including the wireless scheduling problem [43, 44] , fair resource allocation among competing users [16, 12] , stochastic game theory [45] . Based on Lyapunov-drift methods, stochastic dynamic optimization algorithms by using the so-called drift-plus-penalty method were widely used in queueing and networking problems (see [46] and references therein). The existing Lyapunov optimization methods are predominantly opportunistic, which means that the random quantities (such as completion time, reward, system state) arrive prior to the decision-making at each stage, or they assume the knowledge of the first-and second-order statistics of these random quantities. These assumptions are not satisfied in many applications as we discussed in Section 1, therefore the controller must learn the statistics so as to maximize the objective function, such as the total utility. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first learning theory approach to the fair resource allocation problem based on Lyapunov drift. Even in the offline optimization setting, the Lyapunov optimization methods are predominantly in discrete-time setting, i.e., each action takes a unit time. The only continuous-time utility maximization approach to fair resource allocation is [19] , which assumes the knowledge of first-order statistics. Our paper improves some of the results of this paper in the offline optimization scenario (e.g., simplified decision rules, finite-time performance bounds), and extends these results for the online learning problem. The online learning problem under budget constraints has been considered in the bandits with knapsacks (BwK) framework [20] . In this extension of the classical stochastic bandit model, each action consumes a random amount of a resource from a common budget and yields a random reward, where the controller aims to maximize the expected total reward by until a resource is completely depleted. BwK model has been considered under various dynamics [20, 47, 48, 21] . In [23] , an interrupt/deadline mechanism is employed to incorporate the continuous-time dynamics into the budget-constrained online learning model. For a detailed discussion of the BwK and its extensions, please refer to [22] . The original BwK models study the reward maximization problem. In [24] , the authors consider an online learning setting where the objective is to maximize a concave function subject to convex constraints. In [24] , the decision-making process continues for a fixed number of stages, and the constraints are not always satisfied unlike our model. Instead, the distance to the constraint set, as well as the regret, is shown to vanish in expectation under the proposed learning algorithms, which require solving linear programs at each stage. Another crucial difference is that the deadline mechanism for improving time-efficiency is not incorporated into the decision in [24] . Our paper deviates from this line of work as it proposes a versatile and comprehensive framework for fairness, and incorporates continuous-time dynamics into the decision-making for time-efficiency under strict time constraints. To solve this problem, we propose a learning algorithm with low computational complexity, and prove its efficiency. The design and analysis methodology we followed in this paper based on Lyapunov optimization can be used in many other problem models. Proof of Proposition 2. Fix any (group, deadline) decision (k, t) ∈ [K] × T, and consider the stationary policy π = π(P ) with an arbitrary probability distribution P . Let the number of (k, t) decisions in [0, B] be defined as I{π n = (k, t)}. Since each decision is made independently according to the same probability distribution, the number of tasks between two consecutive tasks for which the decision is (k, t) is iid, which implies that N (k,t) π (B) is a regenerative process [34] . Therefore, we can compute the total reward gathered from tasks for which the decision-pair is (k, t) by using renewal theory. In order to accomplish this, we will compute the mean length of a regenerative cycle for each decision (k, t), and then use the renewal theory for tight bounds. Without loss of generality, consider a regenerative cycle from the beginning (time 0) to the completion of the first task where the decision-pair is (k, t), thus each regenerative cycle contains exactly one task for which the decision-pair is (k, t). Then, for the random variable M = sup{n ≥ 0 : π n (P ) = (k, t)}, the number of tasks in a regenerative cycle is M + 1 ∼ Geo P (k, t) . This construction implies that {M = 0} = {π 1 (P ) = (k, t)} and {M = m} = m i=1 {π i (P ) = (k, t)} ∩ {π M +1 (P ) = (k, t)} for m > 1 under the stationary randomized policy π(P ). Therefore, the length of the regenerative cycle (i.e., the time interval in which there is exactly one completed task with decision-pair (k, t)) is as follows: where x ∧ y = min{x, y} for any two real numbers x, y. Note that Y is a stopped random walk with non-i.i.d. increments and a controlled stopping time M + 1. We will compute the expectation of this quantity first. By iterated expectation, we have the following equality: Note that for any n 0 ≥ 0, we have: for all n ≤ n 0 . Therefore, we have the following identity: where µ(k, t) = E[X k,1 ∧ t]. Thus, we have the following: from (7). Since M + 1 ∼ Geo(P (k, t)), we have E[M ] = 1 p(k,t) − 1. Substituting this into the above identity, we find the expected length of a regenerative cycle under π(P ) as follows: In summary, a decision-pair (k, t) is chosen once in a cycle of Y time units, and yields a reward R k,n (t) under the stationary randomized policy π(P ). Having specificed mean length of a regenerative cycle and mean reward, we can now compute the reward rate (i.e., reward per unit time) for a decision-pair (k, t) under π(P ) as follows: . As an immediate consequence, the reward per unit time for group k under π(P ) is as follows: As a consequence of the elementary renewal theorem [49] , the total reward for group k under π(P ) in [0, B] is Bρ k (P ) + o(B). In order to get tight bounds, we use Lorden's inequality to obtain the following inequalities: I{π n = (k, t)}R k,n (t) ≤ Bρ k (P ) + C(k, t), for a constant C(k, t) < ∞ since V ar(X k,n ∧ t) < ∞ and V ar(R k,n (t)) < ∞ for all t ∈ T [34] . Therefore, Since U k is continuously differentiable and concave, we have the following result: which concludes the proof. Proof of Proposition 1. First, we will show an approximation to the optimization problem in (3) based on Jensen's inequality. For any k ∈ [K], n ≥ 1 and a causal policy π for choosing (G n , T n , (γ k,n ) k∈[K] ), let X πn,n = min{X Gn,n , T n }, Z πn,n = min{X Gn,n , Y πn,m,n = min{X Gn,n , T n }γ m,n − R m,n (T n )I{G n = m}, ∀m ∈ [K]. Let U * be the solution to the following optimization problem: ≤ 0, ∀m = 1, 2, . . . , K. (12) where the maximization is over Π A , the set of all causal policies. Then, we have the following result: Proof. First, under any policy π ∈ Π A , the following holds by the definition of N π (B): Since X πn,n is bounded for all n, we have the following: By using the asymptotic equality in (13) , continuity of U k , and a direct application of the extended Jensen's inequality (see Lemma 7.6 in [46] ), we have lim B→∞ OPT Π A (B) = U * . This enables us to convert the utility maximization problem into a constrained optimization for time-averages. Now, we will prove the following: Since U * is optimal asymptotic total utility over Π A ⊃ Π S , we have the following inequality: By using (13) , a direct application of Lemma 1 in [19] implies that there exists an SRP π(P 0 ) that achieves U * . Proposition 2 implies that for any P and B > 0. Thus, we have: which implies U * = max P k U k (ρ k (P )). Let µ(k, t) = E[min{X k,1 , t}] and θ(k, t) = E[R k,1 (t)]. For the optimal distribution P , let is an increasing function of x, P k is the solution to the following optimization problem: Let V * be the optimum solution of (14) , and V (P k ) = t P k (t)θ(k, t) − V * t P k (t)µ(k, t) + C k . Then, the following optimization problem is equivalent to (3): which, in turn, yields P k . For any t ∈ T, we have ∂V ∂P k (t) = θ(k, t) − V * µ(k, t). Let By the optimality of P k , if P k (t) > 0, then we must have ∂V (P k )/∂P k (t) = d * , which further implies that Let t 1 ≤ t 2 ≤ . . . ≤ t m be the set of deadlines such that P k (t i ) > 0. There exists a β ∈ [0, 1] such that the following holds: In conjunction with (16) , this implies that: Hence, we have shown that P k makes a randomization between at most two deadlines, which simplifies (15) considerably as a function of a single variable β ∈ [0, 1]. Rewriting (15) in terms of β and taking the derivative with respect to β ∈ [0, 1], we observe that the objective function is either monotonically decreasing or increasing with β. Therefore, P k has only one non-zero element, i.e., the deadline decision is made deterministically for group k. By Proposition 3, for each group k, there is a unique optimal deadline t * k . Let , be the reward per processing time for group k under the optimal deadline selection. Then, by Proposition 2, we can express the reward per unit time as follows: , is the fraction of time allocated to group k under π(P ). Note that for any P , { ϕ k (P ) : k ∈ [K]} defines a probability distribution in the K-dimensional simplex. Therefore, by Proposition 2, the asymptotically optimal utility is the solution to the following optimization problem: The Lagrangian function associated with (17) is as follows: Since U k is a monotonically increasing and continuously differentiable function for all k, by solving ∂L ∂ ϕ k = 0, we obtain ϕ k = (U k ) −1 (λ/r * k ). As U k is concave for all k, the proof follows by applying KKT conditions. The proof of Theorem 1 consists of two steps. In the first step, we analyze the performance of the OLUM Algorithm for the constrained optimization of time averages for any number of trials N by using a drift-based dual ascent optimization methodology. In the second step, we show that the number of tasks processed in [0, B] is O(B) with high probability to prove the regret result. The following concentration inequality will be used extensively throughout the proof. Lemma 2 ( [50, 23] ). Let X n and R n be two sub-Gaussian random processes with means E[X] > 0, E[R], and parameters σ 2 X and σ 2 R , respectively. Then, for any ∈ (0, E[X]), we have the following: Note that any bounded random variable Z ∈ [0, a] is sub-Gaussian with parameter σ 2 = a 2 /4 [51] . As we are dealing with bounded min{X k,n , t} and R k,n (t), Lemma 2 is an essential result for the proofs in this section. In the second lemma, we provide an upper bound for the expectation of the dual variables Q n = (Q 1,n , Q 2,n , . . . , Q K,n ). Lemma 3. Consider the dual variables defined in (6) under the OLUM Algorithm, and without loss of generality assume Q k,0 = 1 for all k. Then, we have the following bound for any n ≥ 1: for any V > 0 and ∈ 0, min k,t E[R k,n (t) . Proof. For any ∈ 0, min k,t E[R k,n (t) , let Then, we have E[ k Q k,n+1 − k Q k,n |Q n ∈ A] ≤ − . Also, note that Q k,n+1 − Q k,n is bounded almost surely, i.e., sub-Gaussian. Thus, Theorem 2.3 in [52] implies the tail bounds for k Q k,n , which implies the result via E[XI{X > a}] = aP(X > a) + ∞ a P(X > x)dx. Step 1: Recall the equivalent form of the utility maximization problem in Lemma 1. In this step, we will prove the following result under the OLUM Algorithm: for any N . This will be done by showing that the OLUM Algorithm achieves -optimal Lyapunov drift with high probability for each decision, thus achieves optimality fast as a result of the Lyapunov drift methodology. For details on Lyapunov optimization, refer to [46] . For any group k ∈ [K], let X * k,n = min{X Gn,n , t * k }, . Note that these are the random variables in Lemma 1 under the optimal deadline t * k for each group k. The proof relies on a novel online learning approach based on drift-based optimization techniques. In this methodology, the dual variables Q n as defined in (6) summarize how much the constraint is violated in the past. At stage n, given the vector of dual variables Q n , we have the drift-plus-penalty ratio (DPPR), which is defined as follows: The optimal algorithm therefore, aims to minimize the DPPR to achieve optimality. Let the terms in DPPR related to the auxiliary variables γ m,n be denoted as: Therefore, the DPPR can be written as follows: The classical drift-based stochastic optimization techniques either assume the knowledge of the first-order moments in Ψ n (k, G n ), or they observe the outcomes for the completion of task n prior to the decision. However, in online learning, since we have no prior knowledge of the mean values E[R m,n (t * m )] and E[min{X k,n , t * k }], we define the empirical reward-per-processing-time as follows: where n − τ is the number of samples available. Similarly, let The deadline is chosen so as to maximize the reward per processing time: r k,n = max t∈T r k,n (t). Let δ k (t) = max t r k (t ) − r k (t) and δ(t) = min (k,t):δ k (t)>0 δ k (t). By using Lemma 2, it can be shown that T n = t * Gn with probability at least 1 − e −nΩ δ 2 (t) , i.e., the optimal deadline for the chosen group G n is selected with high probability. With this deadline-selection policy, the empirical drift-plus-penalty ratio (e-DPPR) is defined as follows: The OLUM Algorithm as defined in Definition 4 is based on minimizing the e-DPPR in (25) . The auxiliary variables in the OLUM Algorithm is chosen to maximize ψ n (γ n , Q n ) over γ n , and the group decision is independent of the choice of the auxiliary variables given Q n . The following proposition quantifies the approximation error for using the e-DPPR in the decisionmaking as a surrogate for the DPPR in the optimization. Proposition 6. For any given ∈ (0, µ * ), we have the following inequality for the DPPR under the OLUM Algorithm: where E[h(Q n )] = c 1 e −c2n 2 for some constants c 1 , c 2 > 0 and The proof of Proposition 6 relies on the concentration result presented in Lemma 2 and a PAC-type bound: let k be a group such that Ψ n (k, Q n ) > min j Ψ n (j, Q n ) + δ for any δ > 0 given Q n . Then, P G n = k Q n ≤ P Ψ n (k, Q n ) − Ψ n (k, Q n ) > δ/2 Q n + P Ψ n (k n , Q n ) − Ψ n (k n , Q n ) > δ/2 Q n , where k n = arg min j Ψ n (j, Q n ). Then, a straightforward application of Lemma 2 and union bound (over suboptimal groups) with δ = · O( k Q k,n ) for > 0 yield the result. We have the following lemma, which will be key in the analysis of the learning algorithm. Lemma 4 ([46] ). Let L(q) = 1 2 K m=1 q 2 m be the quadratic Lyapunov function, and ∆(Q n ) = E[L(Q n+1 ) − L(Q n )|Q n ], be the Lyapunov drift. Then, we have the following bound on the Lyapunov drift for the problem (12): for some constant D > 0 under the OLUM Algorithm. From Proposition 6 and Lemma 4 with = n = 2(1+r * ) µ * β log(n) n for β > 2, we have the following result: ∆(Q n ) − V E[min{X Gn,n , T n } k U k (γ k,n )|Q n ] ≤ D + E[min{X Gn,n , T n }|Q n ] − V U * + n k Q k,n + E[h(Q n )|Q n ]O(K · n) . (28) where D > 0 is a constant, and the RHS holds since there exists an optimal stationary randomized policy for (12) which satisfies: Summing the above over n = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1, dividing by N , and rearranging terms, we have the following inequality: The second question we had was how much the constraint in (12) is violated. From the update of the dual variables (6), we have the following: Summing the above over all n = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1, we have: Y Gn,k,n . Thus, we have: By Lemma 3, the following inequality holds: Hence, by choosing V = Θ( N/ log(N )), we show that the objective is achieved with O( log(N )/N ) gap, and the constraint is satisfied at a rate O(1/ N log(N )). Step 2. In this step, we will show that the decision-making process continues for N π (B) = Θ(B) stages with high probability, which will conclude the proof. For any B > 0, let n 0 (B) = 2B/µ min . Then, under any causal policy π, we have the following bound: where U * = OPT Π S (B) + O(1/B) is the optimal utility in Lemma 1, µ * = max k E[X k,n ], and (33) holds since N π (B) n=1 X Gn,n ≥ B by definition. In order to prove (34) , first note that  Since {N π (B) > n} ⊂ { n i=1 X πi,i < B} by definition and E[ X πi,i |H i ] ≥ µ * > 0 for all i, we have: P(N π (B) > n) = P( n i=1 X πi,i < B) ≤ e −nΩ (1) , for all n > n 0 (B) by Azuma-Hoeffding inequality [51] , which implies that n 0 (B) is a highprobability upper bound for N π (B) under any causal policy π. In other words, the decision-making process continues for at most n 0 (B) turns with high probability since each action depletes a positive amount from the time budget B. Consequently, we have Using this result and rearranging the terms in (35) , we obtain the inequality in (34) . Furthermore, the constraints are satisfied at rate O(V /B) for all groups. Therefore, by using the result of Step 1 with N = n 0 (B) and noting that n 0 (B)/B = Θ(1), we conclude that REG π Π S (B) = O( log(B)/B).@story_separate@In this paper, we proposed a versatile and comprehensive framework for continuous-time online resource allocation with fairness considerations, and proposed a no-regret learning algorithm for this problem in a delayed full-information feedback model. Note that although the full-information feedback is available in many application scenarios, there are cases in which the controller does not have an access to full feedback, thus a mechanism that incorporates bandit feedback is required. The online learning framework introduced in this paper can be extended to bandit feedback. One way to achieve this might be to replace the empirical estimates with upper confidence bounds in the OLUM Algorithm, which makes the analysis even more complicated. We leave the design and analysis of bandit algorithms in this setting as a future work.","The theory of discrete-time online learning has been successfully applied in many problems that involve sequential decision-making under uncertainty. However, in many applications including contractual hiring in online freelancing platforms and server allocation in cloud computing systems, the outcome of each action is observed only after a random and action-dependent time. Furthermore, as a consequence of certain ethical and economic concerns, the controller may impose deadlines on the completion of each task, and require fairness across different groups in the allocation of total time budget $B$. In order to address these applications, we consider continuous-time online learning problem with fairness considerations, and present a novel framework based on continuous-time utility maximization. We show that this formulation recovers reward-maximizing, max-min fair and proportionally fair allocation rules across different groups as special cases. We characterize the optimal offline policy, which allocates the total time between different actions in an optimally fair way (as defined by the utility function), and impose deadlines to maximize time-efficiency. In the absence of any statistical knowledge, we propose a novel online learning algorithm based on dual ascent optimization for time averages, and prove that it achieves $\tilde{O}(B^{-1/2})$ regret bound."
"Ever since sociology has been established as a scientific discipline, religion has been studied as a basic social institution, a central phenomenon of social life and an influential core for many cultures. Religiosity can also be an essential factor shaping physicians' attitude towards patients (Pawlikowski et al., 2012; Wenger & Carmel, 2004) . Unsurprisingly, religion has been defined as an important predictor of volunteering, and it is now well documented that both religious beliefs and practices influence volunteers' motivations. Moreover, while research shows that the importance of helping others is more common among religious people, it has also been found that members of religious congregations volunteer more This is important, especially during the current health crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, because volunteering constitutes the chief example of civic consciousness and responsibility (Chawłowska et al., 2021; Drexler et al., 2020; Gallagher & Schleyer, 2020; Gouda et al., 2020; Miller et al., 2020; Soled et al., 2020; Thomson & Lovegrove, 2020) . This is especially so in countries like Poland, which struggle with the problem of a decreasing number of health professionals (Eurostat, 2020a) , or in countries that have experienced care staff shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic (Rasmussen et al., 2020; Stokes, 2020) . Thus, ever since the COVID-19 struck and an epidemic was announced by the Polish government, medical universities have started encouraging future healthcare professionals to volunteer and support the fight against the pandemic. Consequently, even though all universities in the country were closed, lectures were moved online and all medical students were pulled out of the hospital's, thousands of students of medicine, nursing, pharmacy, medical analytics, medical rescue and physiotherapy volunteered and started helping in local hospitals, emergency units, hospital pharmacies, sanitary-epidemiological stations, the university's diagnostic laboratory and local call centres. Thus, this paper aims to describe the impact of religiosity on the motivations to volunteer among future healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak in Poland.@story_separate@This study was conducted between 5 May and 30 June 2020 among students enrolled in Poznan University of Medical Sciences (PUMS), Poland using an online questionnaire posted on an online platform. The questionnaire consisted of three sections, the first asked questions regarding students' demographic characteristics, the second section gathered information on students' reactions to the pandemic and anxieties related to voluntary service, and the last section included questions regarding students' motivations to volunteer. In this part, respondents were asked to rank on a scale of 1-5 the reasons they volunteered, and the mean values were computed for these variables based on all responses. The questionnaire was elaborated according to the guidelines of the European Statistical System (Eurostat, 2005) . After submitting an application to the University Student Council Board (USCB) to obtain permission to complete the study, an online focus-group of five students and one sociologist was organised to discuss the list of questions regarding students' volunteering drawn from a literature review to develop the standardised questionnaire. The questionnaire was then assessed by four members of the USCB, one physician and one sociologist and pre-tested via an online platform with another five students to reformulate the five questions. After the pilot study, the final version of the questionnaire was evaluated by an additional three external reviewers: two students and one sociologist and received approval from the USCB. Additionally, ethics approval and research governance approval were obtained from the PUMS Bioethics Committee (KB-831/20). Finally, the questionnaire was posted on an online platform and distributed to students engaged in voluntary service. All students received an invitation letter, and informed consent was obtained from all respondents enrolled in the study. The data collected in the questionnaires were verified and checked for completeness, quality and consistency and exported into the statistical package JASP (Version 0.12.2) for presentation as descriptive statistics. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare differences between groups (faculty, study year, gender and religiosity), with a 5% level of significance used for all hypothesis tests. Cronbach's statistic, alpha, was used as a measure of the internal consistency of the items in the questionnaire. The overall alpha coefficient of the questionnaire was 0.836 (95% CI:0.812-0.858) and was found to be sufficient for the purposes of the study. From a total number of 741 PUMS students who engaged in volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic between 5 May and 30 June, 417 (56.3%) participated in the study. Students, who refused to complete the questionnaire did so because they lacked the time or the interest in the study, were unwilling to discuss their attitudes towards volunteering or quit due to personal reasons. Overall, 72.2% of the respondents were females and 27.8% were males, all of Polish origin ( Table 1 ). The overrepresentation of females can be explained by the fact that medical studies are strongly gendered in Poland, as females accounted for 77.2% of all students at PUMPS (4888 female vs 1442 male students) in 2019. Similarly, females accounted for 54% of all tertiary students, 57.7% of all graduates and 74% in the field of health and welfare in Europe in 2018 (Eurostat, 2020b) . Students who were in the last two of their three years of study volunteered more often than those in their first, second or third year (56.1% vs 43.9%, respectively). The vast majority were students of the medical faculty (61.4%) and lived in large agglomerations (52.3%). Although most respondents declared themselves as Christians (65.5%) and practising believers (33.8%), only 11.5% declared that religion played a significant role in their life. Based on the responses regarding students' attachment to religion and its role in their life, it seemed reasonable to divide the respondents into two groups: religious (students who declared that religion influences their life decisions and choices) versus ambivalent/non-religious (students who were not attached to religion or felt it was irrelevant to them). The comparison of these two groups showed that they did not differ in terms of gender, faculty and year of study. The only statistically significant difference was that more students who declared that religion played an important role in their life came from the smallest towns and villages (p = 0.021), while students who were ambivalent towards religion lived mainly in large cities (p = 0.03). After hearing the news about the COVID-19 outbreak, both students who were strongly attached to their religion and those who felt ambivalent about it felt the need to act and engage in the fight against the pandemic (64.4% vs 59.1%, respectively) (Table 2) . However, the former was statistically significantly more concerned that the pandemic might harm their loved ones (p = 0.015), while the latter felt anger more often (p = 0.036). When asked about their concerns related to their voluntary service during the COVID-19 outbreak, students who were ambivalent or irrelevant about religion felt more anxious about all the possible dangers related to volunteering and the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, they differed in a statistically significant way in their concerns regarding the possibility that the healthcare system might collapse (p = 0.002) and that the pandemic would affect their economic situation (p = 0.014). The analysis did not reveal any differences between both groups in their earlier involvement in volunteering, as more than two-thirds of the respondents in both groups had volunteered before. Moreover, neither the differences in the frequency of previous volunteering nor in volunteers' opinions about their expectations regarding the current voluntary service were found. Although religion was not a key predictor of the students' volunteering, it played a significant role in determining their motivations to join the fight against the pandemic. When asked about the reasons that influenced their decision about engaging in voluntary service after COVID-19 struck, the means calculated from the weights assigned differed significantly in the case of eight responses. As shown in Table 3 , students who felt strongly attached to their religion were statistically significantly driven by altruistic values more often than those for whom religion was irrelevant. While the former scored much higher when asked about such pro-social reasons as to help others (p ≤ 0.001), to give something back to the community (p = 0.003), to realise the duty of public service (p ≤ 0.001), to help succeed in the fight against the pandemic (p = 0.021) and to participate in something important (p = 0.006), non-religious students wanted to enhance their professional résumé more often (p = 0.041). The findings from this study are limited in several respects that may impact their generalisability and interpretation. First, although the response rate was reasonably high, students from only one Polish medical university were enrolled in the study. Second, as many students refused to complete the questionnaire, the results represent solely the opinions of those who agreed to participate in the study and cannot be generalised for the entire population of future health professionals either in Poznan or in Poland as a whole. Third, as we did not ask specific questions regarding students' religious attendance and beliefs, further in-depth studies would be required. However, we believe that as this is the first study examining the link between student's religiosity and motivations to volunteer during a COVID-19 pandemic in Poland it may stimulate further research on the topic.@story_separate@Compared to other European countries, Poland is still a conservative and religious nation, and religion in the country is still highly institutionalised, both at the public and private level. However, Poland is currently experiencing a changing relationship with the Church, as much of the population is moving towards a more secular view of life, one with a greater separation between the Church and the state, and a rejection of Church mandates on individual morality. Consequently, volunteering is also frequently perceived by many as a form of social activism rather than as a religious or moral duty. Thus, even though most Polish volunteers are still driven by altruistic motives, studies show that especially young people, including students, increasingly perceive volunteering as a possibility to gain new knowledge and skills that may benefit their future professional career (Centrum Badania Opinii Społecznej, 2011b; Sawicki, 2014; Olczyk, 2015; Jaronowska, 2017; Lubrańska & Zawira, 2017; Główny Urząd Statystyczny, 2017) . A similar observation has been made in other countries, where traditional volunteering is being replaced by its modern form (Brooks, 2002; Fényes & Pusztai, 2012; Handy et al., 2010; Holdsworth, 2010; Hustinx, 2001; Hustinx & Lammertyn, 2003; Rehberg, 2005; Voicu & Voicu, 2009 ). At the same time, this study shows that similar to other countries, future healthcare professionals in Poland expressed a strong interest in active participation during the current health care emergency (Chawłowska et al., 2021; Drexler et al., 2020; Gallagher & Schleyer, 2020; Gouda et al., 2020; Miller et al., 2020; Soled et al., 2020; Thomson & Lovegrove, 2020) . Furthermore, although students' religiosity was not a significant predictor of volunteering during the COVID-19 outbreak, it influenced their motivations to join the fight against the pandemic. Indeed, while the religious students were driven by altruistic motives (being useful for the society and doing something for others) at a higher rate, the non-religious students were focused more often on building their professional résumé and spending time in a useful way. Moreover, as the former stressed the desire to help others and to give something back to the community, they also more frequently emphasised that nurturance and care for others were deeply embedded in the role of health professionals. Consequently, they wanted to realise the duty of public service and help succeed in the fight against the pandemic. Thus, it seems that particularly during the current health crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, religion strengthened students' perception of the medical profession as a unique vocation and moral service, often stressing that as future health professionals they felt it was their duty to engage with and help those in need, disregarding the risk. Nevertheless, even in the case of students who defined themselves as deeply religious, pure altruism was not the only motivation, as most respondents volunteered to gain skills, connections or some kind of psychological satisfaction. Thus, it should be acknowledged that the motivations of many students were often a mixture of altruistic and egoistical drivers. It was also striking that although all the students were concerned about their health and the future of their education, non-religious students were more anxious about the risk associated with the voluntary service itself and possible consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on society, the country's economy, the healthcare system and their situation. Moreover, while religiously indifferent students felt anger more often, students who felt attached to their religion feared that the pandemic might harm their loved ones. Thus, again, students' religiosity was strongly correlated with altruistic values. However, for many volunteers religion served as a unique protective factor that helped with facing and coping with stress, making them feel more competent to volunteer. To conclude, while this study shows that students' religiosity was not a significant predictor of volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic, it did influence differences in students' motivation. Thus, it shows that all students committed to volunteering during the current health crisis constitute a good example of active citizenship and civic responsibility. At the same time, while both religious and non-religious students had altruistic and self-interested motivations for volunteering, several altruistic motivations were more common among religious students.","This study was designed to determine the relation between religion and the motivations of future healthcare professionals to volunteer during the COVID-19 outbreak in Poland. Data were collected from 417 healthcare students via an online questionnaire. The results indicated that although students’ religiosity was not a significant predictor of volunteering during the pandemic, it played a key role in determining their motivations to join the fight against COVID-19. There was a significant positive relationship between students’ religiosity and their eagerness to commit for the sake of the community rather than for personal or egoistic motives."
"In the late December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China [1] . The virus is highly pathogenic, and it is still spreading around the world, becoming a major public health concern. Specific and sensitive serological assays are urgently needed to understand the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, although a real-life laboratory validation is required [2] . As known, coronaviruses use the homotrimeric spike glycoprotein (comprising the S1 and S2 subunits in each spike monomer) present on the envelope, to bind to their cellular receptors; the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor is the critical step for SARS-CoV-2 to enter into target cells. In particular, the virus binds to ACE2 receptor with a high affinity, through a specific S protein region called the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) [3] . In this regard, human anti-S-RBD IgG are immunoglobulins directed against the RBD [4] ; as a consequence, being RBD within subunit S1 the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 IgGs, these immunoglobulins can disrupt the interaction between S-RBD and the ACE2 receptor. Therefore, S-RBD antibodies could prevent the virus from entering and infecting a cell by neutralizing or inhibiting its biological effect. However, it is not known if these responses are associated with protection against subsequent infections [5] . Besides, the elicitation kinetics, the identification of the most immunogenic epitopes and the neutralization power of neutralizing (NT) antibodies, evaluated by competitive assays exploiting S-RBD-ACE2 interaction, are still to be determined. Furthermore, several studies reported that NT antibodies bind with high affinity ACE2 receptor, completely preventing the virus-host cell interaction [6] . Other studies on the performance of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) describe the neutralization power of these antibodies, which could have therapeutic applications [7] [8] [9] . The aim of the present work was to longitudinally study the antibodies serum levels, in both not-hospitalized and hospitalized patients, detecting the presence of S-RBD antibodies and NT antibodies after six months from infection, using a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA). Improving the knowledge of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2, could play a role in therapy design and evaluation of vaccine efficacy.

Patients were classified in two categories, hospitalized and not hospitalized, as follows: 37 hospitalized (9 female and 28 male) of which 2 out of 37 hospitalized in ICU at the University Hospital Tor Vergata (Rome, Italy) because of fever and acute respiratory symptoms, collected at one week after hospital admission and after six months from SARS-CoV-2 infection; 35 not-hospitalized patients (16 female and 19 male), quarantined at home, paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic, to which blood was withdrawn by the Lifebrain laboratory (Guidonia Montecelio, Rome, Italy) personnel, collected after six months from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study was approved by Ethical Committee of Tor Vergata University Hospital of Rome, (protocol no. R.S.44.20). Informed consent was obtained from all the subject enrolled in the study. The study was in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, as revised in 2013. The Maglumi SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD is an indirect Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA) for the in vitro semi-quantitative determination of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD protein, performed by fully automated Maglumi 800 analytical system (Snibe Diagnostic, Shenzhen, China). Sample, buffer solution and magnetic beads coated with S-RBD recombinant antigen are mixed thoroughly. After settling in a magnetic field, the supernatant is decanted, and a wash cycle is performed. Then, anti-human IgG antibodies labelled with amino-butyl-ethyl-isoluminol (ABEI) are added and incubated to form immune-complexes. After a second precipitation in a magnetic field, the supernatant is decanted, and another wash cycle is performed. A starter reagent is added to initiate a chemiluminescent reaction, producing a light signal measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLUs), which is proportional to the concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG present in the sample. Cut-off value is 1.00 AU/mL and the conversion factors to transform AU/mL in BAU/mL is 4.33 as declared by manufacturer. Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA/IgM Neutralizing Antibodies (NT) was performed by a competitive Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA), on the fully automated Maglumi analytical system (SNIBE Diagnostics, Shenzhen, China). The assay is designed by mimicking the virus-host interaction using the highly specific ACE2 protein-RBD protein interaction. The neutralizing antibodies will compete with the S-RBD antigens for the binding to ACE2 so that when neutralizing antibodies are present in the serum sample, they can prevent RBD-ACE2 bond. Sample, buffer solution, magnetic beads coated with specific ACE2 antigens and anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD recombinant antigens labelled with amino-butyl-ethyl-isoluminol (ABEI) are mixed thoroughly and incubated. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NT antibodies present in the sample compete with ACE2 antigen immobilized on magnetic microbeads for the binding to recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD specific antigen labeled with ABEI. After precipitation in a magnetic field, the supernatant is removed, and a wash cycle is performed. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added to initiate a chemiluminescent reaction. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLUs), which are inversely proportional to the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies present in the sample. Cut-off value is 0.05 µg/mL and the conversion factor to transform µg/mL in IU/mL are 405, as declared by manufacturer. We analyzed the data of gender and age (range: 22 to 81 years old) of all patients and divided by not hospitalized and hospitalized patients. The rate differences in age groups and gender were estimated by chisquare (χ2) test. Descriptive analyses were performed, with measures of central tendency and dispersion for continuous variables and frequency distribution for qualitative ones. In the case of normally distributed data, they were represented by the mean ± standard deviation and Anova with Bonferroni post hoc test to determine the differences between groups. In the case of not normally distributed data, they were represented by the median and the percentiles; the variables were compared through the Kruskal-Wallis test. Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to determine the distribution with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%. Finally, to determine the S-RBD IgG levels related to the beginning of NT antibodies production, the results of S-RBD antibodies levels with NT antibodies positivity were compared to the results of S-RBD antibodies levels with NT antibodies negativity and analyzed by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. All data were examined using Med Calc Ver.18.2.18 (MedCalc Software Ltd, Ostend, Belgium). The statistical significance level established for all tests performed was p < 0.05. The aim of this work was to determine if there was a significant difference in S-RBD and NT antibodies concentration between the hospitalized and not-hospitalized group, after six months from SARS-CoV-2 symptoms onset. The patients analyzed were mostly in an age range of 50-55 years old (age mean 53.61, SD 14.26) in both groups. There is an irrelevant difference (p greater than 0.05) in age group in hospitalized and not-hospitalized patients: the age mean of first ones was 53.36 (SD: 10.92), while the age mean of the other group was 53.88 (SD: 17.26). Conversely, a significant prevalence of morbidity was noted in both groups among male 66.67% (48 out of 72) despite of female rate 33.33% (34 out of 72), with p < 0.01. The data were not normally distributed (verified by applying Sha-piroWilk test) and were characterized by median and percentiles values for both S-RBD and NT antibodies (Table 1 ). In Fig. 1 the data has been represented by a scatter-plot indicating on the vertical axis the observed antibody values and on the horizontal axis the study group. Fig. 1 A shows that the not-hospitalized patients' median value of S-RBD antibody levels (67.25 BAU/mL) is significantly lower than median value of hospitalized patients (224.16 BAU/mL), with a p < 0.001. It can be also noticed that several hospitalized patients (7 out of 37: 18.92%) developed S-RBD antibodies levels greater than 400 BAU/mL, compared to not-hospitalized patients (3 out of 35: 8.57%). Fig. 1B shows data for NT antibody levels and even in this case the hospitalized patients show a median higher value (958.23 IU/mL) than not-hospitalized patients (223.15 IU/mL), with a p < 0.001. Likewise, S-RBD IgGs levels, NT antibodies values were higher than 2000 IU/ mL in more hospitalized patients (9 out of 37: 24.32%) than in nothospitalized patients (4 out of 35: 11.43%). Overall, the data after six months from symptoms onset highlighted that in not-hospitalized group, S-RBD IgGs median serum levels were positive in 23 out of 35 patients (65.71%) and NT antibodies in only 13 out of 35 patients (37.14%). Conversely, the results in hospitalized group were considerably different; the S-RBD and NT antibodies were detected in 36 out of 37 patients (97.29%) and in 28 out of 37 patients (75.67%), respectively. Moreover, an absolute S-RBD and NT antibodies absence in 8 out of 35 not-hospitalized patients (22.85%), compared to only 1 out of 37 hospitalized patients (2.70%), was found. Furthermore, 2 nothospitalized patients were re-infected during the six months period; despite the double infection, the patients remained antibody negatives and they are still not-immune to SARS-CoV-2. It was also observed that in hospitalized patients the results at one week after hospital admission showed high levels of S-RBD (25 out of 37: 67.56%) and NT antibodies (15 out of 37: 40.54%). In Fig. 2 are reported the linear correlations between S-RBD and NT antibodies in both groups. Not-hospitalized ( Fig. 2A) and hospitalized (Fig. 2B ) patients data have a linear relationship, indicating a directly proportional increase of S-RBD vs NT antibodies. To note, the Pearson coefficient R was higher in not-hospitalized patients vs hospitalized patients (R = 0.95; p < 0.0001 vs R = 0.76; p < 0.0001). However, this trend could be explained by the higher number of patients in the second group with antibodies concentration values greater than 400 BAU/mL and 2000 IU/mL. Indeed, those samples have been diluted and the discrepancies are probably due to the exceeding of the detection linearity limits of the assays. Finally, the cut-off value of S-RBD IgG levels corresponding to the beginning of NT antibodies production has been calculated by a ROC curve, as illustrated in Fig. 3 . By comparing results from samples with detectable S-RBD and NT antibodies levels, to samples with detectable S-RBD and no NT  Currently, our understanding of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still to be determined. It is certain that the infection spread mainly in pre-elderly men (50-65 years), as emerged, at the beginning of the pandemic [1] . Although, it is barely known the immunity after infection, and which is the protective role of S-RBD and NT antibodies. Moreover, as the administration of vaccines is proceeding, serological tests and a comprehensive antibodies characterization would be necessary to determine its effectiveness. The persistence of antibodies in current analysis suggests that anti-S-RBD IgGs remain at high levels for at least 6 months after the onset of symptoms in both male and female. The results are in line with the emerging evidence on the seroprevalence, persistence and decay of antibody responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection [8, 10, 11] . Differently, antibodies absence after six months from SARS-CoV-2 infection, was observed in a small percentage (2.70%) of hospitalized individuals, compared to 22.85% of not-hospitalized patients. It was also noticed a wide distribution of antibodies serum levels, which were proportionally related to disease severity in the groups analyzed: hospitalized patients had higher S-RBD IgGs levels than not hospitalized, as also shown in Roltgen's study [11] . Moreover, in addition to anti-S-RBD IgGs, it was also found that NT antibodies levels, after 6 months period, were extremely higher in hospitalized patients, than in not-hospitalized ones. Reasonably, these discrepancies could be due to various factors, such as immune status, age, co-morbidities, or antigenic load. Furthermore, the NT antibodies levels in not-hospitalized and hospitalized patients correlate proportionally to the S-RBD IgG levels. In addition, since some of not-hospitalized patients were S-RBD and NT antibodies negative after the six months period and they have experienced re-infection during these months, it would be suggested that the antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD could have inactivating power on the virus, confirming previous studies [8, 10] . Unfortunately, it is not currently known the concentration threshold for immunization. In contrast, the hospitalized patients showed increased concentration of S-RBD and NT antibodies respect to not hospitalized, corroborating the relationship with symptoms severity, as reported in literature [11, 12] . Moreover, in some of these patients, NT antibodies are produced since the first week from symptoms onset. Overall, the observation that positive S-RBD IgGs and NT antibodies responses persist over time is encouraging and it suggests the development of a robust immune memory system in severe infections. The availability of NT antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will offer advantages for the control of the current pandemic and the possible protection towards a re-appearance of the virus in the future. Anyhow, the results denote that although most SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals may produce S-RBD IgGs, they may not be sufficient to effectively prevent the binding of RBD to ACE2 receptor to neutralize the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells and, therefore, to make the virus harmless. Finally, this study shows that the increase of S-RBD IgG levels correlates with increasing NT antibody levels. Further studies looking at the functionality of these antibodies could improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 acquired immunity. The current study is unfortunately limited to a small number of samples; it will be interesting to verify these data in a larger cohort of individuals and perform more accurate in vitro studies will be necessary to confirm the effective role of these antibodies. Furthermore, in vitro cross-neutralization studies could provide clues about their protective activity and could suggest a cut-off value from which immune memory is built. Likewise, by monitoring antibody levels, it will be possible to assess the immune response after vaccination and S-RBD and NT antibodies could lead a potential preventive approach to counter the current pandemic. Lastly, more than 600 immunoassays are available for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection and most anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD tests are not yet standardized either with the NIBSC (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, UK), or the World Health Organization (WHO) [13] International Standard (IS) [14] . At this purpose, the data of this work was evaluated directly the binding antibody units (BAU) for S-RBD antibodies and the international units (IU) for NT antibodies using the WHO IS, as declared by the company. Once all tests will be standardized it will be easier to assess the serum protection and the validity of the vaccine, as well as compare the different serological specific-antibodies tests results.

By comparing results from samples with detectable S-RBD and NT antibodies levels, to samples with detectable S-RBD and no NT antibodies levels, a cut-off > 130.38 BAU/mL has been assessed with an AUC (area under curve) value of 0.944 and a sensitivity and specificity of 90.24% and 93.33%, respectively. Currently, our understanding of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still to be determined. It is certain that the infection spread mainly in pre-elderly men (50-65 years), as emerged, at the beginning of the pandemic [1] . Although, it is barely known the immunity after infection, and which is the protective role of S-RBD and NT antibodies. Moreover, as the administration of vaccines is proceeding, serological tests and a comprehensive antibodies characterization would be necessary to determine its effectiveness. The persistence of antibodies in current analysis suggests that anti-S-RBD IgGs remain at high levels for at least 6 months after the onset of symptoms in both male and female. The results are in line with the emerging evidence on the seroprevalence, persistence and decay of antibody responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection [8, 10, 11] . Differently, antibodies absence after six months from SARS-CoV-2 infection, was observed in a small percentage (2.70%) of hospitalized individuals, compared to 22.85% of not-hospitalized patients. It was also noticed a wide distribution of antibodies serum levels, which were proportionally related to disease severity in the groups analyzed: hospitalized patients had higher S-RBD IgGs levels than not hospitalized, as also shown in Roltgen's study [11] . Moreover, in addition to anti-S-RBD IgGs, it was also found that NT antibodies levels, after 6 months period, were extremely higher in hospitalized patients, than in not-hospitalized ones. Reasonably, these discrepancies could be due to various factors, such as immune status, age, co-morbidities, or antigenic load. Furthermore, the NT antibodies levels in not-hospitalized and hospitalized patients correlate proportionally to the S-RBD IgG levels. In addition, since some of not-hospitalized patients were S-RBD and NT antibodies negative after the six months period and they have experienced re-infection during these months, it would be suggested that the antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD could have inactivating power on the virus, confirming previous studies [8, 10] . Unfortunately, it is not currently known the concentration threshold for immunization. In contrast, the hospitalized patients showed increased concentration of S-RBD and NT antibodies respect to not hospitalized, corroborating the relationship with symptoms severity, as reported in literature [11, 12] . Moreover, in some of these patients, NT antibodies are produced since the first week from symptoms onset. Overall, the observation that positive S-RBD IgGs and NT antibodies responses persist over time is encouraging and it suggests the development of a robust immune memory system in severe infections. The availability of NT antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will offer advantages for the control of the current pandemic and the possible protection towards a re-appearance of the virus in the future. Anyhow, the results denote that although most SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals may produce S-RBD IgGs, they may not be sufficient to effectively prevent the binding of RBD to ACE2 receptor to neutralize the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells and, therefore, to make the virus harmless. Finally, this study shows that the increase of S-RBD IgG levels correlates with increasing NT antibody levels. Further studies looking at the functionality of these antibodies could improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 acquired immunity. The current study is unfortunately limited to a small number of samples; it will be interesting to verify these data in a larger cohort of individuals and perform more accurate in vitro studies will be necessary to confirm the effective role of these antibodies. Furthermore, in vitro cross-neutralization studies could provide clues about their protective activity and could suggest a cut-off value from which immune memory is built. Likewise, by monitoring antibody levels, it will be possible to assess the immune response after vaccination and S-RBD and NT antibodies could lead a potential preventive approach to counter the current pandemic. Lastly, more than 600 immunoassays are available for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection and most anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD tests are not yet standardized either with the NIBSC (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, UK), or the World Health Organization (WHO) [13] International Standard (IS) [14] . At this purpose, the data of this work was evaluated directly the binding antibody units (BAU) for S-RBD antibodies and the international units (IU) for NT antibodies using the WHO IS, as declared by the company. Once all tests will be standardized it will be easier to assess the serum protection and the validity of the vaccine, as well as compare the different serological specific-antibodies tests results.

Understanding the mechanisms of action of antibodies can provide valuable implications for the rapid development of antibody therapy and the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In fact, most of the vaccines produced so far are based on the viral protein S, which domain is detected by serological analysis. These tests will help in a close future to evaluate immune response and antibody levels in all individuals adhering to the vaccination campaign.

These tests will help in a close future to evaluate immune response and antibody levels in all individuals adhering to the vaccination campaign.","The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet fully defined, but the availability of sensitive and specific serological assays is crucial to observe the presence of specific antibodies against the human receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and high specificity ACE-2-binding antibodies or neutralizing antibodies (NT) in response to vaccines. Indeed, these peculiar antibodies should prevent viral interaction between RBD and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, located on surface of host cells. In this study, 72 samples from 37 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 35 not-hospitalized patients were analyzed longitudinally. The detection of S-RBD and NT antibodies was carried out using CLIA tests. Hospitalized patients showed elevated serum levels of S-RBD (97.22%) and NT (77.78%) antibodies, differently, not-hospitalized, who were paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic patients, showed lower serum levels of S-RBD (65.71%) and NT (38.14%) antibodies. The results suggest that the NT serum level is strongly related to disease severity (p < 0.001) and to the serum level of S-RBD antibodies (p < 0.0001)."
"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the USA and globally [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Furthermore, maternal mortality is rising in the USA, with 41% of deaths retrospectively evaluated deemed to have been preventable [8] . While pregnancy is recognized as a time of hemodynamic stress for women with underlying cardiovascular disease, it is now also recognized that a substantial portion of pregnancyassociated cardiovascular complications are due to acquired disease, for which obesity, pre-existing diabetes, and pre-existing hypertension are significant risk factors. Beyond pregnancy, the postpartum period is one of elevated risk as far out as a year postpartum, with approximately one-third of maternal deaths occurring during this period [9] . Normal pregnancy is marked by several hemodynamic changes which occur over a compressed period of time (Fig. 1) . Maternal cardiac output rises early in pregnancy and increases in sum approximately 30-50% for singleton pregnancies [11] [12] [13] 14 ••, [15] [16] [17] . Estrogen contributes to plasma volume expansion, which increases approximately 40% throughout pregnancy. There is a concomitant increase in red cell mass-though to a lesser extent than plasma volume expansion-which contributes to the physiologic anemia of pregnancy. An increase in heart rate (which increases 10-20 beats per minute above pre-pregnancy values) contributes to the increase in cardiac output. Finally, systemic venous resistance (SVR) decreases due to maturation of the low resistance placental, which can result in a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in early pregnancy; the SVR nadirs at approximately 24 weeks of gestation and then gradually increases thereafter. SVR rapidly increases after delivery of the placental. Thereafter, hemodynamic shifts occur rapidly in the first 2 postpartum weeks, though full return to pre-pregnancy hemodynamics occur over the first 6 postpartum months. Substantial overlap exists between symptoms that commonly accompany normal pregnancy and those that signal early manifestations of cardiovascular disease including hyperventilation (and associated dyspnea), anemia, weight gain, and edema [11] . As such, echocardiography is a clinically invaluable tool for the evaluation of pregnant women both in the context of underlying cardiovascular disease and those without known pre-existing disease presenting with symptoms that are challenging to distinguish from uncomplicated pregnancy. Furthermore, it is widely available and does not require the use of radiation or intravenous contrast.@story_separate@General approaches to image acquisition for pregnant women are similar to imaging protocols utilized for non-pregnant patients. A key advantage to echocardiography in the context of pregnancy is its excellent safety profile. Investigations to date have not reported any adverse effects from the utilization of diagnostic ultrasound, which is therefore utilized frequently in clinical practice [18] . An important distinction is that supine positioning can be challenging due to compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and pelvic veins by the gravid uterus, particularly after 20 weeks of gestation. Left lateral decubitus positioning is therefore preferred. In late pregnancy, cardiac output is estimated to be approximately 14% lower in the supine position as compared to the left lateral decubitus position, and approximately 8% of women will experience frank symptomatic hypotension while supine [11] . When required, agitated saline contrast is generally felt to be safe during pregnancy (FDA Category B), though rigorous studies have not been performed for investigation of its use [18] . Intravenous echocardiographic contrast agents utilizing perflutren lipid microspheres or perflutren protein type A have similarly not been studied during pregnancy; as such, potential risks vs benefits must be considered with avoidance if other imaging strategies are available [19] . Where necessary, transesophageal echocardiography can be safely performed in pregnant women, with the majority of risk related to required sedation, which carries the potential for increased risk of aspiration in the context of pregnancy [14••] . When required, exercise stress testing can be safely performed [14••] . Pharmacology stress is rarely indicated during pregnancy and use of pharmacologic stress agents should be avoided if possible [14••] . The hemodynamic changes of pregnancy are often accompanied by normative structural adaptations. Echocardiographic findings of normal pregnancy are summarized in Table 1 . Increases in blood volume can result in atrial and ventricular chamber dilation, though parameters remain within the upper limits of normal for non-pregnant controls [21] [22] [23] [24] . Upper limits of normal have not been specifically defined for the pregnant woman. Reversible eccentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle is accompanied by an increase in left ventricular mass of approximately 5-10% [25] . All chamber changes typically return to baseline levels within weeks postpartum. The effect of pregnancy on myocardial contractility is controversial. Based on conventional echocardiographic estimates, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is generally unchanged or can be slightly increased, though data to date is conflicting [13, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Using load-independent measures-particularly tissue Doppler imaging-diastolic function similarly does not change significantly with normal pregnancy [22, 25, 26] . E/e' remains unchanged. Due to a normative decrease in pulmonary vascular capacitance, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) also does not change despite substantial increases in plasma volume [25] . Pseudodyskinesis can be appreciated due to external compression from the gravid uterus. Increase in chamber sizes and blood volumes in pregnancy can result in annular dilation, which in turn results in increased valvular regurgitation as well as increased transvalvular velocities. These effects are greatest in early third trimester and at labor and resolve early postpartum [13, 25, 27, 28] . Valvular regurgitation in pregnancy is most commonly observed in the tricuspid and pulmonic valves. Despite an increase in size of the aortic annular dimension, aortic regurgitation is not normative even in the context of pregnancy [13] . Asymptomatic pericardial effusions (often trace or mild) are common in pregnancy occurring in approximately 40% of women, in the third trimester. They are thought to be related to hormonally mediated volume retention and are most often clinically silent, resolving within 6 weeks postpartum [29] . Because of its availability, cost-effectiveness, and versatility, echocardiography is central to the assessment of women at the pre-conception stage. [31] risk stratification scores commonly utilized in clinical practice (Table 2 ) all incorporate severity of underlying cardiac lesion, which can and should be assessed by echocardiography prior to conception. As such, any woman with known pre-existing cardiovascular disease should undergo pre-conception echocardiography. Notably, however, the available risk scores are only applicable to women with known pre-existing cardiovascular disease and do not aid in  Obtaining preconception imaging requires that all cardiologists proactively ask women about their intentions surrounding pregnancy during all routine cardiovascular visits and ensuring that they have a plan for reliable contraception should pregnancy not be intended. Tools such as the One Key Question® of ""Would you like to become pregnant in the next year"" [32] can easily be incorporated into all cardiovascular visits among women of reproductive potential. Women with high-risk cardiovascular lesions should be referred to a center with cardio-obstetric expertise and undergo more extensive evaluation and counseling by a multidisciplinary team [33••] . However, limited data to date suggest that the prevalence of preconception counseling is suboptimal even among women with mWHO 3 and 4 disease, highlighting the need for more routine counseling of women of reproductive age at all cardiovascular encounters [34] . Echocardiography is central to preconception counseling of women with known pre-existing valvular heart disease and any woman with a history of valvular prosthesis or native valve disease should ideally undergo echocardiographic imaging prior to conception. Lesion severity is incorporated into the major risk stratification tools (CARPREG II [30] , mWHO [14] , and ZAHARA [31] ), with left-sided stenotic lesions and mechanical prostheses posing the highest risk to pregnant women. Women with high-risk lesions (particularly mitral stenosis) should be counseled that even if well compensated outside of pregnancy, given significant increases in heart rate, circulating volume, and cardiac output during pregnancy, left-sided stenotic lesions are high risk in the context of pregnancy and therefore merit intervention when possible prior to conception [33••] . Valve characteristics should be carefully imaged in the preconception setting in order to optimally guide interventional strategies when necessary. If possible, valve repair is preferable to bioprosthetic replacement, as the presence of a bioprosthesis still increases a woman's cardiovascular risk during pregnancy above women without structural heart disease, though is far preferable to untreated significant native valve disease [35] and can be subject to deterioration during pregnancy [36, 37] . Mechanical prostheses should be •Bicuspid with 950 mm aortic dilation avoided whenever possible in women who may desire future pregnancy due to their high-risk profile to both mother and fetus during pregnancy [30••, 36] , in large part mediated by the multitude of complicating factors surrounding anticoagulation during pregnancy. Women with pre-existing congenital heart disease should be followed at centers with expertise in adult congenital disease. Given the unique risk profile-especially of women with complex congenital disease-preconception echocardiograms are critical and should be obtained when counseling women regarding their risk during pregnancy. During pregnancy, these women should be followed by a multidisciplinary cardio-obstetric team inclusive of an adult congenital cardiologist and monitoring should include frequent echocardiography. Women with severe systolic impairment prior to pregnancy (LVEF G30%) should be counseled regarding their very high risk and discouraged from pregnancy [  Echocardiography is central to the cardiovascular monitoring of patients receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy. In particular, global longitudinal strain (GLS) is key in the monitoring of patients as a more sensitive means of detecting early systolic dysfunction as compared with LVEF alone. With advances in oncologic treatment and increasing maternal age, more female survivors of cancer are entering pregnancy and should undergo preconception evaluation. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) recommends preconception cardiovascular evaluation for women who have received ≥300 mg/m 2 of cumulative anthracycline, ≥30 Gy of chest radiation, combination chemotherapy and radiation, and who have already manifested arrhythmias or structural disease [38] . Women who have received cardiotoxic treatment (particularly anthracycline therapy) should undergo echocardiography preconception in order to assess for pre-existing systolic dysfunction [39] , inclusive of strain imaging when possible. Those who have received chest radiation should also undergo preconception screening for valvular heart disease [14••] . Echocardiography in pregnant women with pre-existing cardiovascular disease During pregnancy, overall guidelines are lacking with respect to standard intervals for routine re-imaging of women with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Present available recommendations suggest imaging each trimester, though clinical changes should prompt greater frequency [14••, 21] . However, further research is required to understand better how best to monitor women with cardiovascular disease during their pregnancies in the absence of clinical changes. For example, in the Standardized Outcomes in Reproductive Cardiovascular Care (STORCC) initiative in which women with pre-existing cardiovascular disease received echocardiograms preconception, second trimester, third trimester, and postpartum, only 12% of women were found to have significant echocardiographic changes during their pregnancy on routine monitoring [40] . Of the additional studies performed for clinical indications, 24% resulted in a change in management decisions. Thus, further investigations are required to optimize routine monitoring strategies for women with pre-existing disease, including how best to incorporate echocardiography into routine monitoring. All women with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (and all fetuses with a firstdegree relative with structural heart disease or relevant disorder of Mendelian inheritance within their family) should be offered screening fetal echocardiography [41] . A large proportion of cardiovascular events occur de novo during pregnancy in women without known pre-existing CVD and echocardiography should therefore also be utilized as the first-line imaging modality of choice should a woman experience any concerning signs or symptoms of cardiovascular disease. While there is substantial overlap in the signs and symptoms of normal pregnancy and early cardiovascular disease, any woman presenting with chest pain, dyspnea at rest or with minimal exertion (especially when sudden in onset), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope, sustained palpitations, new systolic murmur (excluding flow murmurs), diastolic murmurs, persistent tachycardia 9100 beats per minute, cyanosis or clubbing, an S4, pulmonary rales, elevated jugular venous pressure, or cyanosis/clubbing should be evaluated by a cardiologist and often imaged with echocardiography (Fig. 2 ). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are affecting an increasing number of women and are a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide after cardiovascular disease. As assessed on a per-woman basis, HDP affect 15.3% of women, and preeclampsia occurs in 7.5% [43] . In contrast to chronic hypertension, HDP develops after 20 weeks of gestation with hypertension ≥140/90 mmHg. Gestational hypertension is defined as new onset hypertension alone while pre-eclampsia occurs when hypertension is associated with significant proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction. Women with chronic hypertension are at elevated risk for developing superimposed pre-eclampsia, which is detected with new-onset proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction [33••] . While the manifestations of HDP occur in late pregnancy or postpartum, the clinical syndrome begins with abnormal placentation and failure of normal trophoblast invasion and incomplete spiral artery remodeling [44] . Resulting placental hypoxia results in an increase in angiogenic markers, which result in endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction, and oxidative stress. Thus, in contrast to normal pregnancy, women with HDP experience an increase in vascular resistance, which results in adverse left ventricular remodeling with concentric-rather than normative eccentric-remodeling [44, 45] . In one study examining echocardiographic findings in the context of acute preeclampsia, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), left atrial area, left ventricular wall thickness, and the mitral E/e' ratio were all significantly higher among women with preeclampsia (N = 63 cases) as compared to normotensive pregnant women (N = 36 controls) [46] . However, when the absolute values are examined, they were not significantly elevated from a clinical perspective among women with acute preeclampsia (e.g., RVSP 31 mmHg ± 7.9 vs 22.5 mmHg ± 6.1) [47] , and thus, further investigation is warranted into the acute cardiovascular effects of the disease process. Development of pulmonary edema among women with preeclampsia is often multifactorial with contributions from diastolic dysfunction, increased vascular permeability, volume retention from corticosteroid administration (in the context of fetal prematurity), and volume administration in the context of labor and delivery, which remains the mainstay of treatment. Signs and symptoms that warrant further cardiovascular investigation in pregnancy. Image reproduced with permission from [42] . Furthermore, there is significant overlap between preeclampsia and peripartum cardiomyopathy [47] [48] [49] [50] , and thus, women with preeclampsia-especially those with dyspnea, volume overload, and evidence of pulmonary edema-may warrant investigation with echocardiography to assess for left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. Beyond pregnancy, HDP are robustly associated with increased later-life risk of cardiovascular disease and are included in the most recent American Heart Association (AHA) lipid guidelines as a risk enhancing factor [51] . In addition to increasing a woman's risk of future coronary disease, however, they are further recognized to increase risk of heart failure, as well as valvular disease including aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation [52] . While HDP are overall felt to increase risk through accelerated vascular aging, the specific mechanism of later-life valvular dysfunction is currently unknown and warrants further investigation. In addition, echocardiographic analyses of women performed a decade after HDP demonstrate evidence of adverse LV remodeling with increased left ventricular wall thickness and relative wall thickness as compared with women who experienced normotensive pregnancies [53] . Women who developed chronic hypertension following HDP represented the highest risk group, though women with HDP alone in the absence of chronic hypertension still demonstrated high risk of adverse remodeling. Given the recent emergence of these data, the manner in which women demonstrating evidence of adverse LV remodeling following HDP should be surveyed long term is a question that requires further investigation. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare but serious cardiac complication of pregnancy. The diagnosis is made when new onset cardiomyopathy (defined as an LVEF G45%) develops in late pregnancy or early postpartum [54] . It is often accompanied by left ventricular dilation, right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, biatrial enlargement, intracardiac thrombus, and functional valvular regurgitation. In addition to being central to the diagnosis, echocardiography provides prognostic information for patients with PPCM. The IPAC (Investigations of Pregnancy Associated Cardiomyopathy) study followed 100 women in North America with peripartum cardiomyopathy for 1 year after delivery [55] . In this group, severe impairment of left ventricular systolic function at baseline (LVEFG0.30) and left ventricular dilation (LVEDD 96.0 cm) were both associated with lower LVEF at 12 months. The majority of women in this study experienced left ventricular recovery at 12 months. However, none of the women with both a baseline LVEF G0.30 and an LVEDD ≥6.0 cm experienced recovery of systolic function. In contrast, 91% of women with an initial LVEF ≥0.30 and LVEDD G6.0 cm recovered. After multivariable adjustment, race and LVEDD remained significant predictors of systolic recovery. Subgroup analyses further demonstrated significant association between baseline LVEF and LVEF at 1 year only in Black women (p = 0.005) and that Black race was independently associated with lower LVEF at 1 year. Thus, in essence, Black women were less likely to experience improvement of LVEF at 1 year as compared with non-Black women. In another cohort, African American women were nearly twice as likely to demonstrate persistent LV dysfunction as compared with non-African American women (52 [43. 0%] vs 24 [24.2%], P = .004), and, when they did recover, recovery took at twice as long (median, 265 vs 125.5 days; P = .02) [56] . Right ventricular function at diagnosis has also been shown to be predictive of prognosis with impaired right ventricular function (RV fractional area change G36%) associating with higher rates of persistent LV dysfunction or adverse clinical events (7.2 (95% CI, 5.1-58.6; P G 0.001)) [57] . Analysis of strain patterns also shows a decrease in GLS in PPCM patients [58, 59] , and the presence of these strain changes appear to be associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes, which include higher rates of LV assist device implantation, persistent LV dysfunction, and death. In analysis of patients within IPAC, GLS at presentation at a cutoff of 10.6% (absolute value) and global circumferential strain (GCS) at a cutoff of 10.1% were both associated with adverse clinical outcomes with a high sensitivity and specificity and were found to be additive to LVEF assessment alone [59] . At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, global longitudinal strain values were significantly lower for Black women as compared with non-Black women. Echocardiography is also central to counseling women with a history of PPCM with respect to risk with subsequent pregnancy. Multiple studies demonstrate that women with persistent left ventricular dysfunction are at highest risk and mortality can be as high as 50% in some series [60] . While in a single study, normalization of systolic function was found to be associated with a low risk of mortality in subsequent pregnancy (as compared with a reported 19% among women with persistent LV dysfunction), but the risk of clinical heart failure (21%), decrement in LVEF (21%), and durable LV dysfunction (14%) remained significant [61] . Women with persistent LV dysfunction who enter a subsequent pregnancy experience heart failure (44%), decrement in LVEF (25%), and persistent LV function (31%) at substantial rates. Beyond LVEF, there is significant interest in how best to risk stratify patients desiring a future pregnancy, with some evidence supporting the utilization of stress echocardiography to evaluate contractile reserve [62] . In a small case series of pregnant women post-PPCM, none of the 9 women with adequate contractile reserve on exercise stress echo experienced PPCM recurrence [63] . More recently, there have been reports of uncomplicated pregnancies in women with contractile reserve using dobutamine stress echocardiography [20] . Whether strain imaging may provide additive prognostic value is of interest and merits further investigation. Aortic dissection occurs uncommonly during pregnancy and the postpartum period (5.5 cases per million pregnant women) but carries a high risk of mortality and occurs more commonly during pregnancy than in a comparable non-pregnant population (1.4 cases per million women) [64] . Among women younger than age 35 enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) registry, 19% experienced dissections in the context of pregnancy [64] demonstrating the elevation in risk that pregnancy poses with respect to this cardiovascular complication [65] . Risk of dissection is greatest between 3 months of gestation and 3 months postpartum [64] , with most postpartum dissections occurring in the first 2 weeks postpartum [65] . Women with Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz, type 4 Ehlers-Danlos, Turner's syndrome, bicuspid aortopathies, and familial aortopathies represent the highest risk groups, though 47% of dissections occur in pregnant women who were not previously aware of an aortopathy until after their dissection [64, 66] . Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is the preferred initial study for diagnosing and monitoring thoracic aortopathies in pregnancy. The frequency with which monitoring is recommended depends on underlying pathology but is generally monthly or bimonthly, with TTE serving as a powerful tool for surveillance when dilation is localized to the ascending aorta [67] . Surveillance should continue to at least 6 months postpartum [14••] . Ischemic heart disease is a relatively rare complication of pregnancy (occurring in between 2.8 and 8.1 per 100,000 deliveries) although the prevalence is expected to rise with advancing maternal age and increasing prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes [68, 69] . When it does occur, myocardial infarction during pregnancy is associated with an excess of both maternal and fetal mortality [70, 71] . In addition to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease which is believed to be responsible for approximately one-third of cases, pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction may occur due to spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), coronary embolus or in situ thrombus, and coronary vasospasm [69] . Women with a history of ischemic heart disease who desire pregnancy should undergo echocardiography to determine pre-pregnancy LVEF and assess for baseline wall motion abnormalities [14••] . Cardiac stress testing is often utilized to assess for burden of residual ischemia pre-pregnancy, and as such, stress echocardiography is a useful tool for assessment of LV function with stress [14••, 72] . During pregnancy, any woman presenting with an acute myocardial infarction should be treated with guideline directed therapy as in the non-pregnant population-including coronary angiography when indicated. However, in women presenting with chest pain in the absence of a clear acute coronary syndrome, TTE remains a readily accessible and safe additional diagnostic test to assess LV function, regional wall motion abnormalities, and non-ischemic findings which may be contributing to symptoms. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the USA examining 8207 pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 found that after adjusting for age, medical comorbidities, race and ethnicity, pregnant women were significantly more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (with an adjusted risk ratio of 1.5; 95% CI 1.2-1.8) and require mechanical ventilation (with an adjusted risk ratio of 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4) as compared to non-pregnant women. The risk of death however did not differ by pregnancy status (with an adjusted risk ratio of 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5-1.5) [73•]. As such, pregnant women appear to be at elevated risk for adverse outcomes in the context of COVID-19 infections. Cardiomyopathy has been reported in case series of pregnant patients with severe COVID-19 [74, 75] , and many experts have called for a lower threshold for use of echocardiography in clinically appropriate patients to allow for early detection of cardiac dysfunction in the context of COVID 19 [76] . The American College of Cardiology (ACC) Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 suggests that patients demonstrating heart failure signs/symptoms, arrhythmia, or have electrocardiographic changes should undergo echocardiography [77] . The evaluation of the right ventricle (RV) is of particular importance especially for acutely ill COVID-19 patients with suspected acute cor pulmonale. The use of echocardiography per local safety protocols, and with appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), is especially highlighted by the ACC and supported by the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) [78] . Because of its portability, echocardiography affords a clear advantage in imaging patients as it minimizes risk of virus transmission involved in having to move the patient. Hand-held point-of-care devices are increasingly favored given reduced risk of contamination of devices as compared to traditional machines. In contrast to a global reduction in maternal mortality, the maternal mortality rate in the USA continues to increase, with a 150% increase from 1987 to 2016 (7.2 to 17.4 per 100,000 live births) [79] . Significant disparities exist within maternal outcomes in the USA, with Black women facing a 3-4× higher risk of pregnancy-related mortality as compared with White women [80] . While differences in social determinants of health contribute to these disparities, they do not entirely account for the differences in US maternal health between Black and non-Black women [81] . Beyond maternal mortality itself, HDP and PPCM are known to disproportionately affect Black women. [56, 82, 83] Access to care during pregnancy and the postpartum period is often highlighted as a significant determinant of maternal health and most pregnancy-associated deaths are felt to be preventable [81] . This is critical to understand, especially in the context of research among non-pregnant populations, which have demonstrated that women, Black patients, Medicaid patients, and those of increasing age (by decade after age 60) are less likely to receive appropriate TTE surveillance for valvular disease [84] . A broader critique of echocardiographic use is that current studies used to define normative values do not to reflect the diversity of populations in the USA [85] . The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further illuminated the gaps and disparities that already existed in both the pregnant and non-pregnant populations. Data from the CDC [86] as well as the UK Obstetric Surveillance System [87] have demonstrated that as with the non-pregnant population, Black and Hispanic pregnant women have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 infections during pregnancy. Though echocardiography is widely utilized in the clinical care of pregnant women with preexisting cardiovascular disease, further prospective studies are required to improve our understanding of best practices for its use in the context of pregnancy, including appropriate screening intervals for various cardiovascular conditions. This may be particularly true for the postpartum period during which women remain at elevated risk for adverse cardiovascular events but often do not receive routine screening or care.

Echocardiography can help define, risk-stratify, and monitor these changes throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pregnancy is associated with significant hemodynamic changes, making it a potentially high-risk period for women with underlying cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography remains the preferred modality for diagnosis and monitoring of pregnant women with cardiovascular disease as it is widely available and does not require radiation. This paper reviews the role of echocardiography along the continuum of pregnancy in at-risk patients, with a focus on key cardiac disease states in pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS: In the preconception stage, risk stratification scores such as CARPREG II, ZAHARA and the modified WHO remain central to counseling and planning. As such, echocardiography serves an important role in assessing the severity of pre-existing structural disease. Among women with pre-existing cardiovascular disease who become pregnant—as well as those who develop cardiovascular symptoms during pregnancy—echocardiography is a key imaging tool for assessment of hemodynamic and structural changes and is recommended as the first-line imaging modality when appropriate by both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, routine screening intervals during pregnancy for various cardiac lesions are not well defined, resulting in clinical heterogeneity in care. SUMMARY: Echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice for defining, risk stratifying, and monitoring cardiovascular changes throughout pregnancy. Once identified, at-risk patients should receive careful individual counseling and follow-up with a multidisciplinary team. Echocardiography serves as a widely available tool for serial monitoring of pregnant women with cardiovascular disease throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period."
"The excess burden of cardiovascular mortality experienced by rural communities in the United States (US) has recently come to the forefront of national conversations on health disparities, highlighted by the recent American Heart Association Call to Action on Rural Health [1] . Individuals living in rural communities face significant challenges in achieving optimal cardiovascular health, contributing to well-known rural-urban differences in overall mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden [1] [2] [3] . Importantly, rural-urban disparities have continued to widen in recent years, and rural communities now have over a 20% higher all-cause mortality rate than their urban counterparts [1] . As declines in the CVD mortality rate in the US have stalled, heart failure (HF)-related mortality has begun to increase since 2011 [4] [5] [6] , likely as a result of increasing prevalence of risk factors for HF-related mortality [7] [8] [9] [10] concurrent with poor implementation of guidelinedirected medical therapy and novel therapeutic agents [11, 12] . Several recent studies have demonstrated significant heterogeneity in how age and race-sex subgroups have been affected by these shifting HF-related mortality rates [13, 14] . However, differences in recent HF-related mortality rates between rural and urban adults have not been described, and how rates may differ across age and race-sex subgroups in rural versus urban adults is unknown. Identifying county-level factors that are associated with differences in rural and urban HF-related mortality rates may help to identify potential targets for policy interventions. Thus, the aim of our study was two-fold: first, to quantify national trends in HF-related mortality by conducting a nationwide analysis of HF-related deaths between 2011 and 2018 by rural-urban status overall and stratified by age and race-sex subgroups; and second, to examine the association between county-level factors (demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, risk factor prevalence, and physician density) and excess HF-related mortality in rural compared with urban counties.@story_separate@a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 This study used a serial cross-sectional design in which data were examined to determine the number of HF-related deaths in each county in the US annually between 2011 and 2018. A pre-specified analytic plan was finalized on February 11, 2020. Statistical analysis occurred between February 12 through March 27, 2020. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research Multiple Cause of Death Online Database (CDC WONDER), which captures mortality stratified by age, race, sex, and county [15] . This dataset includes cause of death from death certificates for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Similar to previous studies [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , data on county-level factors were obtained from the US Census Bureau Population and Housing Unit Estimates [21] , Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates Program [22] , Small Area Health Insurance Estimates Program files [23] ; US Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics file [24]; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [25] ; and the Health Resources and Services Administration Area Health Resources File [26] and subsequently linked using county identifiers to the CDC WONDER mortality data. The rationale for our analytic approach is based on the recommendations by the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) who curate and provide access to these nationwide data and is consistent with prior CDC publications [27] [28] [29] [30] . This study was exempt from institutional review board review at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine due to the publicly available, deidentified nature of the data and follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for reporting (S1 Checklist). We obtained data on all HF-related deaths among Black and White US adults aged 35 to 84 between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2018. The study period began at the well-described inflection point in 2011 at which point HF-related mortality in the United States began to increase [4] [5] [6] and extends through the most recent year for which data are publicly available in CDC WONDER, 2018. As HF is generally considered to be a mediator between disease and death rather than an underlying cause of death by nosologists, coding instructions suggest that other diseases be considered the underlying cause of death. Therefore, to capture the broad burden of cardiovascular mortality related to HF, we included decedents in which HF (defined as International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Revision [ICD-10] code I50) was listed as a multiple cause of death with CVD (I00-I78) listed as the underlying cause of death similar to previous studies [10, 14, 31] . We additionally extracted data on age, race, sex, and county from CDC WONDER to characterize individuals who experienced a HF-related death. Race was classified as Black or White. Age was categorized as 35-64 years and 65-84 years based on age of 65 years being required for Medicare eligibility and previously published analyses [5, 10, 14] . Decedents ages 85 years and older were excluded due to low rates of reliability for coding related to cardiovascular causes of mortality in this age group [32] . The subsequent younger and older age group stratifications were chosen on the basis of recent increases in observed cardiovascular-specific HF-related mortality among adults age 35-64 since 2011 [14, 33] . Due to concerns over the reliability of accurate reporting of ethnicity (i.e. Hispanic or Latinx) [15] on death certificate data, we stratified only by race (Black or White), for which death certificates have been shown to be exceedingly accurate [34] . Too few HF-related mortality events precluded the inclusion of other race and ethnicity groups (e.g. Native American, Asian, or Pacific Islander). We utilized the 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties [35] to classify counties as rural (micropolitan and noncore) or urban (large central metro, large fringe metro, medium metro, and small metro) as in prior published analyses. [36] [37] [38] [39] . Publicly available county-level data were obtained regarding percentage of female, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic residents; percentage of residents in poverty (household income below the federal poverty threshold), unemployed, and uninsured (age 18-64 years); median household income of residents; percentage of residents with diabetes and obesity; and number of primary care physicians and cardiologists per 100,000 residents. The sources, files, and years used for primary and sensitivity analyses are detailed in S1 Table. To examine nationwide trends in HF-related mortality, we calculated annual crude and ageadjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) from 2011 to 2018 by rural-urban status for the overall study population as well as in each age and race-sex subgroup. Mortality rates were ageadjusted using the direct method with the 2000 US census as the standard population [40] . To quantify nationwide annual trends in HF-related mortality, we calculated the average annual percent change (AAPC) in AAMR between 2011 and 2018 using the Joinpoint Regression Program version 4.7 (National Cancer Institute). In the nationwide trend analyses, decedents were stratified by rural-urban status, and trends were examined overall and for age and racesex subgroups. We further calculated individual county-level AAMRs from all HF-related deaths that occurred over the entire 8-year study duration. Deaths were combined over the study period in order to maximize county inclusion, as counties with <20 cumulative events were censored for confidentiality purposes or ""unreliable"" reported AAMRs by CDC WONDER. Small numbers of HF-related mortality events at the county level precluded stratifying by race-sex subgroups in the county-level analysis. We then investigated geospatial differences in HF-related mortality by mapping US counties according to their quintile of HF-related AAMR. Mapping was performed using ArcGIS version 10.6.1 (Esri, Redlands, CA). In a cross-sectional county-level analysis, we investigated whether individual county-level factors were associated with overall HF-related mortality rates in 2011-2018. We used multivariable negative binomial regression models to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for HFrelated mortality in rural compared with urban counties stratified by age of decedent. Due to overdispersion of the data used in our regression analyses, we utilized negative binomial regression rather than Poisson regression. We first modeled the unadjusted association between rural status and county-level AAMR (Model 1). Models 2-5 adjusted for individual county-level covariate categories, including demographic characteristics (Model 2; percent of residents over age 65 years, percent of female residents, percent of non-Hispanic Black residents, and percent of Hispanic residents), socioeconomic characteristics (Model 3; percent of residents in poverty, percent of residents unemployed, percent of uninsured residents age 18-64, and median household income), prevalence of clinical risk factors (Model 4; percent of residents with self-reported diabetes and obesity), and physician density (Model 5; number of PCPs and number of cardiologists per 100,000 residents). Model 6 adjusted for all covariates included in models 1-5 in one model. We also investigated the association of each individual county-level factor with HF-related mortality in the fully adjusted model by stratifying counties by quintiles of each factor and examining the IRR for HF-related mortality relative to the lowest quintile of each county-level factor. Our modeling strategy was designed to provide insight into the association of both broad categories of covariates (i.e. demographic characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics, risk factor prevalence, and physician density) and individual county-level covariates (e.g. percentage of county residents who are uninsured) to rural-urban disparities in HF-related mortality. Individual county-level covariates were chosen based upon known association with HF and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality with reliable, publicly available county-level data and consistent with prior publications examining differences in county-level mortality broadly in heart disease [16] . Finally, we conducted sensitivity analyses in which we repeated negative binomial regression modeling using the most recent publicly available county-level factors (S1 Table) . STATA/IC software version 15.1 (College Station, TX) was used for all statistical analyses. Two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Between 2011 and 2018, 742,619 HF-related deaths occurred among adults age 35 to 84 years in the US, including 162,314 rural and 580,305 urban deaths (S2 Table) . In every year, HFrelated AAMRs were higher for rural compared with urban adults (e.g., 73. Table 1 ). Regardless of rural-urban status, a greater relative annual increase in HF-related mortality rates occurred for younger (AAPC = +4.6% [95% CI: 3.7-5.5%] and +4.4 [95% CI: 4.0-4.9%] for rural and urban, respectively) compared with older adults (AAPC = +1.3% [95% CI: 0.9-1.8%] and +1.2 [95% CI: 0.7-1.7%] for rural and urban, respectively). After stratifying by rural-urban status, race-sex subgroups also demonstrated differences in HF-related mortality trends ( . Young, rural Black men had the largest AAPC in HF-related mortality over the study period at an average of +6.1% (95% CI: 3.7 to 8.5%) per year. Similar disparities existed between race-sex subgroups in young urban adults. Older urban White women were the only subgroup that did not experience a significant increase in HF-related mortality over the study period. Geospatial analysis of combined county-level HF-related deaths from 2011 to 2018 demonstrated marked county-level variation in HF-related mortality rates (Fig 2) . Counties at the 90 th percentiles had a 2.3-fold higher AAMR compared with counties at the 10 th percentile (AAMR = 100.3 and 43.6 per 100,000 population for 90 th and 10 th percentiles, respectively). Counties in the highest quintile of HF-related AAMR (highest rates of HF-related mortality) were predominantly rural counties in the South whereas counties in the lowest quintile (lowest rates) were predominantly urban counties located in the Northeast and Florida peninsula. The West census region demonstrated significant geospatial heterogeneity in HF-related mortality rates regardless of rural-urban status. Descriptions of socioeconomic and demographic factors, risk factor prevalence, and physician density in rural and urban counties included in the cross-sectional county-level analyses are detailed in S3 Table. Of note, there were no practicing cardiologists in 51.1% and 74.9% of Table 1 . Age-adjusted mortality rates and average annual change in heart failure-related mortality between rural versus urban adults, overall and stratified by age and race-sex subgroups, center for disease control and prevention wide-ranging online data for epidemiologic research 2011-2018. rural counties included in the county-level analyses of younger and older decedents, respectively. Unadjusted negative binomial regression models using individual county-level HFrelated AAMRs showed that rural counties experienced significantly higher HF-related mortality rates compared with urban counties ( ; Fig 3) . In separate regression models, the IRR for HF-related mortality in rural versus urban counties was significantly lower after separately adjusting for socioeconomic factors (IRR = 1.08 [95% CI: 1.03-1.14] and 1.01 [95% CI: 0.99-1.04] among younger and older adults, respectively) or risk factor prevalence (IRR = 1.25 [95% CI: 1.18-1.31] and 1.08 [95% CI: 1.06-1.10] among younger and older adults, respectively). Adjustment for demographic factors or physician density did not result in significant changes to the IRR. In fully-adjusted models for both younger and older adults, rural counties demonstrated moderately higher HF-related mortality when compared with urban counties (IRR = 1.10 [95% CI: 1.04-1.16] and 1.04 [95% CI: 1.02-1.07] for younger and older adults, respectively). In a sensitivity analysis using county-level factors from the end of the study period compared with the beginning of the study period (2016-2018 vs. 2010-2011), the association between rural status and HF-related mortality was largely unchanged (S4 Table) . Within each category, AAMRs varied across quintiles of the individual county-level covariates in the fully adjusted model with significant differences between urban and rural counties (Fig 4, S5 Table) . Socioeconomic characteristics were consistently associated with differences in HF-related mortality, particularly median household income and the percent of residents who were uninsured. Higher density of PCPs was associated with significantly lower HFrelated mortality rates in younger adults in rural counties, and higher density of cardiologists was associated with lower HF-related mortality rates for younger adults regardless of ruralurban status.  In this nationwide study, we found marked county-level variation in HF-related mortality rates across the US with a significantly greater burden in rural counties, especially those in the South. HF-related mortality rates increased in both rural and urban counties with greater increases in HF-related mortality among younger compared with older adults between 2011 and 2018. Models accounting for differences in county-level factors significantly attenuated the excess in HF-related mortality rates in rural versus urban counties. Our data extend and expand upon prior reports by highlighting growing disparities in HFrelated mortality rates between rural and urban areas. The geographic distribution of HFrelated mortality rates in the US presented here is consistent with previous reports of higher HF hospitalization rates and greater prevalence of HF risk factors such as diabetes and obesity in the South [41, 42] . States in the South have consistently had higher overall CVD mortality rates compared with the rest of the country [43, 44] . Our data extend these previous analyses by demonstrating significant county-level heterogeneity in HF-related mortality rates, identifying the need to focus on the community level for prevention. This marked county-level variation prompted us to identify key county-level factors that appear to contribute to the observed heterogeneity in HF-related mortality rates. Adjustment for county-level socioeconomic status resulted in the largest attenuation in excess HF-related mortality rates in rural compared with urban counties. These results are in agreement with previous studies demonstrating the important relationship between county-level socioeconomic characteristics and mortality in rural counties [2, 36, 45] and highlight that the observed rural-urban disparities in HF-related mortality are likely a reflection of social and economic differences between rural and urban communities. While rural status was associated with marginally higher HF-related mortality rates in our fully-adjusted model, this is likely due to unmeasured risk factor exposures to such as diet, wealth, and lifetime exposure to cardiovascular risk factors. Our results do not identify a significant contribution of density of PCPs and cardiologists to county-level HF-related mortality. However, there appears to be a modest but significantly lower HF-related mortality rates with greater physician density among young rural adults with minimal to no effect in older rural adults when examined by quintiles (Fig 4) . Basu et al. recently demonstrated that county-level cardiovascular mortality rates were lower by 3.0 and 4.9 deaths per 100,000 population with greater density of PCPs and cardiologists of 10 per 100,000 county residents, respectively, between 2002 and 2015 [46] . They also found PCP density in rural counties declined twice as much as urban counties between 2002-2015, and nearly 300 counties had no PCPs at all in 2015. An even larger disparity exists in the access to specialists like cardiologists in rural compared with urban areas; among the rural counties included in our analysis, over half had no practicing cardiologists. Interestingly, however, we found that the IRR between rural and urban counties was not significantly different when controlling for physician density continuously compared with the unadjusted model (Fig 3) . Because changes in physician density act upstream in the causal pathway of HF-related mortality, changes in county-level HF-related mortality may not be manifested until several years after the corresponding change in physician density. Lack of access to both PCPs and specialists in rural areas may also reflect and be compounded by recent trends in availability of local inpatient hospital care, an important aspect of the management of chronic HF. Over the past decade, rural counties have experienced disproportionate rates of hospital closures, and in the six years following a hospital closure, rural counties experienced an 8.2% decrease in both PCPs and medical specialists [47] . Expansion of Medicaid coverage may be a viable health policy intervention to target HF-related mortality rates as rates of hospital closure have been lower in states that expanded Medicaid in part due to uninsured patients gaining Medicaid coverage, particularly in rural counties [48, 49] . It will be important for future studies to investigate local changes in HF-related mortality rates following these drastic shifts in access to health insurance, physicians, and hospital care, particularly among rural communities. Telemedicine may also be an effective way to mitigate the large differences in access to care among rural patients and potentially reduce rural-urban disparities in HF prevention and management. This is of particular importance in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic when telemedicine has become a more common mode of care delivery for chronic disease management. Several different forms of telemedicine interventions have been proposed in the HF setting, including telephone-based support [50] [51] [52] [53] and telemonitoring of clinical status (i.e. blood pressure, body weight, and ECG monitoring) [53, 54] . Meta-analyses have suggested that telemedicine interventions may be effective in HF patients with significant reductions in HF readmissions, HF-related mortality, and all-cause mortality [55, 56] . However, several recent large clinical trials have failed to show a benefit [50, 54] . The use of easily obtained surrogate measures for clinical status in HF patients such as body weight changes may limit the accuracy of clinical assessment and prevent providers from acting early enough in the disease processes to prevent adverse outcomes. More sensitive measures for worsening clinical status or direct measurement of clinical status with wearables or implanted devices may prove useful in future telemedicine trials [57] . Despite these limitations, telemedicine interventions, if optimized, have the potential to change the landscape of HF management specifically for rural populations who otherwise lack access to specialist care. We also demonstrate that recent increases in HF-related mortality are different between racesex subgroups. Data on the interaction between rural-urban status and race are sparse. One study in the REGARDS cohort demonstrated that Southern, low-income rural Black participants had 85% higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with White participants and over 50% higher risk compared with other Black participants [58] . We found that young Black adults have experienced markedly higher HF-related mortality rates compared with their White peers. Strikingly, between 2011 and 2018, HF-related mortality among young rural Black men increased over 45% (AAMR 35.9 [31.8-40 .0] per 100,000 population in 2011 versus 52.3 [47.4-57.3] in 2018) compared with a 33% increase in young rural White men (AAMR 15.6 [14.8-16.4] in 2011 versus 20.8 [19.8-21.7] in 2018). If current trends continue, HFrelated AAMR among young rural Black men will double by the year 2023 when compared with 2011. Strengths of our study include broad capture of all cardiovascular deaths in which HF was included as a contributing cause from the multiple cause of death files. This is an important distinction as previous studies that have investigated county-level HF-related mortality have measured HF as an underlying cause of death [2] . HF is often erroneously listed on death certificates as the underlying cause of death when the true underlying cause of death is either poorly understood or an alternative cause that subsequently resulted in HF such as coronary artery disease [59, 60] . By specifying HF as a contributing cause, we are better able to capture decedents in whom HF was a significant contributing diagnosis. Additionally, our study utilizes nationwide data from all death certificates in the US over the 8-year study period. This allowed us to accurately characterize trends, geographic variation, and rural-urban disparities on the national level. Finally, we leveraged and integrated multiple large, publicly available data sets to identify county-level factors that may contribute to HF-related mortality. Our study should also be interpreted in the context of several limitations. The mortality rates and covariate data used in this study were aggregate data on the county level, and individual-level characteristics of decedents were not available. As such, we could not include the age of individual decedents in our regression modeling strategies. Counties with low event rates over the study period were omitted from the cross-sectional county-level IRR analysis due to unreliable mortality rate estimates (13% omitted in the overall county-level analysis, similar to other published studies [16] on county-level HF-related mortality rates). However, all decedents between 2011 and 2018 were included in the analysis of annual trends and rural-urban disparities in HF-related mortality. Furthermore, the purpose of the county-level analysis was to provide an estimate of the association of county-level factors with HF-related mortality. While systemic differences likely exist between included and excluded counties, the biological contribution of these characteristics to HF-related mortality rates should not differ. Counties spanning large geographical areas may be significantly heterogeneous with mixed rural and urban neighborhoods. Future dedicated analyses of differences in HF-related mortality over smaller geographical areas (i.e. congressional district) may provide additional insight. Counties with low populations may have high variance in AAMRs. However, because counties with less than 20 HF-related mortality events were excluded from the study, the counties at the highest risk for significantly inflated or deflated AAMRs have been excluded. Decedents aged 85 years or older were excluded from the study given concerns related to accuracy of death certificate coding in this age range [32] . While this introduces potential bias, excluding decedents aged 85 years or older likely resulted in lower, conservative estimates of HF-related mortality, but was unlikely to significantly affect annual trends and between-group differences in AAMRs. Mortality rates in this study are based on death certificate data and ICD-10 codes, which is subject to miscoding and does not distinguish between HF phenotypes such as HF with reduced or preserved ejection fraction. Instead, the definition used in this study encompasses a comprehensive burden of overall HF-related mortality. Finally, county-level data on other clinical and behavioral risk factors for HF (e.g. hypertension, smoking, and diet) were not publicly available to be included in this analysis, but represent important factors on the causal pathway to HF.@story_separate@Rural adults in the US experience higher rates of HF-related mortality compared with urban adults. County-level factors such as socioeconomic status and risk factor prevalence account for a significant portion of the higher rates of HF-related mortality observed. Our study decomposing the rural-urban disparity in HF-related mortality identifies complex and multilevel factors and suggests that extensive clinical and public health interventions targeting health and economic policy, socioeconomic disparities, access to care, and clinical and behavioral risk factors will be required to reduce this disparity.

Data sources as in","BACKGROUND: Adults in rural counties in the United States (US) experience higher rates broadly of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with adults in urban counties. Mortality rates specifically due to heart failure (HF) have increased since 2011, but estimates of heterogeneity at the county-level in HF-related mortality have not been produced. The objectives of this study were 1) to quantify nationwide trends by rural-urban designation and 2) examine county-level factors associated with rural-urban differences in HF-related mortality rates. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We queried CDC WONDER to identify HF deaths between 2011–2018 defined as CVD (I00-78) as the underlying cause of death and HF (I50) as a contributing cause of death. First, we calculated national age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) and examined trends stratified by rural-urban status (defined using 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme), age (35–64 and 65–84 years), and race-sex subgroups per year. Second, we combined all deaths from 2011–2018 and estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) in HF-related mortality for rural versus urban counties using multivariable negative binomial regression models with adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, risk factor prevalence, and physician density. Between 2011–2018, 162,314 and 580,305 HF-related deaths occurred in rural and urban counties, respectively. AAMRs were consistently higher for residents in rural compared with urban counties (73.2 [95% CI: 72.2–74.2] vs. 57.2 [56.8–57.6] in 2018, respectively). The highest AAMR was observed in rural Black men (131.1 [123.3–138.9] in 2018) with greatest increases in HF-related mortality in those 35–64 years (+6.1%/year). The rural-urban IRR persisted among both younger (1.10 [1.04–1.16]) and older adults (1.04 [1.02–1.07]) after adjustment for county-level factors. Main limitations included lack of individual-level data and county dropout due to low event rates (<20). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in county-level factors may account for a significant amount of the observed variation in HF-related mortality between rural and urban counties. Efforts to reduce the rural-urban disparity in HF-related mortality rates will likely require diverse public health and clinical interventions targeting the underlying causes of this disparity."
"Positive-strand RNA viruses cover more than onethird of all virus genera and infect a wide range of hosts, for example, the plants, animals, and humans. Examples of this class of viruses include poliovirus, coxsackievirus, EMCV, HCV, HAV, SARS-CoV, West Nile virus, and dengue fever virus [1] . Positive-strand RNA viruses, either enveloped or non-enveloped, consist of a single positive-strand of RNA acting as mRNA to direct the synthesis of viral proteins. Viral structural proteins make up the viral capsid, and non-structural proteins, such as viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, function to process the viral polyprotein and catalyze the synthesis of the viral progeny genomes, respectively. Similar to other viral pathogens, positive-strand RNA viruses utilize and subvert the host cellular machinery to support their life cycle. Among the many host pathways that can be modulated by positive strand RNA viruses, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the major intracellular protein degradation pathway, has recently received considerable attention because the interaction between viruses and the UPS has been found to play important roles in many aspects of the viral life cycle [2, 3] . For positive-strand RNA viruses, it has been shown that an appropriate stoichiometric ratio of viral structural to non-structural proteins is essential for effective viral replication [4] [5] [6] . There is evidence that too much of certain viral non-structural proteins are disadvantageous for certain viruses to successfully replicate [6] . To ensure a proper ratio of viral proteins, some positive-strand RNA viruses employ the host regulatory mechanisms, for example, the UPS, to degrade excess viral proteins to prevent interference of these proteins with the viral replication. In addition, post-translational modification of some viral proteins mediated by ubiquitin and ubiquitinlike proteins of the UPS has also been demonstrated as an important means to regulate viral protein function without altering protein stability [2] . The objective of this review is to present an overview of current knowledge on how positive-strand RNA viruses interact and subvert the host UPS, a central component of the host protein degradation system, to maintain optimal levels of viral proteins and to modify the functions of virus-encoded proteins. The possibility that UPS-mediated viral protein degradation may also constitute a host defense process against some positive-stranded RNA viral infections will be briefly discussed as well. How positive-stranded RNA viruses utilize the UPS to modify the level/function of host proteins to generate a favorable environment for their infection will not be the focus of the current review (please refer to other reviews on this topic [2, 7, 8] ).@story_separate@In eukaryotic cells, the best-known function of the UPS is to degrade misfolded/damaged proteins or intracellular regulatory proteins that are involved in a variety of cellular activities, including cell-cycle regulation, membrane protein trafficking, transcription, antigen presentation, and signal transduction [9, 10] . Protein degradation via the UPS starts with the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a target protein (a process referred to as ubiquitylation) ( Figure 1 ). This process consists of multi-step ATP-dependent enzyme reactions. First, the ubiquitin is activated by ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 to form an E1-ubiquitin thioester intermediate. Figure 1 . Schematic illustration of post-translational modification of viral proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Post-translational modification mediated by mono-ubiquitylation or sumoylation is necessary for the regulation of viral protein functions. Proteasomal degradation mediated through either ubiquitin-dependent or ubiquitin-independent mechanisms controls the expression levels of viral proteins. The harmony of these modifications is required to maintain the appropriate level and function of viral proteins, which are crucial for successful infection The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 that subsequently transfers the ubiquitin to the target protein either directly or with the help of a ubiquitin ligase enzyme E3 by forming an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and the e-amino group of a lysine residue on the target protein [11] . The lysine residue of the conjugated ubiquitin is attached by another ubiquitin, consecutively, resulting in the formation of a poly-ubiquitin chain. The ubiquitin-tagged substrate protein is then delivered to the 20S proteasome, and the polypeptide is hydrolyzed into short oligopeptides and the free ubiquitin is recycled through the action of de-ubiquitinating enzymes [12, 13] . De-ubiquitinating enzyme plays important roles in UPS as it proofreads ubiquitinprotein conjugates, processes inactive ubiquitin precursors, and keeps sustainable proteolysis by maintaining sufficient ubiquitin within the cell [14] . The 20S proteasome consists of two 7 subunit-composed outer a-rings and two inner b-rings. The function of the a-ring is to translocate the target protein to the core of the b-rings. The b-rings possess the catalytic property to conduct the action of the degradation. The 20S proteasome is normally inactive and inaccessible to protein substrates. Proteasome activators (PA), such as PA700 (also known as 19S proteasome), PA28 (also known as REG or 11S proteasome), and PA200, bind and activate the 20S proteasome [15] . Although the function of PA200 remains to be fully characterized, PA700 has been shown to mainly mediate ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation, whereas PA28 facilitates substrate degradation in a ubiquitin and ATP-independent manner [15] (Figure 1 ). Unlike protein modification by poly-ubiquitylation that mostly influences the stability of substrate protein, attachment of a single ubiquitin, a process called mono-ubiquitylation, regulates the function of target proteins without targeting them for degradation ( Figure 1 ). Mono-ubiquitylation has been shown to alter protein sub-cellular localization, regulate transcriptional and enzymatic activities, and change binding affinities to their partners [16, 17] . In addition to ubiquitin, several ubiquitin-like (UBL) proteins have been found to also function as protein modifiers to regulate a variety of cellular functions, including transcription, DNA repair, signal transduction, and cell cycle control, by posttranslational modification of target proteins. The best-characterized family of UBL proteins is the small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO), including SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 [18, 19] . Protein modification by sumoylation is directed by an enzymatic cascade parallel to that involved in ubiquitylation ( Figure 1 ). SUMO is activated in an ATP-dependent manner by an E1-activating enzyme consisting of a heterodimer of the Aos1 and Uba2 proteins. After activation, SUMO is transferred to the SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. Three classes of SUMO E3-ligases have been reported, RanBP2, PIAS and the Polycomb protein Pc2. The sumoylation target is a lysine that occurs in the consensus motif ΨKXE where Ψ is a hydrophobic amino acid and X is any residue. Like mono-ubiquitylation, sumoylation does not target proteins for degradation, but instead, regulates protein function and sub-cellular localization [20, 21] . A growing body of evidence suggests that sumoylation is particularly important in the regulation of transcription [22] . The role of sumoylation in controlling the function of viral proteins by posttranslational modification has also been increasingly recognized [18, 23] . Another well-studied UBL molecule is interferonstimulated gene 15 (ISG15). Expression of ISG15 is highly induced upon viral infection and interferon stimulation [24] . Protein modification by ISG15, termed ISGylation, occurs in a mode similar to ubiquitylation and sumoylation that requires the sequential action of E1 (UBE1L), E2 (UbcH8), and E3 enzymes [24] . The process of ISG15 conjugation can be reversed by de-ISGylating enzymes [24] . Function of ISGylation has not been fully understood, but it is thought to alter the biological activities of the target proteins or compete for ubiquitylation and play significant roles in many cellular functions [ , there were reports that the host ISG15 conjugations system can also be exploited by HCV to facilitate viral production [29-31]. The exact mechanism for the pro-viral function of ISGylation remains unclear; however, it is speculated that ISGylation of HCV proteins or host proteins critical for HCV life-cycle promotes HCV production by altering the function or preventing target proteins from ubiquitinmediated degradation [31]. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalyzes the synthesis of new viral RNA genomes from the original viral RNA [32] . Appropriate balance of viral RdRp concentration in infected cells was found to be a key factor affecting the membrane rearrangements, RNA replication, and RNA recombination efficiencies [33] [34] [35] . Transgenic overexpression of the 3D RdRp of the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus has been shown to have antiviral effects against the infection of this virus itself and other viruses [6, 36] . Although the detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated, changes of the stoichiometry have been proposed to be one mechanism responsible for such antiviral properties of overexpressed 3D [37] . These studies imply that maintaining an appropriate level of RdRp is important for viral growth [6] . Indeed, the expression levels of RdRp of Sindbis virus, TYMV, HCV, and HAV have been reported to be regulated via UPS-regulated protein proteolysis [5, 19, [38] [39] [40] . It was shown that the RNA polymerase (NSP4) of Sindbis virus is degraded by the proteasome through the ubiquitin-dependent N-end rule pathway [38] . The N-end rule is a highly conserved degradation mechanism relating the stability of a protein with the nature of its N-terminal residue [41]. TYMV RdRp was also shown to be degraded by the proteasome at a late stage of viral infection [5] . This UPS-mediated TYMV RdRp degradation requires prerequisite phosphorylation at two residues (threonine-64 and serine-80) localized within the putative N-terminal PEST sequence (P, proline; E, glutamic acid; S, serine; T, threonine), a known protein degradation motif [19, 42] . The RdRps of HAV and HCV are another two examples of UPS-mediated degradation [40] . The HAV 3D polymerase and its precursors were observed to be present at low levels in infected cells [43] and was demonstrated to be poly-ubiquitinated for rapid proteasomal degradation [40] . Nonstructural 5B (NS5B) protein, the RdRp of HCV, was reported to bind to a cellular ubiquitin-like protein [39] . Overexpression of this protein, but not mutant lacking the NS5B-binding domain, increases the poly-ubiquitylation of NS5B and significantly decreases its stability [39] . What is the significance of RdRp degradation during viral infection? Low amounts of RdRp may be required for regulating the switch between the negative-strand and the positive-strand viral RNA synthesis during viral replication [5] . It is also possible that maintaining a low concentration of RdRp is a strategy for virus to preserve its genome integrity [5] . Furthermore, it is conceivable that keeping a low quantity of viral proteins may be beneficial for virus to escape host immune surveillance. As discussed earlier, in addition to UPS-mediated rapid turnover of viral proteins, viral protein modification by ubiquitin and/or UBLs also plays a key role in the regulation of viral protein function. It has been recently shown that coxsackieviral 3D RdRp can be post-translationally modified by mono-ubiquitylation [44] . Although the specific E3 ligase responsible for 3D ubiquitylation and the exact ubiquitylation site remain undetermined, this modification appears to be required for its function in regulating transcription of viral genome [44] . Besides ubiquitylation, it has also been found that the 3D polymerase of coxsackievirus can be sumoylated with SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 (unpublished data). DNA alignment reveals one highly conserved sequence Valine-Lysine-Aspartic acid-Glutamic acid (VKDE), which could be found in the 3D of several different species of enteroviral 3D polymerases, that matches the ΨKXE consensus motif for sumoylation, suggesting that sumoylation may also be required for the regulation of 3D transcriptional activity. Autoproteases are virus-encoded proteases that not only proteolytically process viral polyprotein to yield individual structural and non-structural proteins but also mediate the cleavage of many host proteins essential for transcription/translation and maintenance of cellular structures [45, 46] . The levels of mature 3C protease of EMCV and HAV, both belonging to the picornavirus family, have been found to decrease rapidly after they reach maximum proteolytic activity, about halfway through the infectious cycle [47] [48] [49] [50] . It was later demonstrated that low concentrations of 3C in infected cells are largely attributed to increased protein turnover through ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation [48,51-53]. In the presence of proteasome inhibitors, poly-ubiquitinated 3C protein accumulated and the rate of 3C degradation was significantly reduced [48, 52] . Evidence also suggests that EMCV and HAV exploit the same ubiquitin enzymes for 3C ubiquitylation as 3C proteases of these two viruses were shown to compete with each other for ubiquitin conjugation [48] . Further investigation identified the amino acid sequences 34 LLVRGRTLVV 43 and 32 LGVKDDWLLV 41 that serve as the protein destruction signals for recognition and ubiquitylation of EMCV and HAV 3C proteases, respectively, by the host ubiquitinconjugating system [40,51-53]. Mutations within these sequences lead to increased stability of 3C proteases. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, E3a, has been shown to recognize these destruction signals of EMCV and HAV 3C proteases and catalyze the conjugation of ubiquitin to them [40,51,53]. The 3C protein of another virus in the picornavirus family, enterovirus 71 (EV71) has also been reported to be regulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation [54] . It was found that sumoylation of EV71 3C at lysine 52 promotes its ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation [54] . Virus-encoded proteases are required for successful virus replication via cleaving viral polyprotein precursors and can trigger host cell apoptosis by activating pro-apoptotic mediators and suppressing host protein translation and transcription [55, 56] . Apoptosis at late stages of viral replication can promote viral progeny release. But premature cell death will perturb viral replication before the virus has completed its life cycle. It is therefore speculated that keeping a small amount of 3C protease is necessary, at least at the early stage of viral infection, to prevent premature cell death and allow efficient viral replication. However, the potential significance of UPS targeting viral protease for degradation in host antiviral defense cannot be completely ruled out. In the study of the regulation of HCV proteases, it was found that both enzymatically inactive nonstructural 2/3 (NS2/3) protein and cleaved NS2 protein of HCV are rapidly degraded during the course of viral infection, underlining the importance of tight regulation of these proteins during the viral life cycle [57-59]. The degradation of NS2 was shown to be regulated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner mediated by casein kinase 2 on serine 164 residue [57] . Notably, ubiquitylation appears not to be required for NS2 degradation as NS2 lysine-toarginine mutagenesis does not affect its stability and expression levels [57, 59] . A non-proteasomal degradation pathway, for example, lysosomemediated proteolysis, has also been suggested to be involved in the rapid turnover of NS2 [59] . Not all proteases in the family of positivestranded RNA viruses are regulated by the UPS. The 3C proteases of rhinovirus and poliovirus, similar to those of EMCV and HAV, are present in low concentrations in infected cell [35,60,61]. However, it was found that poliovirus 3C is not conjugated with ubiquitin and remains stable during the viral life cycle [48] . Further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms involved in maintaining low levels of polioviral 3C protease. Possible mechanisms may include blockage of ribosomal read-through and differential processing of polyproteins, leading to reduced production of 3C protease. A recent report has suggested that pseudoknot structures of the SARS-CoV RNA can stop the translation from upstream to downstream encoded viral proteins [62] . Some viral proteases have been shown to possess de-ubiquitinating enzyme activity. It was reported that the papain-like cysteine proteases of coronavirus [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] , hepatitis E virus [69] , and foot-and-mouth disease virus [70] have structural similarity to the cellular de-ubiquitinating enzymes and are able to efficiently hydrolyze ubiquitinated substrates. Although the viral and cellular targets remain largely unknown, the de-ubiquitinating activity of these proteases appears to play a significant role in viral life cycle and in blockage of host innate immunity. Although the structural proteins need to be expressed at higher levels than non-structural proteins [71] , the levels and functions of some viral structural proteins can also be regulated by the UPS. The core protein of HCV is a structural protein that not only packages the viral genomic RNA but also modulates multiple cellular functions, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell transformation, and signal transduction, and contributes to HCV pathogenesis [72, 73] . The stability of HCV core protein has been reported to be regulated by the proteasome in both ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitinindependent manner [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] . It was demonstrated that the E3 ligase, E6-associated protein (E6AP), binds to the core protein of HCV and promotes its ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the proteasome [78] . Ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation mediated by PA28g has also been shown to facilitate the degradation of HCV core protein [76, 79] . PA28g interacts directly with the core protein of HCV in the nucleus and regulates its degradation [76] . In animal experiments, this interaction has been demonstrated to play an important role in HCV pathogenesis as PA28g knockout disrupts the progression of steatosis, hepatocarcinoma, and insulin resistance induced by HCV core protein [74, 75] . Moreover, recent evidence revealed a role for PA28g-mediated and E6AP-mediated degradation of HCV core protein in the regulation of HCV propagation [77] . Recently discovered F protein, a frame-shift product of the core protein of HCV, has also been reported to be directly degraded by the 20S proteasome through a mechanism independent of ubiquitin [81, 82] . The function of HCV F protein remains unclear. Available data suggest a role for F protein in HCV pathogenesis by regulating the expression and activity of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, transcriptional factors, and oncogenes [5, 83, 84] . HCV F protein was found to be very labile with a short half-life (~10 min) and degraded by the proteasome [81, 85] . Further experimentation revealed that the degradation of F protein is ubiquitinindependent as a lysine-less F protein mutant remains unstable and its protein levels do not appears to be affected in a cell line with a temperature-sensitive E1 [82] . It was demonstrated that HCV F protein binds to the a3 subunit of the 20S proteasome and is degraded directly by the 20S proteasome in vitro [82] . The functional significance of F protein degradation in viral replication (pro-viral strategy versus host defense mechanism) warrants future investigation. West Nile virus capsid protein is another example of a viral structural protein being the target of the UPS [86, 87] . The Makorin ring finger protein 1, a member of the Makorin family of proteins, was identified as the E3 ligase facilitating the ubiquitylation and consequent degradation of this capsid protein by the proteasome [86] . In addition to its role in nucleocapsid assembly, the West Nile capsid protein is also involved in viral pathogenesis by inducing apoptosis [88, 89] . Overexpression of Makorin ring finger protein 1 has been shown to result in reduced apoptosis triggered by West Nile virus infection, whereas depletion of this protein promotes viral cytotoxicity [86] . It remains unclear whether such modification and degradation of the capsid protein is a host defense mechanism or a viral strategy to prevent premature cell death. The envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV has been reported to be ubiquitinated in vitro and in cells, likely through its interaction with the N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain-1 of non-structural protein (NSP3) [90] . The coat protein of TMV has also been shown to be modified by mono-ubiquitylation [91] . However, the functional consequence of these posttranslational modifications in the regulation of the viral life cycle and viral pathogenesis is not known and requires further investigation. Besides ubiquitylation, UBL-mediated modification has also been reported for viral structural proteins. The nucleocapsid (N) protein, a structural protein of SARS-CoV, was demonstrated to undergo post-translational modification by sumoylation [92, 93] . Using a yeast two-hybrid system, Ubc9, the E2-conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, was identified as the cellular protein interacting with the SARS-CoV N protein [92] . It was further demonstrated that N protein is covalently modified mainly at lysine 62 residue by SUMO [94] . Further investigation using wild-type N protein and a sumoylation mutant revealed that sumoylation of this protein increases its homo-oligomerization that may play a role in controlling viral replication cycle [94] . Swine fever virus core protein was also found to interact with the intracellular sumoylation pathway [95] . It binds to Ubc9 and SUMO-1 and disruption of these interactions results in attenuated viral virulence, suggesting a regulatory role of SUMO modification in viral infectivity [95] . Dengue virus is a member of the virus family Flaviviridae. Its envelope protein that is responsible for the virus attachment and entry to host cells has been shown to interact directly with SUMO E2 enzyme Ubc9. Further investigation demonstrates that overexpression of Ubc9 reduces the production of infectious virus, suggesting a role for SUMO modification in attenuating viral infectivity [96] . Movement protein (MP) is a non-structural protein encoded by plant viruses to facilitate cell to cell movement. TMV MP was previously observed to be only transiently expressed during virus infection [97] . Further investigation demonstrates that TMV MP is poly-ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome and inhibition Li et al. Li et al. [94] of proteasome function leads to accumulation of MP preferentially on the perinuclear ER [98] . The exact role of UPS-mediated degradation of MP in TMV infection remains to be elucidated. It is speculated that such modification of MP plays a critical role in regulating virus spread by attenuating its damage on ER structure [98] . Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34p has been identified as one of the host proteins binding to the p33 replication protein of Tombusvirus [99] . It was shown that p33 can be ubiquitinated both in vitro and in vivo, and overexpression of Cdc34p increases, whereas down-regulation of Cdc34p reduces Tombusvirus replication [99] . Further investigation identified the lysine residues required for p33 mono-ubiquitylation and demonstrated the functional significance of p33 ubiquitylation in Tombusvirus replication [100] . The interaction between the host UPS and positivestranded RNA viruses is summarized in Table 1 .@story_separate@Current evidence, reviewed herein, strongly supports a notion that the maintenance of appropriate levels of certain viral proteins within infected cells is crucial for successful viral reproduction. Autoproteases at high concentrations have been suggested to trigger apoptosis of the host cells by cleaving cellular proteins [55,56], whereas high amounts of RdRps have been shown to perturb the process of appropriate viral packaging and even become antiviral when expressed at high levels [6, 36] . Growing studies have suggested that positive-stranded RNA viruses manipulate the host UPS for the degradation of excess viral proteins that disturb efficient viral growth and for the modulation of viral protein function through ubiquitin-mediated or UBL-mediated modification ( Table 1 and Figure 1 ). These findings will not only be able to explain the differential expression of various viral proteins but also provide a drug target through a thorough understanding of the mechanism regulating the levels and activities of viral proteins.","Positive‐stranded RNA viruses, like many other viruses, have evolved to exploit the host cellular machinery to their own advantage. In eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin‐proteasome system (UPS) that serves as the major intracellular pathway for protein degradation and modification plays a crucial role in the regulation of many fundamental cellular functions. A growing amount of evidence has suggested that the UPS can be utilized by positive‐sense RNA viruses. The UPS eliminates excess viral proteins that prevent viral replication and modulates the function of viral proteins through post‐translational modification mediated by ubiquitin or ubiquitin‐like proteins. This review will discuss the current understanding of how positive RNA viruses have evolved various mechanisms to usurp the host UPS to modulate the function and stability of viral proteins. In addition to the pro‐viral function, UPS‐mediated viral protein degradation may also constitute a host defense process against some positive‐stranded RNA viral infections. This issue will also be discussed in the current review. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical condition characterized by progressive hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The most common underlying condition is severe infection (e.g., sepsis/septic shock with or without severe pneumonia) due to various microbial pathogens, which include bacteria, viruses, fungi, rickettsia, and parasites. The histological characteristics of ARDS include acute diffuse inflammatory lung injury, which results in decreased barrier function of alveolar capillary endothelial cells, increased permeability, and exudation of a large amount of protein, red blood cells, and liquids. Subsequently, this leads to osmotic pulmonary edema and transparent membrane formation, which markedly affect ventilation (Thompson et al., 2017) . Globally, there are more than 3 million reported cases of ARDS each year with a mortality rate of more than 40% (Fan et al., 2018) . At present, the global spread of covid-19 virus, ARDS is one of the most important causes of death in covid-19 patients. Including 38 studies involving 3,062 patients with covid-19, the incidence of respiratory failure or ARDS was 19.5%, and the mortality was 5.5% (Zhu et al., 2020) . Although the pathogenesis of ARDS is still unclear, the key pathological features of ARDS are enhanced number and activation of inflammatory cells in the lungs, which trigger aberrant proinflammatory cytokine release and inflammation cascades. Consequently, this causes extensive damage to the microvascular endothelial cells . The treatment for ARDS is mainly based on protective mechanical ventilation, restrictive fluid management, and other supportive treatments, as well as on the control of the primary disease. There is an urgent need to develop a safe and effective therapy for ARDS based on the detailed pathogenetic mechanism. One meta-analysis confirmed (Wan et al., 2018) that the combination treatment with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine decreases mortality among patients with ARDS. TCM comprises various components that act synergistically to achieve multiple effects (Weng et al., 2018) . Compared to the single blocker, TCM may be more effective in clinical application for the prevention and treatment of ARDS. Yiqi Huayu Jiedu Decoction (YQHYJD) is an empirical prescription that was developed by Professor Huaitang Du, a senior traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, through years of clinical practice. YQHYJD is a traditional Chinese decoction used for treating patients exhibiting acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mild ARDS. YQHYJD comprises 8 Chinese herbal components. Several studies have indicated that the ingredients of YQHYJD, especially Hedysarum multijugum Maxim, Panax notoginseng, and Scutellariae radix, exhibit anti-inflammatory activities in the lungs. One study reported that astragaloside IV in Hedysarum multijugum Maxim effectively inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute inflammatory responses by modulating the nuclear factor (NF)-kB and AP-1 signaling pathways (Zhang and Frei, 2015) . Pretreatment with Astragalus polysaccharides markedly attenuated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a-induced upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), as well as augmented NF-kB translocation. Moreover, Astragalus polysaccharides significantly reduced apoptosis, reactive oxygen species generation, and adhesion function damage in the TNF-a-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. This indicated that Astragalus polysaccharides may be used to treat and prevent endothelial cell injury-related diseases (Zhu et al., 2013) . In addition to exerting direct inhibitory effects on the proinflammatory molecules, Ginsenoside Rb1 in Panax notoginseng is reported to attenuate LPS-induced lung injury by inhibiting the inflammatory signaling pathway (Yuan et al., 2014) . Moreover, baicalein in Scutellariae radix inhibits matrix metalloproteinase expression, which is partly mediated by suppressing the activation of the p38 and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signaling pathways (Chen et al., 2015) . Additionally, baicalein attenuates lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1)mediated endothelial oxidative dysfunction by modulating the AMPK/PKC/NADPH oxidase/NF-kB signaling pathway. Therefore, baicalein decreases the NADPH oxidase-induced reactive oxygen species formation and dysfunction of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1) (Tsai et al., 2016) . Previously, we had demonstrated that YQHYJD can significantly alleviate the lung and tissue damage by decreasing the inflammatory cell infiltration and the expression of inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a in the serum (Li et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017) . Furthermore, YQHYJD improved the lung coefficient and lung permeability index in the ARDS rat model and decreased the expression of key proteins involved in the proinflammatory signaling pathways, such as NF-kB and p38 . Another study reported that YQHYJD has a protective effect on LPS-induced ARDS in rats, which may be related to enhanced expression of IL-4 and IL-10 in the serum (Luo C. Y. et al., 2019) . Here, a proteomic method that conforms to the characteristics and laws of TCM was applied to further elucidate the molecular therapeutic mechanism of YQHYJD in ARDS. This study applied high-throughput proteomics technology and used rat lung tissue to analyze the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) among the experimental groups. Additionally, the proteinprotein interaction network and the genes and pathways affected by YQHYJD treatment were analyzed in the ARDS model. The key proteins were validated and the therapeutic mechanism of YQHYJD in ARDS was elucidated ( Figure 1 ).@story_separate@Escherichia coli LPS (batch number 110M4086V, 100 mg), Bicinchoninic acid kit, and tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling kit were purchased from Sigma, USA. Liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC-MS) grade acetonitrile and formic acid were purchased from Fisher Chemical Company. YQHYJD comprises 8 Chinese herbal components (Table 1) , the information of plants was collected from Kew Royal Botanic Garden (https://mpns.science.kew.org/). The herbal components were provided by the Institute of Chinese Medicine of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, which were used to prepare the Chinese herbal extract (batch number: 20170320). The quality control for all the materials was validated according to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The LC-MS analysis was performed to characterize the YQHYJD extract ( Figure 2) . The chemical constituents of YQHYJD extract were profiled using the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography system coupled with a high-resolution electrospray ionization mass detector. In total, 18 clean-grade 6-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats with an average weight of 200 ± 10 g were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. The rats were maintained (six rats per cage) at the Barrier Laboratory of Experimental Animal Center of Dongzhimen Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. All rats were fed with the same diet. The experiments were performed after 1-week of Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into Control group, Model group, and YQHYJD group. They were intervened by Sham, LPS, LPS+YQHYJD, respectively. The quality of YQHYJD aqueous solution was controlled by Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was detected in lung tissue of rats in each group to determine the intervention effect of YQHYJD on LPS induced ARDS. Tandem mass tag (TMT) was performed in lung tissue of rats in each group to detect the differential proteins among groups. The target pathway and potential targets of YQHYJD were obtained by bioinformatics analysis. Finally, Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was used to verify the potential targets of YQHYJD on LPS induced ARDS.  The rats in each group were fed on a normal diet. The rats in each group were fed with normal diet. The YQHYJD group was given in the morning, once a day, at the dose of 12.2 mg/kg body weight, to prepare 1/100 body weight solution. The normal control group (Control) and model control group (Model) were given 1/100 body weight distilled water. All rats were given gavage for 7 days. The ARDS animal model was administered with LPS by a single intravenous injection to induce a systemic inflammatory response, which is the most common cause of ARDS. The phenotype of this animal model is consistent with the pathological features of ARDS lung tissue (Jiang et al., 2016) . On day 7 after 6 h of gavage solution, the Control group was injected with 2 mg/kg normal saline, while the Model group and YQHYJD groups were injected with 2 mg/kg LPS solution through the tail vein. After 16 h, the rats in all three groups were allowed to fast for 8 h and dissected under anesthesia. The animals were euthanized by intra-peritoneal injection of 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital. The right lower lung was subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining. The left lung was used for proteomic screening, while the right lung accessory leaf was used for mass spectrometry analysis. The lung tissue of each group of rats stored at -80°C was lysed and centrifuged several times. The tissue lysates of each group were stored separately. Each sample group was dispensed into 3 EP tubes. One tube containing about 30 µl sample was treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate to clarify the protein extract. In the second tube containing about 30 µl sample, protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. The remaining sample in the third tube was subjected to protease digestion to obtain the membrane peptide. The peptide was purified by C18 column extraction. The dried peptide was quantified by the bicinchoninic acid method. The peptide was dissolved and incubated with the labeling reagent under room temperature for 2 h in the dark. The sample was vacuum dried and subjected to one-dimensional LC-MS analysis. Eighteen lung tissue samples from three experimental groups were separately subjected to trypsin digestion. The polypeptide concentration in the digested sample was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method. Equal amount of test protein samples (10.5 µg; 0.5 µg) and iRT standard peptide was mixed to obtain a mixed sample. PRM polypeptide screening and analysis were performed using the Skyline 3.6 software. Initially, the mixed peptide samples were screened. The substrates that had a better profile in the rat lung tissue proteome database and that can be identified in the mixed sample or that have a high signal to noise ratio peak were selected for subsequent validation. Next, the selected polypeptides were subjected to PRM analysis. Eighteen samples were validated separately. The target polypeptide was verified in each sample by scheduled PRM. To ensure data quality, the mixed samples were analyzed before and after the loading of all samples and between every five samples. The instrument signal was stable throughout the analysis. Furthermore, iRT standard peptide was added to each sample to observe the stability of chromatographic retention time during the analysis. Two technical repeat analyses were performed for each sample. To reduce systematic errors, different sets of samples were randomly sequenced for mass spectrometry. In the Skyline software, the correct peaks were The peaks 1-7 correspond to Cynaroside (1), Calycosin-7-glucoside (2), ginsenoside-Rg1 (3), ginsenoside-Re (4), astragaloside IV (5), Chlorogenic acid (6), and notoginsenoside r1 (7). manually selected and all peptide results from all samples were exported and quantified. The data were retrieved using the Proteome Discoverer software suite (Version 2.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The total proteins in the samples were obtained after data retrieval. The relative quantity of each protein in different groups was determined. The differentially expressed proteins between Model and Control are called DEPs1 and which between Model group and YQHYJD group are called DEPs2. The proteins with p-value <0.05 and absolute value of log(fold-change)(FC)>0.1 were considered as DEPs. Metascape (https://metascape.org/gp/index.html) is used for gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enrichment analysis of DEPs. The R Version 3.5.1 was used for graphical display. P-value scoring and Gene proportion are used to select important GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathways. The pathological changes in the lung tissue and the protective effect of YQHYJD in ARDS rats were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining ( Figure 3A) . The Control group lung tissue exhibited clear and intact alveolar structure with no edema of alveolar septum, no tissue fluid in the alveolar cavity, no inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung tissue. The Model group lung tissue exhibited alveolar and interstitial edema with a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar wall thickening and visible alveolar cavity shrinkage and deformation, partial alveolar collapse, secretions containing red blood cells in the bronchial and alveolar cavities, pulmonary capillary congestion, and edema. Treatment with YQHYJD alleviated the lung tissue damage with less inflammatory cell infiltration and alveolar collapse, decreased bleeding and exudation, and less severe pulmonary microvascular endothelial edema.h The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the samples in each group were clear and the proteins resolved with no obvious diffusion and deformation. The protein aggregation sites were similar and evenly distributed, which indicated that the samples were comparable. After two TMT-labeled replicate experiments, 3,090 proteins were identified in the first round and 3,097 proteins were identified in the second round. In total, 3,348 proteins were identified and quantified. Of these, there were 2,839 common proteins ( Figure  3B ). Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that the samples clustered into the following three groups: Control, Model, and YQHYJD groups ( Figure 3C ). There was little intra-group variability and high inter-group comparability. Compared to the Control group, 294 DEPs were identified in the Model group (p < 0.05 and log FC > 0.1). Of these 294 DEPs, 131 were down-regulated and 163 were up-regulated. Compared to the Model group, 134 DEPs were detected in the YQHYJD group. Of these 134 DEPs, 24 were down-regulated and 110 were up-regulated ( Figure 3D ). See Table S1 for total protein expression data. Specifically, 10 proteins were up-regulated by LPS-induced ARDS, but down-regulated by YQHYJD (Set 1), and 22 proteins were down-regulated by LPS-induced ARDS, but up-regulated by YQHYJD (Set 2). Also, the proteins showing no changes by LPS-induced ARDS, but up-regulated (Set 3) or down-regulated (Set 4) by YQHYJD can augment the therapeutic effect of YQHYJD. 87 proteins showed the augmenting patterns ( Figure S1 ). Both the DEPs 1 of Model and Control groups and DEPs 2 of YQHYJD and Model groups were subjected to GO term enrichment analysis, which included Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function terms. There are 37 GO enrichment functions in common between DEPs 1 and DEPs 2 ( Figure 4 ). In addition, we also showed the unique top 20 GO enrichment functions of DEPs1 and DEPs2 in Figure S2 and Table S2 . The top 10 common GO terms were response to wounding, wound healing, regulation of proteolysis, regulation of endopeptidase activity, regulation of peptidase activity, import into cell, response to reactive oxygen species, endocytosis, response to vitamin, positive regulation of endocytosis. Enrichment analysis was also carried out for each set. Set 1 and Set 2 were enriched to few significant biological functions, which may be related to the small number of differential proteins. Set 3 showed that traditional Chinese medicine might be related to biological functions such as extract matrix, actin fixation, vascular membrane, platelet-derived growth factor binding, and so on. Set 4 showed that traditional Chinese medicine might play a role in nucleotide biosynthesis and metabolism, negative regulation of nervous system, cardiovascular system development and so on. The results suggest that Chinese medicine can play a certain therapeutic role by enhancing the curative effect (Table S3) . All DEPs were used for KEGG pathway analysis, pathways with -log(P-value) greater than 2 and gene proportion greater than 5% were screened out, the results show that there were 23 pathways, they are related to the immune system, endocrine system, digestive system, circulatory system, nervous system, Signal transduction, carbohydrate metabolism and transport and catabolism. The number of immune system related pathways and genes is the largest. The networks of KEGG pathway types, KEGG pathways and genes are constructed in Cytoscape ( Figure 5) . The specific pathways' P-value and gene proportion are shown in the Table S4 . The results of KEGG pathway analysis of each set showed that only a few meaningful pathways were obtained by Set 3, which were ECM receptor interaction, platelet activation, focal adhesion, cardiomyopathy, and so on (Table S3) . Based on proteomic analysis, Immune system related pathways were taken as the key research object. The PRM method was used to verify the targets involved in immune related pathways, and eight proteins obtained significant results. Hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck), phospholipid phosphatase 3 (Plpp3), myristoylated-alanine rich C-kinase substrate (Marcks) and Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 2 (Arpc2) down regulated in the Model group, alleviated in YQHYJD group ( Figure 6) . In KEGG pathways, these proteins belong to Fc gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis pathway ( Figure 5) , which suggests that in the model group, the phagocytosis of cells is inhibited, and YQHYJD could increase the phagocytosis of these cells and played the role of resistance to external microorganisms. In addition, the expression of collagen I (Col1a1) and Ras-related protein Rap1b decreased in the model group, which could be improved by YQHYJD ( S3), Col1a1 and Rap1b proteins belong to Platelet activation pathway In KEGG pathways ( Figure 5) , suggesting that YQHYJD may promote platelet activation, so as to improve the hypercoagulable state of blood in the lungs of animals with ARDS. The results of GTPase Hras and Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) are also significant ( Figure S3 ). They participated in IL-17 signaling pathway and chemokine signaling pathway. KEGG showed that both pathways could promote neutrophil migration, suggesting that YQHYJD may have an intervention effect in this respect. The TMT and PRM results of the eight target proteins verified were shown in Table S5 . Since the first description of ARDS in 1967, there has been little progress in developing novel therapies for ARDS. Currently, there are no effective therapeutic agents for preventing ARDS or alleviating its symptoms. Thus, the morbidity and mortality of patients with ARDS remain high (Boyle et al., 2013; Impellizzeri et al., 2015; Pham and Rubenfeld, 2017) . Recently, a consensusbased Berlin definition proposed to subdivide ARDS into three categories based on the degree of hypoxemia. Furthermore, it was suggested that the term ""acute lung injury"" should be dropped by the practitioners. In a recent international study, sepsis was reported to be a potential cause of ARDS in approximately 75% patients (59% pneumonia and 16% extrapulmonary sepsis) (Ranieri et al., 2012; Sweatt and Levitt, 2014; Bellani et al., 2016) . In the United States, sepsis is estimated to cause ARDS in more than 210,000 patients each year (Rubenfeld et al., 2005; US and World Population Clock and US and World Population Estimates, 2018) . The mortality of patients with ARDS induced by sepsis is higher than that induced by other factors (Stapleton et al., 2015) . In this study, an animal model of ARDS was generated by injecting LPS into the tail vein. The pathological features of the lung in this model were consistent with the characteristics of ARDS. ARDS occurs due to aberrant acute inflammation and dysfunction of endothelial and epithelial barriers of the lung and excessive transepithelial leukocyte migration. This results in the loss of alveolar capillary membrane integrity and the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines. The pathogenesis of ARDS involves the activation of both immune and structural cell types. The major immune cells involved in ARDS are neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and platelets (Fanelli et al., 2013; Butt et al., 2016; Confalonieri et al., 2017) . The pathogenesis of sepsis and ARDS is closely related to the aberrant activation of inflammatory responses, which play a key role in the development of ARDS (Wohlrab et al., 2015) . Previously, we had demonstrated that YQHYJD not only downregulates the expression of proinflammatory pathway proteins and proinflammatory factors but also increases the expression level of anti-inflammatory factors . This suggested that YQHYJD protects the lung tissue of ARDS rats by modulating the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. In this study, the lung tissue proteins of each experimental group were labeled with TMT. The proteins that are differentially expressed upon YQHYJD intervention were subjected to bioinformatics analysis. The following FIGURE 4 | It showed common GO terms. The size of the dot represents the number of gene proportion and the color represents the P-value. The yellower the color indicates the smaller the -log(P-value), and the redder the color indicates the larger the -log(P-value). proteins recovered after treatment with YQHYJD: Hck, Plpp3, Marcks, Arpc2, Col1a1, Rap1b, Hras, and Lcn2. In the KEGG pathway database, these proteins are related to phagocytosis, platelet activation and neutrophil migration. Similarly, the results of phagocytosis and platelet activation of these proteins were also reported. Studies have shown that Hck deficiency weakens the phagocytic function of microglia a b (Lim et al., 2020) . Hck is one of the key regulators of phagocytosis among the Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) in myeloid cells and combined absence of the Src family kinases Hck drastically impairs phagocytosis (Lim et al., 2018; Lorincz et al., 2019) . Drugs could inhibit Marcks expression, consequently, blocking Fc gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis pathway, which contributed to the cancer progression in vitro and in vivo . Study reveals that the Arpc2 is not a general requirement for phagocytosis or chemotaxis but is a critical driver of integrin-dependent processes (Rotty et al., 2017) . Rap1b was critical for platelet functions and was the main aggregation point of platelet signaling pathway, and played an important role in regulating platelet integrin activation during hemostasis (Dahiya and Atreya, 2020; Lagarrigue et al., 2020) . In this study, through TMT proteomics and PRM verification methods, it was clear that the protein of Hck, PPlpp3, Marcks and Arpc2 was significantly reduced in ARDS model, which indicated that the phagocytosis of cells in the lung of model animals was reduced. A multicenter clinical study has found that the phagocytosis dysfunction of alveolar macrophages in ARDS patients is related to the severity of the disease. In animal studies, enhancing the phagocytosis of alveolar macrophages and monocytes in vivo can reduce the degree of lung inflammation damage in model animals (Jackson et al., 2016; Du et al., 2019) . The decrease of neutrophil phagocytosis in Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with ARDS will also decrease the bacterial clearance rate and increase the pulmonary sepsis caused by ARDS (Griswold and Maier, 1988) . The results showed that YQHYJD could up regulate the expression of Hck and Arpc2, suggesting that YQHYJD might play an anti-microbial role by regulating the phagocytosis of cells, so as to reduce the inflammatory damage of lung tissue. A number of studies have shown that coagulation dysfunction is closely related to prognosis in patients with ARDS caused by antigens such as bacteria and viruses (Wu et al., 2020) . In critical patients, microthrombosis and thrombocytopenia coexist. The worsening thrombocytopenia is the most important laboratory sign suggesting progression of ARDS. In this situation, platelet transfusion might be tempting, but it is contraindicated FIGURE 5 | KEGG pathways network. The blue plots represent the DEPs, the pink plots represent the pathways, and the red plots represent the types of pathways. in endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease because platelet transfusion would further promote microthrombogenesis (Chang et al., 2019) . The produced platelet-neutrophil complexes participate in the defense mechanism by increasing phagocytosis capacity (Frantzeskaki et al., 2017) . In this study, YQHYJD can increase the expression of Col1a1 and Rap1b, which are involved in platelet activation. In summary, YQHYJD plays a role in reducing lung injury by participating in multiple immune related pathways such as Fc gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Further studies are needed to elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of YQHYJD for lung injury in vitro. Meanwhile, it is known that high mortality of ARDS has correlation with not only the damaged lung, but also the failure of extrapulmonary organs. YQHYJD can alleviate liver swelling and intestinal edema in rats with LPS-induce ARDS, which may be related to the multi-target and complementary mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine compound, which is worthy of further study in the future.

METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were administered with YQHYJD by oral gavage for 1 week. The rats were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce ARDS. The lung injury was assessed pathologically. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were screened by quantitative proteomics and analyzed using bioinformatic tools, such as Metascape and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) mapper. DEPs were verified by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). RESULTS: YQHYJD alleviated the LPS-induced pathological damage of lung tissue in rats. There were 134 DEPs among the YQHYJD treatment and model groups. The Genomes pathway analyses revealed that the DEPs were closely related to immune system pathway. The mass spectrometry analysis revealed that YQHYJD exhibits a protective effect on lung tissue by significantly upregulating hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck), phospholipid phosphatase 3 (Plpp3), myristoylated-alanine rich C-kinase substrate (Marcks), and Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 2 (Arpc2), which are related to Fc gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis pathway. CONCLUSION: YQHYJD can alleviate the lung injury of ARDS rats by regulating the Fc gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis pathway, which is related to immune system."
"Usually, experts are uncertain -their opinions or predictions are probabilistic-and may disagree in their judgments, even if they share a common interest with the regulator [10] . This raises the question: how should one pool their opinions? Probability aggregation is an important practical problem. With no evidence-based information on the Covid-19 disease, the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) developed an ad-hoc three-round voting method 4 to reach consensus [28] . When a potentially dangerous volcano becomes restless, civil authorities usually turn to scientists for help in anticipating risks. As the science of forecasting eruptions is not exact, volcanologists developed elaborate mathematical models to elicit and aggregate experts' probabilistic opinions [4, 11] . Methods that aggregate probabilities are now used in a huge number of applications such as estimating a nuclear risk, weather forecasting, calculating the risks to manned spaceflight due to collision with space debris, or the future of the polar bear population (see [2, 29] and chapter 15 in [12] ). 5 The Technical University of Delft has developed a software EXCALIBUR (acronym for EXpert CALIBRation). It is based on a method introduced in [12] which combines parametric and quantile inputs for continuous uncertain quantities from weighted experts. It then outputs a probability distribution (or equivalently a CDF). 6 Aggregating experts' uncertain opinions or probabilistic predictions is a well-studied mathematical/social choice problem [1, 31, 33, 12] , sometimes referred to as belief aggregation, or opinion pooling. The formal model is the following. Each expert i ∈ N is asked to provide his prior probability distribution p i ∈ P = ∆(Λ) over a set of outcomes Λ (usually finite or a real interval). The objective of the decision-maker (or the regulator) is to design a PAF = Probability Aggregation Function ψ : P N → P satisfying some desirable properties. Most of the literature described so far assumes honest reporting. In practice, judges may have strategic incentives that lead them to misreport their true beliefs. For example, the FDA uses advisory committees since the seventies and follow their recommendations 70% of the time. Each committee is composed ofusually-eleven experts, appointed for four years. Experts have to give individual answers to the FDA and their aggregate vote are used as a collective recommendation. There has been several controversies around conflict of interest in the advisory committees including kickbacks [30] . For example, the pharmaceutical companies GSK, Pfizer or Johnson and Johnson were recently charged several billion dollars for kickbacks. 7 Hence, it is important for the PAF to be incentive-compatible (reporting what you want the outcome to be is an optimal strategy). When monetary transfers are possible (e.g. the experts can be payed after the realization of the random variable they are predicting), the problem has been well studied since the fifties and several incentive compatible scoring rules have been developed [19, 24, 35, 14] . Our paper deals with situations where monetary transfers are not possible because the realization of the random variable is observed far in the future or the consequences of a mistake are catastrophic (infertility after vaccination, volcanic eruption, global warning). To the best of our knowledge, incentive compatible belief aggregation without monetary transfers has been studied only as a special case of single-peaked domain restrictions and only when Λ is finite. For strategyproofness to be stated formally, one needs assumptions about the individual preferences over the set P of probability distributions over Λ. If the voters' preferences are unrestricted, Gibbard [17] and Satterthwaite's [32] theorems apply and only a dictatorial method is strategyproof. Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite negative conclusion still holds even if one restricts the domain provided that it is ""rich"" enough (e.g. the class of all convex preferences [36] or the class of generalized single-peaked preferences, including all additively separable convex preferences [27] ). Fortunately, under a more severe restriction, the possibility of an anonymous aggregation has been proved recently [18, 16] in the domain of the L 1 -metric single-peaked preferences on P. 8 Goel et al. [18] proved the existence of a Pareto optimal strategyproof PAF and Freeman et al. [16] identified a large family of strategyproof PAF in the spirit of Moulin's characterization [26] . Suppose the outcome space Λ is a finitely ordered set {a m · · · a 2 a 1 }. To define experts' utility functions, we need to compute the cost for expert i if the aggregate probability p is different from its forecast p i . One natural way is by measuring the distance between the two using some L q -distance on P = ∆(Λ) ⊂ R m . For example, in [18, 16] they measure the cost in terms of the L 1 -distance. However, this distance is incoherent with the assumption that our alternatives are ordered. For example, imagine that p i (the peak of i) is the Dirac mass δ a1 at the smallest alternative a 1 and that p (the output) is the Dirac mass δ am at the highest alternative a m ∈ Λ. It is natural to assume that any other probability than p is better from the perspective of expert i, especially the Dirac mass at a 2 which is much closer to a 1 than a m . However no L q -distance on P = ∆(Λ) ⊂ R m will distinguish δ a1 − δ am Lq from δ a1 − δ a2 Lq as both are identical (equal to 2 1 q ). To capture the intuition that dist(δ a1 , δ am ) must be bigger than dist(δ a1 , δ a2 ), one needs to measure the distances in the space of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) C = Σ(Λ). This is what our paper will do. Our main contributions: -We suppose that the outcome space Λ is a Borel subset of R. For example, Λ can be the set of positive reals (stock market prices), the positive integers (number of infections), a compact interval (temperature in global warning) or a finite set (the Richter magnitude scale for earthquakes, the Volcanic explosivity index). -We define level-strategyproofness (level-SP) and prove that it implies incentive compatibility for a rich class of single-peaked preferences in the space of CDFs C. Namely if the designer uses a level-SP method 7 See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_pharmaceutical_settlements 8 Single-peaked preferences on ∆(Λ) with Λ finite under the L1-metric is a very small domain because every peak corresponds exactly to one preference ordering. then the optimal strategy of an expert will be to vote honestly as soon as his satisfaction is measured by some distance L q to the peak in the CDF space C (see section 2.3). -We prove several possibility theorems characterizing non-dictatorial level-SP aggregation mechanisms in combination or not with other desirable axioms (sections 3, 4 and 5). We also explore the boundaries of our characterizations by establishing several impossibility theorems (sections 2.4 and 5). -We characterize and compare two new practical solutions to the problem: middlemost-cumulative and proportional-cumulative (section 3). -We apply proportional-cumulative to extend some voting methods of electing and ranking by allowing experts to express their uncertainties about the quality of the candidates (section 6). The intuition behind level-SP is simple. Suppose the regulator decision depends on the likelihood of crossing a certain threshold, for example the probability of having a major natural hazard. Then, experts incentives will also depend on the probability of crossing that threshold. If the aggregation rule is level-SP, then whatever the threshold is, no expert, by misrepresenting his truly estimated probability distribution, can obtain that the probability of exceeding the given threshold is closer to what he wanted. 9 Our main possibility result proves that a probability aggregation function ψ : P N → P, or equivalently its associated cumulative aggregation function Ψ : C N → C, is level-SP iff there is a family of simple voting rules {g a : [0, 1] n → [0, 1]} a∈Λ such that each g a is one-dimensional strategyproof a la Moulin [26] and the CDF P = Ψ (P 1 , . . . , P n ) of society at any level a ∈ Λ is computed as P (a) = g a (P 1 (a), . . . , P n (a)). When we combine this result with the Moulin's formulae [26] we obtain explicit characterizations of level-SP PAF in which the phantoms in Moulin [26] are replaced with monotone right continuous functions. In addition to level-SP, a natural axiom to satisfy is certainty preservation. It says that if all experts agree that some event must happen almost surely or can't happen almost surely, then the aggregation preserves that property. 10 This axiom is classical and is called the zero preservation property in [33] or consensus preservation in [15] . With level-SP, they imply a form of independence (another classical axiom) but on the CDF space, e.g. g a = g for every a ∈ Λ. If in addition, the designer wants to satisfy the plausibility preservation axiom 11 then the simple voting rule g associated to Ψ must output one of its inputs. Middlemostcumulative, (our first main method) is probably the most salient in this class. Its main drawback is its lack of diversity as whenever experts inputs dominate one another, the output is the median expert's input. Our second main method (proportional-cumulative) will be more diversified as it will be the unique level-SP probability aggregation function satisfying a proportionality axiom (which says that if all inputs are the Dirac distributions {δ ai } i=1,...,n , then the output is the average 1 n n i=1 δ ai ). As application, a recent voting method -majority judgment [5] -is extended to electing and ranking problems where the experts are uncertain about the quality of the alternatives/candidates. For example, in the context of a political election, an expert may think for sure that candidate A will be Good and believe that B may be a Great candidate with probability 1 2 and a Terrible candidate with probability 1 2 . In the context of Brexit, an expert may think that quitting the EU will benefit the UK with probability 3 4 and will harm the UK with probability 1 4 . The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model, the new notion of level-strategyproofness, and its implications together with a quick summary of the fundamental results of Moulin [26] . Section 3 introduces our two main anonymous level-SP methods together with their axiomatic characterizations. Section 4 goes more into details and summarizes all the intermediary characterizations in the anonymous case. Section 5 extends sections 3 and 4 results to the non-anonymous case and explores the boundaries of our characterizations by establishing several impossibilities. Section 6 applies proportional-cumulative to extend majority rule, approval voting and majority judgment voting methods for electing and ranking to situations where experts can express their uncertainties. Section 7 concludes. The appendix contains all the proofs.@story_separate@We first recall the classical characterizations of strategyproof aggregation rules when voters have onedimensional single-peaked preferences (Moulin [26]). Then we describe our probability aggregation model, we introduce the notion of level-strategyproofness (level-SP) and prove it to imply honest reporting for a rich family of single-peaked preferences over the CDF space C. Finally, we show that for an ordered set of outcomes, level-SP is more natural than and incompatible with the classical strategyproof notions, defined with respect to single-peaked preferences over the space of probability distributions. In the sequel, N = {1, . . . , n} denotes the set of voters or experts, and n their number. For any set Z, we will use the following notations, z = (z 1 , . . . , z n ) ∈ Z N and z −i (z i ) to denote the profile which differs from z only in dimension i which is replaced by z i . We recall Moulin's results [26] and characterizations as they are central to describe our results. Definition 1 (Single-peaked preference). A preference order T (represented with ) over the set of The value x is known as the peak. Definition 2 (Single-dimensional strategyproofness: one-SP). A voting rule g : [0, 1] N → [0, 1] is one-SP iff whenever all experts have single-peaked preferences and all are expected to submit their peaks to be aggregated by g, no expert can obtain a strictly better alternative by reporting a fake peak. Remark 1. It can be proved that the previous definition is equivalent to the following property called uncompromisingness in [8] : a voting rule g is one-SP iff for all experts i ∈ N and for all peak profiles r ∈ [0, 1] N : and r i > g(r) ⇒ g(r) ≥ g(r −i (r i )). We may be interested in rules such that whenever all experts agree on a peak, society chooses that peak. This axiom is usually called unanimity. We will formulate it for a general input space X as it is needed later. Theorem 1 (Moulin general). A voting rule g : [0, 1] N → [0, 1] is one-SP iff for each coalition of players S ∈ 2 N , there exists a unique ""phantom"" value β S ∈ [0, 1] such that: S ⊆ S implies β S ≤ β S and ∀r = (r 1 , . . . , r n ) ∈ [0, 1] N , g(r) = sup S⊆N min (β S , min i∈S r i ). Moreover the method is unanimous iff β ∅ = 0 and β N = 1. Moulin's formulae is more popular in the anonymous case where experts are treated equally by the rule. Axiom 2 (Anonymity) h : X N → X is anonymous if ∀x ∈ X N and all permutations σ over N : Theorem 2 (Moulin anonymous). The voting rule g : [0, 1] N → [0, 1] is one-SP and anonymous iff there exist n + 1 ""phantom voters"" α 1 ≤ · · · ≤ α n+1 in [0, 1] such that: ∀r = (r 1 , . . . , r n ) ∈ [0, 1] N ∈ [0, 1] N , g(r) = median(r 1 , . . . , r n , α 1 , . . . , α n+1 ). Moreover, the method is unanimous if and only if α 1 = 0 and α n+1 = 1. In Jennings et al [21] several equivalent formulae are established, both in the anonymous and the general case. One of the characterizations simplifies the Moulin maxmin formula above by expressing it in a manner resembling the anonymous case. Expressing it as the median of the inputs after determining n + 1 phantom values that are appropriate considering the input. Thus, the new characterizations in [21] can be used, instead of Moulin's formula, to obtain alternative representations of level-SP probability aggregation functions. It is now time to describe our model. Society (or a decision-maker, or the regulator) wants to estimate a random variable X that ranges over a linearly ordered set of outcomes Λ that we identify with a Borel measurable subset of the real line R. In practice, think of Λ as a finite subset or an interval of R. To construct the estimation, several experts i ∈ N = {1, . . . , n} are asked to submit their (subjective) probability distribution estimation p i ∈ P where P denotes the set of Borel probability distributions over Λ. Our objective is to design a Probability Aggregation Function (PAF) ψ : P N → P which is used to determine society's estimation. As some experts may be strategically behaving, we wish ψ to be incentive compatible. Our paper focuses on problems where society's final decision is based on a threshold, that is to say, the event of outcomes that are below (or above) a certain level. In practice, situations that are represented with tipping points (e.g. climate change, the degree of a volcanic eruption damaging impact) are level-events. Definition 3 (Level Events). We define for any outcome a ∈ Λ, the level event E(a) as ""the threshold a has not been crossed"", e.g. The following definition says that a PAF is incentive compatible with respect to level events if, no matter the threshold a ∈ Λ is, no expert can by misreporting obtain that society's probability for the level event E(a) is closer to the one he/she wishes. Hence, as far as the outcome of the aggregation will be used to make a decision based on the probability of crossing a given threshold, this definition properly describes what it means to be incentive compatible in this context. Axiom 3 (Level-SP) A PAF ψ : P N → P is level-strategyproof 12 if for any expert ∀i ∈ N , any input profile p ∈ P N , any potential deviation p i ∈ P of expert i and any threshold a ∈ Λ: and p i (E(a)) > ψ(p)(E(a)) ⇒ ψ(p)(E(a)) ≥ ψ(p −i (p i ))(E(a)). Consequently with this axiom satisfied, if society's final decision (or policy) depends on a level event and expert utility depends on society's final decision then it is a dominant strategy for every expert to vote honestly. Formulated differently, let C be the set of cumulative distribution functions (CDF) over Λ. Let π : P → C be the mapping that transforms a probability distribution p over Λ into its CDF P : ∀p ∈ P, ∀a ∈ Λ, P (a) = π(p)(a) = p(E(a)) = x≤a dp(x). To a PAF ψ : P N → P is associated a unique cumulative aggregation function (CAF) Ψ : C N → C that takes the CDFs {P i = π(p i )} i∈N of experts as inputs and returns the CDF of ψ(p) as its output, that is, Ψ (π(p 1 ), . . . , π(p n )) = π(ψ(p 1 , . . . , p n )). With this notation, saying that the PAF ψ : P N → P is level-SP is equivalent to saying that the associated CAF Ψ : C N → C satisfies: for every a ∈ Λ, every P ∈ C N , P' ∈ C N and all i ∈ N : P i (a) < Ψ (P)(a) ⇒ Ψ (P)(a) ≤ Ψ (P −i (P i ))(a) 12 As our characterizations in next sections show, level-SP methods remain incentive compatible if level sets are defined by strict {X < a} or reverse {X ≥ a}, {X > a} inequalities. and P i (a) > Ψ (P)(a) ⇒ Ψ (P )(a) ≥ Ψ (P −i (P i ))(a). this implies that for every a ∈ Λ, every P ∈ C N , P' ∈ C N and all i ∈ N : In the following we will show that this definition of incentive compatibility implies a form of robustness with respect to details modeling, that is, level-SP implies the optimality of honest reporting with respect to a large class of single-peaked preferences on the CDF space C, in particular the L 1 -distance. This will also allow us to compare our notion with the existing strategyproof concepts in the literature (see the next subsection). p 1 , . . . , p n ψ(p 1 , . . . , p n ) For each probability measure ν on Λ absolutely continuous w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure and each positive real r ∈ R + , we can define an L r -distance on C as follows. P − Q Lr = [ Λ |P (a) − Q(a)| r dν(a)] 1/r , then, if ψ verifies level-SP, it also satisfies, ∀i ∈ N , ∀P ∈ C N any ∀P i ∈ C: Where the inequality follows from (1) . Consequently, if the utility of expert i is measured by the use a distance L r on C to its peak, e.g.: u i (p) = − π(ψ(p)) − π(p i ) Lr = − Ψ (P) − P i Lr and if level-SP is satisfied, then we obtain L r (C)-strategyproofness for every r, e.g. it is an optimal strategy for an expert to vote honestly as soon as his utility function is measured with some L r (C) distance to the peak. An alternative natural way to model the utility of an expert i would be to measure the distance to the peak in the probability space P, e.g.: Call a method L r (P)-SP if honesty is the optimal strategy of an expert with the utility function v i above. In the special case where Λ = {a 1 , . . . , a m } is finite, ν is the uniform distribution and r = 1, we obtain the model and strategyproofness concept studied in the budget aggregation problem [16] . The moving phantom mechanisms they defined are proved to be L 1 (P)-SP. They are not level-SP. In fact, L 1 (P)-SP and level-SP are incompatible as the following shows. Theorem 3 (Impossibility 1). When #Λ ≥ 4, n ≥ 3 and the mechanism is certainty preserving 13 , level-SP and L 1 (P)-SP are incompatible unless there is a dictator. The question now is, which assumption is more meaningful when outcomes are ordered? Single-peakedness in the probability space P (as it is usually assumed in the literature) or single-peakedness in the CFD space C (as we assume)? Suppose Λ = {a 1 , . . . , a m } and some expert is single-minded and submit a Dirac mass at a ∈ Λ and that society's aggregation is a Dirac mass at b = a then, intuitively, the expert wants b to be as close to a as possible. But, if utilities are measured using some L r -distance on the probability space P, then the fact that the value of δ a − δ b Lr is independent of a and b is not intuitive. In contrast, when utilities are measured with any L r -distance on the CDF space C (as in the previous subsection), then the fact that the utility of the expert strictly increases as b goes to a is more intuitive. To conclude, in a probability aggregation problem where the outcomes are completely independent of one another and there is no underlying alignment or a closeness relation between the outcomes, having a neutral distance (such as the L 1 (P)) makes complete sense and, in that case, the aggregation problem is somehow solved: we have the existence of interesting strategyproof voting rules in the single-peaked domain induced by the L 1 (P)-distance as proved in [16] (the moving phantom mechanisms) 14 and we also know that the dictatorial rules are the only strategyproof PAF whenever we slightly enlarge the domain of single-peaked preferences [36, 27] . However, when the space of outcomes Λ has a linear structure as in our article, measuring distances in the CDF space is not only natural but also allow the existence of interesting voting rules that are incentive compatible for all L r (C) single-peaked preferences, r ∈]0, ∞]. This property is hard to obtain in the probability space even with ordered outcomes. For example the phantom moving mechanisms in [16] are no longer strategyproof if one replaces the distance L 1 (P) by L 2 (P). In this section and the rest of the paper, we will interchangeably use the probability input votes {p i } i∈N or the CDF input votes {P i = π(p i )} i∈N , depending if we want to establish a property on the PAF ψ : P N → P or its CAF Ψ := π • ψ : C N → C. We will abuse notations: when ψ is level-SP, we will also call its corresponding CAF Ψ level-SP. 15  Definition 4 (Order-functions). The order-function g k : [0, 1] N → [0, 1], k ∈ {1, . . . , n} is the voting rule that for a set of n values in [0, 1] return the k th smallest value. As such g 1 (r 1 , . . . , r n ) = min(r 1 , . . . , r n ), g n (r 1 , . . . , r n ) = max(r 1 , . . . , r n ) and when n is odd g (n+1)/2 (r 1 , . . . , r n ) = median(r 1 , . . . , r n ) It is well known and easy to show that the order-functions are one-SP [26, 5] . This class plays an important role in majority judgment theory where it has been characterized axiomatically in various ways [5] . Definition 5 (Order-cumulatives). We denote as the k th order-cumulative Ψ k : C N → C the CAF which is defined by applying the k th order function at each level a ∈ Λ in the CDF space: ∀a ∈ Λ, Ψ k (P)(a) := g k (P 1 (a), . . . , P n (a)). We let ψ k denote the associated probability aggregation function that will also be called an order-cumulative. 13 The certainty preservation axiom is defined in the next section. It says that whenever all experts believe that some event is certain to happen almost surely, so does society. 14 It remains an open problem [16] whether the phantom moving mechanisms are the only anonymous continuous L1(P)-SP mechanisms. 15 One may wonder why we didn't choose to avoid having two notations and just define one model: the aggregation of cumulative distributions problem. The first reason is: except for the level-SP axiom, all the other important axioms are stated on the probability space: certainty preservation, plausibility preservation, or proportionality. The second reason is: level-SP and all the characterizations are better understood on the CDF space. Consider a safe-to-dangerous scale Λ such as the Richter magnitude scale for earthquakes, the Volcanic explosivity index, or the hurricanes intensity scale. The min order-cumulative Ψ 1 is the most cautious response: since for each threshold, we consider the opinion of the most worried expert. On the other hand, the max order-cumulative Ψ n is the less paranoid response as its output dominates all experts' CDFs. The middlemost-cumulative method represents the ""median"" position. The order-cumulatives are the simplest level-SP methods. They are axiomatically characterized as follows. Theorem 4 (Order-cumulatives characterization). The order-cumulatives are the unique level-SP probability aggregation mechanisms that are anonymous, certainty preserving, and plausibility preserving. Certainty and plausibility preservation will be formally defined in the next section. Certainty preservation says that if all experts are certain that some Borel measurable event will occur almost surely, so does society. Plausibility preservation says that when an interval has a positive probability for all experts, so does society. 16 We are particularly interested in the middlemost-cumulative. That is to say, the order-cumulative defined by the median order-function when n is odd and when n is even, we have two middlemost-cumulatives: the lower Ψ n 2 and the upper Ψ n 2 +1 . It is easy to show that middlemost-cumulatives are welfare maximizers if experts' utilities are measured using the L 1 (C) distance to the peak. If there are three experts where two of them believe that a 1 ∈ Λ will occur for sure and the last one believes that a 2 will occur for sure, then any order-cumulative will output one of two Diracs. However, if the experts are equally competent, the ""fair"" aggregation seems to be 2/3δ a1 + 1/3δ a2 . Such diversity in the output is desirable as it means that all opinions are represented in the aggregation. If experts are single-minded (every vote p i is equal to a Dirac mass at a i ∈ Λ, e.g. p i = δ ai , ∀i ∈ N ), the aggregation must coincide with the average probability distribution: ∀(a 1 , . . . , a n ) ∈ Λ N ψ(δ a1 , . . . , δ an ) = 1 n i∈N δ ai . It is straightforward that the kth-order-cumulative does not verify proportionality as it returns the kthopinion δ a (k) after re-ordering the inputs a (1) ≤ · · · ≤ a (k) ≤ · · · ≤ a (n) . Observe that the mean probability aggregation function ψ(p 1 , . . . , p n ) := 1 n i∈N p i satisfies proportionality, but it is not level-SP. Surprisingly, there is a unique level-SP proportional method, described now. Definition 6. The proportional-cumulative Ψ : C N → C is the aggregation method defined as follows: ∀P = (P 1 , . . . , P n ), ∀a ∈ Λ, Ψ (P)(a) = median P 1 (a), . . . , P n (a), 1 n , 2 n , . . . , n − 1 n In the Moulin's model, the one-SP method µ : is known as the uniform median or linear median. It has been introduced independently by [9] and [22] and it was inspiring in the definition of a proportional moving phantom mechanism called IMM in [16] . Theorem 5 ( Proportional-cumulative characterization). The proportional-cumulative is the unique level-SP probability aggregation function that verifies the proportionality axiom. Pi(x) Fig. 1 : P 1 , P 2 and P 3 are the three cumulative functions of three voters. They stochastically dominate one another: P 1 is more biased to the left, P 3 more to the right. The middlemost-cumulative (in green) coincide with the input of the middlemost voter P 3 . Pi(x) The proportional-cumulative (in green) follows at its left the leftist voter P 1 for one third of the mass, follows at its right the rightist voter P 3 for one third of the mass, and similarly for the middle.  The main drawback of middlemost-cumulative is its lack of diversity. When the various supports S i of the experts' subjective probabilities p i are disjoint intervals I i , or more generally, when the P i 's first-order stochastically dominates one another (as in Fig 1) , the outcome of middlemost-cumulative equals the view of the median-expert (see the green curve in Figure 1 (CDFs) and Figure 3 (densities)). On the contrary, proportional-cumulative takes into account all the experts' views and in a natural way. As Figure 2 shows, the leftmost expert CDF is followed at first by proportional-cumulative for one-third of the probability mass. This is a good property since the fact he is the leftmost expert means that the first third of his probability distribution is what best describes how he differs from the other experts and therefore what he most likely wants to emphasize. Similarly, the rightmost expert is followed by proportional-cumulative for his rightmost third of his opinion, which also best represents how his opinion differs from the group and so what he most likely wants to emphasize. The middle expert is followed for his middle opinion which again is interesting for the same reason. As such, not only do experts contribute for exactly one n-th of the final outcome but proportional-cumulative ensures that the most sticking aspects of their opinion (compared to the group) are conserved. Given that the order-cumulatives are the unique anonymous level-SP probability aggregation functions that satisfy certainty preservation and plausibility preservation, proportional-cumulative must violate one of the axioms. It is clearly anonymous and is certainty preserving (see next section). Hence, it violates plausibility preservation. That can be seen in Figure 4 : the density of proportional-cumulative (in green) for the interval [1, 2] is zero while the experts' densities for this interval are all strictly positive. We believe that the violation of this axiom is not so problematic because proportional-cumulative satisfies a weak version of plausibility: if a level event has a positive probability for all experts, so does society. If the decision-maker's final decision is only based on a level-event, only the plausibility of such an event is of importance. This section details several characterizations in the anonymous case, the general case is discussed in the next section. We start by identifying all anonymous level-SP methods then we refine this set by adding two classical axioms (certainty and plausibility preservations) until only the order-cumulatives remain. In the appendix is proved that level-SP implies that for every a ∈ Λ and every input profile P = (P 1 , . . . , P n ), the value of society's CDF Ψ (P 1 , . . . , P n )(a) := g a at a depends only on the experts CDF values (P(a)) ∈ [0, 1] N in a. This will imply (appendix) that for every a, g a : [0, 1] N → [0, 1] is one-SP as defined in section 2.1. If in addition we require anonymity (see Axiom 1) then from Moulin's anonymous characterization, we deduce the following result. 17 Theorem 6 (Anonymous level-SP characterization). A PAF ψ : P N → P is level-SP and anonymous if and only if there exist n + 1 phantom functions f 1 ≤ · · · ≤ f n+1 each from Λ → [0, 1] increasing and right continuous such that Ψ : C N → C the CAF associated to ψ verifies the formulae: where lim a→sup Λ f n+1 (a) = 1. Moreover ψ is unanimous if and only if f 1 = 0 and f n+1 = 1. In the sequel, we will call the {f k } k∈{1,...,n+1} in the theorem above the phantom functions associated to ψ. Example of figure 5 corresponds to an anonymous and unanimous PAF (in green on the right side). This PAF does not verify either of the desirable axioms defined in the next two subsections. 17 Recall that anonymity is defined in Axiom 1 and Unanimity in Axiom 2. Pi(x) On the left is drawn the cumulative functions P 1 , P 2 and P 3 of our 3 voters. In black, is drawn the phantom functions F 2 and F 3 (F 1 = 0 and F 4 = 1 are not drawn). On the right, for each level x in the x-axe, the outcome in green is median( It is natural to wish that when all experts agree that an event is certain to happen almost surely (or certain not to happen) then the aggregation of their probabilities reflects that too. Axiom 5 (Certainty preservation) A PAF ψ preserves certainty iff for any probability profiles p = (p 1 , . . . , p n ) and all events A ⊆ Λ Borel measurable: In other words, if an event is judged impossible (resp. certain) almost surely by all experts then it is judged impossible (resp. certain) almost surely by the aggregation function. This is a fairly standard axiom in the literature sometimes called the zero preservation property or [33] or consensus preservation in [15] . Magically, this property alone suffices to imply unanimity and that the phantom functions a → f k (a) are constant in a (see the appendix). Combining with the previous theorem, we obtain the following. Theorem 7 (Certainty preservation characterization (Anonymous)). A PAF ψ : P N → P is level-SP, anonymous and certainty preserving if and only if there are n − 1 phantom values f 2 ≤ · · · ≤ f n ∈ [0, 1] such that such that Ψ : C N → C the CAF associated to ψ verifies the following: The one-SP anonymous function g(r 1 , . . . , r n ) = median(r 1 , . . . , r n , f 2 , . . . , f n ) : [0, 1] N → [0, 1] that will be called in the sequel the one-SP rule associated to ψ or Ψ . It is interesting to note that proportionalcumulative and the order-cumulatives are, from their definition, certainty preserving. We now wish to capture the property according to which: if all experts agree that an outcome may happen with positive probability then the PAF preserves that property. Axiom 6 (Plausibility preservation) A PAF ψ : P N → P verifies plausibility preservation iff for any input profiles p ∈ P N and any possible interval I ⊆ Λ: The next theorem says that the condition for plausibility preservation is that some monotony property must be satisfied by the phantom functions in all intervals where their values are not 0 or 1. Theorem 8 (Plausibility preservation characterization (Anonymous)). A PAF ψ : P N → P is level-SP, plausibility preserving and anonymous iff each phantom function f k is strictly increasing on the interval where its value is not in {0, 1} and f 1 (a) < 1 for any a < sup Λ and f n+1 (a) > 0 for any a > inf Λ. Figure 6 represents a mechanism which is unanimous (F 1 = 0, F 4 = 1), anonymous, certainty preserving (phantoms F 2 and F 3 are constant) which is not plausibility preservation (F 2 and F 3 are never equal to 0 or 1 but not strictly increasing). Figure 7 represents a mechanism which is unanimous (F 1 = 0, F 4 = 1), anonymous, plausibility preserving (the phantom functions which are not 0 and 1, F 2 and F 3 , are strictly increasing) but is not certainty preserving as the phantoms F 2 and F 3 are not constants. Remark 3. In theorem 4 of section 3, we stated without proof that the unique PAFs that are anonymous, certainty preserving, and plausibility preserving are the order-cumulatives. The proof follows easily from the last theorems. Certainty preservation implies that all the phantoms functions are constants and from plausibility preservation that they must all be equal to 0 or to 1. Hence g, the one-SP associated to ψ, must be an order-function. As proportional-cumulative is anonymous and certainty preserving, it violates plausibility preservation (as illustrated in figure 4) . However, it satisfies the following weaker version. Axiom 7 (Level plausibility preservation) A PAF ψ : P N → P verifies level plausibility preservation iff for any input profiles p ∈ P N and any level event E: If a level-SP PAF is unanimous, it is level plausibility preserving. As certainty preserving level-SP methods (such as proportional-cumulative) are unanimous, they are level plausibility preserving. In the next section, we explore the world of non necessarily anonymous PAFs, because, in practice, experts are not equally qualified and are usually weighted by the aggregation method. While interesting and more intuitive, the anonymous methods cannot be applied when experts do not have equal expertise. This section characterizes the level-SP methods that are not necessarily anonymous. Thanks to Moulin's maxmin formulae, we can obtain characterizations similar in spirit to the anonymous case. We are also going to explore the limits of our axiomatizations by establishing several impossibilities. As in the anonymous case, level-SP implies that we should replace the phantoms in Moulin's characterization in theorem 1 by phantoms functions. As in the anonymous case, we will call the {a → f S (a)} S∈2 N in the theorem above the phantom functions associated to ψ. The next theorem says that certainty preservation implies level-independence. Where Ψ is the CDF associated to ψ. As in the anonymous case, we will refer to g as the one-SP voting rule associated to ψ (or equivalently Ψ ). Theorem 10 (Certainty preservation characterization). A level-SP PAF ψ : P N → P is certainty preserving if and only it is: unanimous and level independent. unanimous and its associated phantom functions {a → f S (a)} S∈2 N are constants in a. It is unsurprising that certainty preservation implies unanimity since both notions model the idea that if all experts agree on something then the outcome should reflect that agreement. Let us now explore the boundaries of our result. Level-independence is a weak version of a classical axiom in the literature called independence. Unfortunately, independence is known to be a very strong axiom as, alone, it implies that ψ must be a weighted average of the expert's inputs [34, 25, 7, 13, 15] , which is not level-strategyproof unless it is dictatorial. Theorem 11 (Impossibility 2). The unique level-SP and independent PAFs are the dictatorials. Again, the characterization of plausibility preserving PAFs is essentially the same as in the anonymous case. Theorem 12 (Plausibility preservation characterization). A PAF ψ : P N → P is level-SP and plausibility preserving if and only if any associated phantom function f S is strictly increasing on the interval where its value is not in {0, 1} and f ∅ (a) < 1 for any a < sup Λ and f N (a) > 0 for any a > inf Λ. The definition of certainty preservation uses Borel set while the definition of plausibility preservation uses intervals. One might ask what happens if we replace intervals with Borel sets? Axiom 10 (Borel plausibility preservation) A PAF ψ : P N → P satisfies Borel plausibility preservation iff for any input profiles p ∈ P N and any Borel A ⊂ Λ: Borel plausibility preservation is too strong as it results in an impossibility result. Theorem 13 (Impossibility 3). When Λ = Z, or is a real interval, the unique PAFs that are levels-SP, unanimous, and Borel plausibility preserving are the dictatorials. Other impossibilities are proved in the appendix. In the anonymous case combining certainty preservation, and plausibility preservation characterized the order-cumulatives. It is therefore interesting to explore their association without the anonymity axiom. Hence there is a finite number of methods that are level-SP, certainty preserving, and plausibility preserving. Just like with the anonymous case, they all have the property that if the inputs dominate one another, the output is equals to one of the inputs (as in figure 3 ). Elegantly, this property fully characterizes this class. Theorem 15 (Certainty and plausibility Characterization 2). A PAF ψ : P N → P is level-SP, certainty preserving and plausibility preserving iff whenever the inputs dominate one another (there is a permutation σ such that P σ(1) ≤ · · · ≤ P σ(n) ) the output is on of the inputs. The next section presents a more diverse level-SP method. This subsection extends proportional-cumulative to problems where experts are not equally competent and have non equal weights. To fully characterize this method, we extend the definition of the proportionality axiom. To motivate this new axiom, imagine a situation where experts have extreme views. In that case, we want the aggregation method to output a diversified solution that takes into account all the views weighted by the expert's degree of expertise. For example, suppose we have two experts, the first represents 95% of the scientific community view and believes global temperature will surely raise by exactly 0.2 • C in the next decade. The second represents the remaining 5% of the community and believes that global temperature won't change. A fair compromising PAF would consider the final probability to be a 5% chance that the climate won't change and a 95% chance that it will rise by 0.2 • C. The next axiom formalizes this idea. Axiom 11 (Weighted proportionality) If experts are single-minded (every vote p i is equal to the Dirac mass at some a i ∈ Λ, e.g. p i = δ ai , ∀i ∈ N ), the aggregation must coincide with the weighted average: ∀(a 1 , . . . , a n ) ∈ Λ N ψ(δ a1 , . . . , δ an ) = i w i δ ai ; where w i ≥ 0 is the normalized weight attributed to expert i ∈ N , with j∈N w j = 1. In practice, there is a whole science, regulations, and procedures of how to attribute weights to experts [12] . If the aggregation problem is recurrent and the realized outcome observable (anticipating a volcanic irruption, or predicting the price of an asset or the growth rate), one way to fix weights is by using some nonregret reinforcement-learning algorithm where experts are scored at every time period depending on their realized performance and the weights are changed dynamically proportionally to the accumulated scores [20, 12] . The weighted average ψ(p 1 , . . . , p n ) = i w i p i satisfies that axiom but it is not level-strategyproof unless w i = 0 for exactly one expert (the dictator). The next theorem shows that there is exactly one PAF function satisfying level-SP and weighted proportionality. This function happens to be certainty preserving and so can be uniquely described by its one-SP voting rule µ w : [0, 1] Theorem 16 (Weighted proportional-cumulative characterization). The unique PAF ψ : P n → P that verifies level-SP and weighted proportionality is the unique certainty preserving one associated to the one-SP rule µ w , that is: ∀a ∈ Λ, (P 1 , . . . , P n ) ∈ C; Ψ (P 1 , . . . , P n )(a) := µ w (P 1 (a), . . . , P n (a)) One of the most interesting aspects of the weighted proportional-cumulative is how it responds to dominated inputs. The next theorem shows that, just like what we have seen in the examples with proportionalcumulative, the experts will contribute in the aggregation for exactly their weights and the weightedcumulative will follow the probability distribution of an expert on the segment that best describes its role in the group. For example, the leftmost expert contributes on his leftmost segment, in other words, exactly the interval where he disagrees most with the other experts. Proposition 2 (Proportional-cumulative for dominated opinion). Suppose that Λ is an interval, and that all the P i are continuous and verify for all i ∈ N , P i ≥ P i+1 . Then the weighted-proportional level-SP mechanism ψ : P N → P of weight w can be computed for this input profile as follows: Example in Figure 2 is an illustration of the theorem above. The following table resumes all our characterizations.  The objective of this section is to show that proportional-cumulative could be combined with a recent evaluation-based voting method (Majority Judgment [5, 6] , MJ) to construct a strategically robust voting method in situations where voters have uncertainties and doubts about the candidates. To elect one candidate/alternative or rank several [3] , existing voting methods (plurality, Borda, Condorcet, approval voting, etc) implicitly assume that individual voters are certain about their opinions or views. In practice, voters are mostly uncertain. In recruitment committees, members are often hesitating between a good safe candidate vs a risky one. On the day of the Brexit vote, no voter knew with certainty what the final deal between the UK and the EU would be, nor did they know the long-term consequences of such a deal. Similarly, when a reviewer is judging a paper for a conference, they are often uncertain about the quality of some of the papers. To capture those uncertainties, one can use an extension of majority judgment. Let us first describe how majority judgment (MJ) works for a small number of voters. Suppose we have a numerical scale {0, . . . , 9} and a set of grades ordered from best to worse A = (9, 7, 6, 5, 2) corresponding to the grades given by 5 voters to candidate A. Its majority value is obtained by iterating from the middlemost grade (the median), then down, up, down etc, which gives us the 5 dimensional vector v(A) = (6, 5, 7, 2, 9) . Two ordered set of grades A and B are compared in lexicographic order by their majority values. For example if B = (9, 8, 6, 4, 1) then v(B) = (6, 4, 8, 1, 9) and so v(A) > v(B) because (6, 5, 7, 2, 9) (6, 4, 8, 1, 9) . Majority judgment is an ordinal method as the ranking remains unchanged if the numerical grades are replaced by some qualitative set of grades such as {Great, Good, Average, Poor, Terrible}. Also, the MJ ranking can be extended to a continuum of voters (e.g. a normalized distribution over the set of grades, see [5] chapter 14). Fig. 10 : In majority judgment [6, 5] , each voter is asked to grade each candidate on a scale Λ such as ""Great, Good, Average, Poor, Terrible"". The output for each candidate (the merit profile) can be interpreted as a probability distribution over Λ. The winner is the one with the highest median grade (the majority-grade). In case of the same majority-grade, an elaborate iterative rule breaks the tie (see the main text for an example). In the surveys above, Donald Trump's majority grade is ""Poor"" in both elections and so with majority judgment he loses against both competitors, Clinton and Biden, since their majority grade is ""Average"". : each voter i ∈ N is asked to submit for each candidate A ∈ A a probability distribution p A i ∈ P = ∆(Λ). For example, the voter may think that A k will be Good for sure, and that A l will be Great with probability 2 3 and Terrible with probability 1 3 . -Output for voters: each candidate A is given an aggregate probability distribution p A computed using the weighted-proportional-cumulative that is P A (a) = µ w (P A  1 (a) , . . . , P A N (a)). -Ranking of the alternatives: classical majority judgment is applied to rank the distributions p A1 , p A2 ,. . . , p A M and consequently the candidates/alternatives in A. Main properties of MJU: -IIA: adding or dropping a candidate does not change the ranking between the others. This is because MJ is transitive and the ranking between two candidates A and B by MJU depends only on their respective distributions p A and p B , which are only a function of the inputs regarding them. -Impartiality: candidates are treated equally by the method. This is because MJ is impartial and MJU applies the same PAF (the weighted-proportional-cumulative) to compute each candidate's A distribution p A . If we want the method to be anonymous (voters are treated equally) just set w 1 = · · · = w N = 1 N . -Extends MJ : if all voters are certain about their choices (i.e. their input are Dirac measures) and have equal weights (anonymity), MJU outputs the empirical distribution of inputs for each candidate, and so the ranking of MJU coincides with the ranking of MJ. Note that proportional-cumulative is the only level-SP method that induces an extension of MJ. -Resistance to strategic manipulations: This is a direct consequence of combining proportional-cumulative (level-strategyproof) and majority judgment (designed to counter strategic manipulations). The philosophy behind MJ was to allow voters to better express themselves (compared to plurality let say) by submitting a grade on a scale Λ for each candidate. MJU goes further in this philosophy by allowing voters to express their uncertainties about the candidates on the same scale. This can in principle be done without difficulty if the judges are experts (university professors in a recruitment committee), but the task is probably impossible in large elections and some approximation is necessary. For example, one could ask the voters to check, for each candidate, several grades which are then converted to a uniform distribution over the subset of checked grades. What about the extension of other voting methods to uncertainty? Arrowian voting methods [3] based on ranking-orderings -e.g. voters are asked their full preference ordering over all the candidates (Borda, STV)cannot easily be extended to uncertainty, at least in a practical way. A possible extension is to submit a probability over the set of permutations over A, e.g. with probability 1 2 the ranking is A > B > C > D and the probability 1 2 it is C > B > A > D? theoretically, this can be done and several known methods can be consistently extended to uncertainty. In practice, it seems a very difficult task for voters as the interpretation is not clear -how a voter who is uncertain about a few candidates vote?-. Other methods can be extended. For example, consider binary decision problems such as a referendum (e.g. the Brexit), and extend majority rule -with the Condorcet Jury context in mind-by allowing voters to express their uncertainties (see [10] for a similar approach). More precisely, each voter is asked to report its prior probability that some reform (e.g. the Brexit) is the right decision compared to the status quo. This is represented by a number p i ∈ [0, 1] for every voter i = 1, . . . , n. Then aggregate those numbers using proportional-cumulative which coincides with the uniform median rule: p = µ(p 1 , . . . , p n ) = median p 1 , . . . , p n , 0, 1 n , 2 n , . . . , n − 1 n , 1 = sup q∈ [0, 1] #{i ∈ N : p i ≥ q} n ≥ q . Finally, if p > 1/2 = α then the reform is implemented, otherwise, it is not and we keep the status quo. Observe that when all voters are single-minded and vote extreme values (p i ∈ {0, 1} for all i ∈ N ), then p = #{i ∈ N : p i = 1}/n, and so the procedure defines an extension of majority rule. But, as the consequences of making a bad decision can be high compared to the status quo (e.g. the Brexit), one may argue that the optimal α must be higher than 1 2 , perhaps 2 3 ? In theory, the optimal α can be calculated by the maximization of some vNM expected utility of society. That is, we normalize the society vNM utility to 1 if the reform is a good decision and to 0 if the reform is a bad decision, then the optimal α coincide with the vNM utility of the status quo. In practice, the optimal α can be fixed by some committee (e.g. the house of commons) or it can be determined democratically as the median of society individual risk aversions α = median(α 1 , . . . , α n ). Recall that Ψ is level-SP if there is a voting rule g : [0, 1] n → [0, 1] such that for all P and a, Ψ (P)(a) = g(P1(a), . . . , Pn(a)). Theorem 17. A probability aggregation function ψ is level-SP and is certainty preserving if and only if its associated CAF satisfies level-independence. Proof. ⇒: Suppose that ψ is level-SP and is certainty preserving. Let a < b < M = sup Λ and r be such that ga(r) < g b (r). Then for P ∈ C n such that for all experts i we have Pi(a) = Pi(b) = ri one contradicts certainty preservation. Therefore there is g such that for all a < M , Ψ (P)(a) = g(P1(a), . . . , Pn(a)). In conclusion, we have shown that ψ is level-independent. ⇐: Suppose that ψ is level-independent and level-SP. Denote by g the associated (necessarily one-SP) voting rule. Let A be an internal in Λ. Let us suppose that all experts agree that A is impossible, e.g. pi(A) = 0 for every i ∈ N . Then pi(A) = Pi(sup A) − lim a<inf A,a→inf A Pi(a) = 0. Therefore Ψ (P)(sup A) − lim a<inf A,a→inf A Ψ (P)(a) = g(P1(sup A), . . . , Pn(sup A)) − lim a<inf A,a→inf A g(P1(a), .., Pn(a)) = 0, the first equality is a consequence of level independence and the second from the continuity g (that can be deduced from the Moulin's characterization). Hence ψ(p)(A) = 0 and by sigma-additivity it follows that for any A Borel measurable we also have that if all experts agree that A is impossible, this is preserved by the aggregation function. Therefore ψ is certainty preserving. Corollary 3. A probability aggregation function ψ : P N → P is level-SP and certainty preserving if and only if the associated phantom functions fS : Λ → [0, 1] are constant over Λ/supΛ. Therefore they can be chosen without loss of generality as constants over Λ. Proof. ⇒: We have shown that Ψ is level-independent, therefore Ψ (P)(a) = g(P1(a), . . . , PN (a)). As such g is one-SP and is defined by constant phantom values. It follows that the phantom functions are constants. ⇐: Suppose the phantom functions fS are all constants. Then for all i = 1, .., n, and for any a, b such that Pi(a) = Pi(b) we have Ψ (P)(a) = Ψ (P)(b). Therefore ψ is level-independent (and level-SP) and so satisfies certainty preservation (as shown in the previous proof). A probability aggregation function ψ : P N → P is level-SP, anonymous, and certainty preserving if and only if there is n phantom values f1 ≤ · · · ≤ fn ∈ [0, 1] such that such that Ψ : C N → C the CAF associated to ψ verifies the following: ∀a ∈ Λ, Ψ (P1, . . . , Pn)(a) = median(P1(a), . . . , Pn(a), f1, . . . , fn, 1). Proof. Identical to the above while using the Moulin anonymous characterization. Theorem 18. A probability aggregation function ψ : P N → P is level-SP and plausibility preserving if and only if the associated One-SP family {ga}a∈Λ satisfies: and ga is not a constant equal to 0 or 1 for any a = sup Λ. Proof. ⇒: Suppose that ψ verifies plausibility preservation. Let us suppose that there is a < b and r ∈ {0, 1} N such that ga(r) = g b (r). Then for experts such that Pi(c) = 1 − (b − c) if ri = 1 and Pi(c) = c − a if ri = 0 for an ¿ 0 small enough, we have by plausibility preservation that Ψ (P)(a) < g b (P)(b). This is true no matter how small > 0 is. Since for = 0 we have Ψ (P)(a) = g b (P(b)), we can conclude by level-SP that Ψ (P)(a) = g b (P(b)) ∈ {0, 1}. As such ga is not strictly increasing it is worth 0 or 1. ⇐: Suppose we have a < b, and all experts agree that Pi(b) − Pi(a) > 0. If Ψ (P)(a) = 1 then since Pi(a) < 1 for all i we have ga constant equal to 1 (by level-SP), which contradicts the assumption. Therefore Ψ (P)(a) = 1. Similarly, Ψ (P)(b) = 0. Therefore Ψ (P)(a) < Ψ (P)(b). Consequently, ψ verifies plausibility preservation. Corollary 5. A probability aggregation function ψ : P N → P is level-SP and plausibility preserving if and only if any associated phantom functions fS is strictly increasing on the interval where its value is not in {0, 1} and f ∅ (a) < 1 for any a < sup Λ and fN (a) > 0 for any a > inf Λ. Proof. ⇒: Since we have: We have that the fS functions verify: with equality iff f ∅ (b) = 1 or fN (a) = 0. Therefore as long as the conditions for equality do not happen, we verify plausibility preservation. Corollary 6. A probability aggregation function ψ : P N → P is level-SP, plausibility preserving and anonymous if and only if each phantom function f k is strictly increasing on the interval where its value is not in {0, 1} and f1(a) < 1 for any a < sup Λ and fn+1(a) > 0 for any a > inf Λ. Proof. Identical to the above while using the anonymous characterization. Theorem 19. A probability aggregation function ψ is level-SP, certainty preserving and plausibility preserving if and only if the output of its associated one-SP aggregation rule g always output one of its inputs (e.g. g(r1, . . . , rn) ⊂ {r1, . . . , rn} for every (r1, . . . , rn) ∈ [0, 1] N ). Proof. ⇒:Suppose that for any a < sup Λ, g(s1, . . . , sn) ∈ {s1, . . . , sn} then by one-SP there is r ∈ {0, 1} N such that g(s1, . . . , sn) = g(r1, . . . , rn) (if si < g(s1, . . . , sn), define ri = 0 and if si > g(s1, . . . , sn), define ri = 1). Since ψ is plausibility preserving for any r ∈ {0, 1} N , we have that the function a → ga(r) is strictly increasing when not equal to 0 or 1. Since ψ is level-independent a → ga(r) must be a constant. It follows that it is worth 0 or 1. As such g(s1, . . . , sn) ∈ {0, 1}. Suppose g(s1, . . . , sn) = 0, then by one-SP 0 = g(s1, . . . , sn) = g(1, . . . , 1) = 1. This is impossible. Similarly if g(s1, . . . , sn) = 1, then by one-SP g = g(s1, . . . , sn) = g(0, . . . , 0) = 0 (certainty preservation). This is impossible. Therefore, we reach a contradiction and conclude that g(s1, . . . , sn) ∈ {s1, . . . , sn}. ⇐: Suppose that there is a g such that for all a, for all r, Ψ (P)(a) = g(P(a)) ⊂ {P1(a), . . . , Pn(a)} with g One-SP and onto. Then ψ is certainty preserving and level-SP. We also have ∀r ∈ {0, 1} N , f (r) ∈ {0, 1}. Therefore ψ is plausibility preserving. Proof. ⇒: Let g be the rule given by level-independence, for all r we have g(r) ∈ {0, 1} therefore all fS are in {0, 1}. ⇐: Since phantoms functions are constants, ψ is certainty preserving and since for all r we have g(r) ∈ {0, 1} and that f ∅ = 0 and fN = 1, ψ is plausibility preserving. A probability aggregation function is anonymous, level-SP, certainty and plausibility preserving if and only if its associated one-SP aggregation rule is an order function. Proof. ⇒: As shown above, all fS are in {0, 1} and since g(r) = median(r1, . . . , rn, f1, . . . , fn+1) for some f1 ≤ · · · ≤ fn+1, there is k such that 0 = f1 = f2 = · · · = f k−1 < f k = f k+1 = · · · = 1. Thus, we deduce that g(r) is always the k-th greatest element of r and so g is an order function. ⇐: Since an order function can be written as median(r1, . . . , rn, f1, . . . , fn+1) where all the phantoms are worth 0 or 1, the corresponding ψ is anonymous, certainty preserving, plausibility preserving and level-SP. Theorem 20. A probability aggregation function ψ : P N → P is level-SP, certainty preserving and plausibility preserving if and only if when all the experts are dominating each other the outcome is one of the inputs. Proof. Suppose that ψ is level-SP plausibility and certainty preserving and that the Pi are strictly dominating each other. Without loss of generality let us choose the Pi with the i in increasing order. For any a, let Ψ (P)(a) = Pi(a). There is such an i since all phantoms are constants in {0, 1}. We therefore have that fS−i = 0 and fS = 1. It follows that Ψ (P) = Pi. By continuity we have that this is true even if the domination is not strict. ⇐: Let us suppose level-SP and that whenever the input is a set of dominated functions, the outcome is one of the inputs. For any given a < sup Λ let us consider the one-SP rule ga associated to a. Since the outcome is always one of the inputs, we deduce that the phantom voters for ga are all equal to 0 or 1 (if not we could create a situation where one of the phantoms is chosen at some point by selecting an appropriate set of dominated expertise). As such the outcome of ga only depends on the order of the inputs. Since for all a the order of the inputs when considering dominating Pi are the same and since the outcome always corresponds to the same expert, it follows that all ga are equal. Therefore the phantom functions fS are constants in {0, 1}. Therefore we are certainty preserving and plausibility preserving. Recall that the weighted proportionality axiom says the following: If experts are single-minded (every i'vote pi equals the Dirac mass at ai ∈ Λ, e.g. pi = δa i , ∀i ∈ N ), the aggregation must coincide with the weighted average: ∀(a1, . . . , an) ∈ Λ N ψ(δa 1 , . . . , δa n ) = i wiδa i ; where wi ≥ 0 is the normalized weight attributed to expert i ∈ N , with j∈N wj = 1. Theorem 21 (Weighted Proportional-Cumulative). The unique probability aggregation function ψ : P n → P that satisfy the level-SP and weighted proportional axioms is the unique level-independent one associated to the SP-Moulin aggregation rule µw that is: Let ψ be level-SP and weighted proportional. Let Ψ be the CAF associated to ψ and fS be its phantom functions. Let us first show that (w.l.o.g): ∀S ⊆ N, ∀a ∈ Λ : fS(a) = i∈S wi. Let us take any S ⊆ N and a < sup Λ. Suppose that all experts i ∈ S are single-minded in a and all other experts are single-minded in any b > a. By weighted proportional we therefore have ga(P(a)) = i∈S wi. By level-SP we have ga(P(a)) = fS(a). We conclude that for all alternatives a < sup Λ we have fS(a) = i∈S wi and we can assume without loss of generality that this also holds for a = sup Λ. Hence we conclude that the phantoms associated to ψ are the constant phantom functions fS = i∈S wi. Consequently, ga is independent on a (the phantoms as constant), and we denote by g that common function (which is the one-SP rule associated to ψ). We want to show that g = µw, that is for all a ∈ Λ and for all r ∈ [0, 1] N : ga(r) = g(r) = µw(r). -Suppose that there is j such that g(r) = rj, then there is S and S = S − {k|rj = r k } such that for all k ∈ S, we have rj = min(fS, min k∈S r k ) and rj ≤ f S (Moulin's characterization). • For any y > rj, we have i:r i ≥y wi ≤ i:r i >r j wi = f S ≤ rj < y. Therefore by definition of µw we have µw(r) ≤ rj. • For any y ≤ rj, we have i:r i ≥y wi ≥ i:r i ≥r j = fS ≥ rj ≥ y. Therefore by definition of µw, µw(r) ≥ rj. By combining the above we obtain that if there is j such that g(r) = rj, then µw(r) = rj. -Suppose that there is no i such that g(r) = ri, then by Moulin's characterization there is an S such that g(r) = fS. According to Moulin's characterization fS = min(fS, mini∈S ri) therefore if k ∈ S then r k > fS. Suppose there is an i such that if k ∈ S and r k > fS then for S = S ∪ r k since f S ≥ fS we have min(f S , min i∈S ri) ≥ fS. Therefore according to Moulin's characterization fS = f S . It follows that we can choose S such that for all k ∈ S, r k < fS. • For any y > fS we have i:r i ≥y wi ≤ i:r i ≥f S wi = fS < y, therefore µw(r) ≤ rj. • For y ≤ rj, we have i:r i ≥y wi ≥ i:r i ≥f S wi = fS ≥ y therefore µw(r) ≥ fS. Therefore µw(r) = fS. It follows that g = µw. ⇐: If Ψ is the level independent associated to µw then for r ∈ {0, 1} N . We have µw(r) = i:r i =1 wi. As such we verify weighted proportionality. . Since all the experts have the same weight, we are anonymous. We can therefore use Moulin's anonymous characterization. By considering r ∈ {0, 1} d we find, by definition of a proportional method, µ d = ( i ri)/d. It follows that the phantom value fi in Moulin median characterization is fi = i/d. Now that we have established the characterization of µ d , we wish to establish that if we have n experts such that each expert has weight si/d where si ∈ N, then: ∀r, µw(r) = µ d ( We can simply consider that for each expert i, if expert i has weight wi = si/d then he is duplicated so as to appear si times in the anonymous case with d experts. Proposition 4 (Proportional-cumulative for dominated opinion). Suppose that Λ is an interval, and that all the Pi are continuous and verify for all i ∈ N , Pi ≥ Pi+1. Then the weighted-proportional level-SP mechanism ψ : P N → P of weight w can be computed for this input profile as follows: Proof. Suppose for all i ∈ N , Pi ≥ Pi+1. Then µw(P(a)) = sup y : i:P i (a)≥y wi ≥ y . -Suppose that k≤j−1 w k ≤ Pj(a) < k≤j w k . Let us determine µw(P(a)). • For y > Pi(a) we have {k : P k (a) ≥ y} ⊆ {k < j}. Therefore k:P k (a)≥y w k ≤ k<j w k ≤ Pi(a) < y. Therefore µw(P(a)) ≤ Pi(a). • For y ≤ Pi(a) we have {k ≤ j} ⊆ {k : P k (a) ≥ y}. As such k:P k (a)≥y w k ≥ k≤j w k ≥ Pi(a) ≥ y. We have therefore shown that µw(P(a)) = Pj(a). By continuity and monotony of the Pi's there is a1 ≤ a such that Pj(a1) = k≤j−1 w k and a2 > a such that Pj(a1) = k≤j w k . Therefore on the interval [a1, a2], Ψ (P) = Pj. It follows that ψ(p)(a) = pj(a). -Suppose that there is no j such that k≤j−1 w k ≤ Pj(a) < k≤j w k . Then there is a j such that Ψ (P)(a) = k≤j w k , Pj+1(a) < k≤j w k < Pj(a). By continuity of the Pi's there is a1 < a such that Ψ (P)(a1) = Pj(a1) = k≤j w k and a2 > a1 such that Ψ (P)(a2) = Pj+1(a2) = k≤j w k . Therefore Ψ (P)(a1) = Ψ (P)(a2). It follows that ψ(p)(a) = 0. D.1 With L 1 (P)-SP Proposition 5 (Impossibility 1). When #Λ ≥ 4, there are at least 3 experts and the mechanism is certainty preserving, level-SP and L1(P)-SP are incompatible. Proof. Let us consider a certainty preserving level-SP method and 4 alternatives a1 ≺ a2 ≺ a3 ≺ a4. For more than 3 players, we simply consider duplicates of the same player, the proof, therefore, remains the same. Therefore, we assume w.l.o.g. 3 players. Let P1(a1) = P3(a3) = 0 and P1(a2) = 1. Let us suppose that f {1,2} < 1, let > 0 be small enough so that Therefore, we have contradicted L1(P)-SP. Theorem 23 (Impossibility 4). For 3 or more experts, there are no level-SP probability aggregation functions that satisfy diversity and preserve plausibility. Proof. Suppose that ψ : P N → P is a level-SP probability aggregation function that satisfies diversity and preserves plausibility. Then since diversity implies certainty preservation and that we require plausibility preservation, we have all the fS ∈ {0, 1} N . Since diversity also implies that fS is strictly increasing with S. By pigeonhole principle, we reach a contradiction. An interesting question now is: can we guarantee more diversity? Theorem 24 (Impossibility 5). When there are at least 3 alternatives and 2 players there are no methods such that the outcomes support is always the union of the input support. Proof. It is immediate that the property ""outcomes support is always the union of the input support"" implies certainty preservation. Let g be the associated One-SP voting rule. If one of the phantoms is not {0, 1} then we can move the players around such that that phantom is selected on an interval where at least one player is increasing. This is a contradiction. Therefore we are plausibility preserving. By taking a set of dominated inputs we can create a situation where on an interval [a, b] the outcome does not change but one of the players input is increasing.@story_separate@This paper studies the probability aggregation problem when the set of outcomes Λ is an ordered set. It defines level-strategyproofness and proves it to imply classical strategyproofness for a rich set of singlepeaked preferences over the CDF space. Several characterizations, possibility, and impossibility theorems are established when level-strategyproofness is combined with other axioms and two methods are singled out: middlemost-cumulative and proportional-cumulative. Both methods are easy to compute and can be extended to problems where experts are weighted. The paper gives several arguments supporting the claim that the weighted proportional-cumulative is the best of all level-SP methods. Its unique weakness is the non-satisfaction of plausibility preservation. Despite the fact no unanimous level-SP method satisfies the stronger Borel plausibility preservation, the proportional-cumulative method does satisfy level plausibility preservation. Namely, if all experts agree that the probability of a level set is positive, so does society. Hence, if we are interested in problems where the final decision is level-based, then proportional-cumulative is probably the best incentive compatible method. In practice, the weighted proportional-cumulative can be used to aggregate experts beliefs in various applications going from nuclear safety, investment banking, volcanology, public health, ecology, engineering to climate change and aeronautics/aerospace. Specific examples include calculating the risks to manned spaceflight due to collision with space debris and quantifying the uncertainty of a groundwater transport model used to predict future contamination with hazardous materials (see Cooke [12] , Chapter 15, where those applications and others with real data are described and several aggregation methods are analyzed). Proportional-cumulative can also be combined with some existing voting methods, such as majority rule, approval voting, or majority judgment, to construct methods for electing and ranking where experts can express their uncertainties/doubts about the merit/quality of the candidates/alternatives. Since majority judgment is quite successful in practice, 18 we may expect that its uncertain version will also be of practical interest. We see several possibilities for extension. A first direction is a definition of level-SP for a multidimensional Λ -or more generally a metric space Λ-and characterizing all the level-SP methods. A second direction is a formal study of all the voting methods where experts are allowed to express their uncertainties and characterizing the remaining methods for some given set of axioms. Lemma 2 (Monotony). If Ψ is level-SP then for all experts i, for all levels a ∈ Λ, and all CDF votes P1, . . . , Pn, P i : Proof. We will use a reductio ad absurdum to reach our result. Suppose that Ψ verifies level-SP but is not monotonous in all a ∈ Λ. Then there is Pi, P i and a such that Pi(a) ≤ P i (a) and Ψ (P)(a) > Ψ (P−1(P i ))(a). If Ψ (P−1(P i ))(a) ≥ Pi(a). Then: This contradicts level-SP. If Ψ (P)(a) ≤ P i (a). Then: Then replacing P i (a) by Pi(a) improves the output, this contradicts level-SP. Else: This contradicts level-SP. Therefore level-SP implies monotony. . Since a → ga must be right continuous and increasing when the inputs are right continuous and increasing (it is necessary if we want the outcome to be a CDF), it follows that so are a → fS(a) for every S (take experts reports such that of i ∈ S then Pi ≥ fS else Pi ≤ fS. Then the outcome is always fS). Since we want the outcome of Ψ to be a CDF we need: ⇐: Let ga(r) := sup S⊆N min (fS(a), mini∈S ri). As ga is one-SP for every a (it respects Moulin's representation), we deduce that Ψ is level-SP. The increasing right continuity of the fS functions provide that the outcome is right continuous and increasing if the inputs are. Since lima→sup Λ fN (a) = 1, we have (using the formula) that lima→sup Λ, min (fN (a), mini∈S Pi(a)) = 1. As such lima→sup Λ, Ψ (P)(a) = 1. • : Unanimity is immediate from the conditions for unanimity on a one-SP rule from Moulin's characterization. Proof. Identical to the above while using the anonymous characterization of one-SP.","In the problem of aggregating experts' probabilistic predictions over an ordered set of outcomes, we introduce the axiom of level-strategy\-proofness (level-SP) and prove that it is a natural notion with several applications. Moreover, it is a robust concept as it implies incentive compatibility in a rich domain of single-peakedness over the space of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). This contrasts with the literature which assumes single-peaked preferences over the space of probability distributions. Our main results are: (1) a reduction of our problem to the aggregation of CDFs; (2) the axiomatic characterization of level-SP probability aggregation functions with and without the addition of other axioms; (3) impossibility results which provide bounds for our characterization; (4) the axiomatic characterization of two new and practical level-SP methods: the proportional-cumulative method and the middlemost-cumulative method; and (5) the application of proportional-cumulative to extend approval voting, majority rule, and majority judgment methods to situations where voters/experts are uncertain about how to grade the candidates/alternatives to be ranked.\footnote{We are grateful to Thomas Boyer-Kassem, Roger Cooke, Aris Filos-Ratsikas, Herv\'e Moulin, Clemens Puppe and some anonymous EC2021 referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.} \keywords{Probability Aggregation Functions \and ordered Set of Alternatives \and Level Strategy-Proofness \and Proportional-Cumulative \and Middlemost-Cumulative}"
"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), has caused an international pandemic, with over 32 million cases and more than 500,000 deaths nationwide. With the significant health consequences seen secondary to COVID-19, healthcare disparities have been further exacerbated 1 . Not only are infection rates higher in Black,m Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) and marginalized populations, but consequences and complications following COVID-19 infection are significantly elevated as well. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that some BIPOC populations experience hospitalization after COVID-19 infection at a rate more than threefold higher than white populations 1 . The reasons that have been proposed to account for differential morbidity and mortality seen during the COVID-19 pandemic are multifactorial. Social determinants of health play a central role in the disparities seen. Vulnerable BIPOC communities historically have experienced generations of systemic divestment which has led to large gaps in infrastructure and resources. In this review of the literature, we outline the unique barriers to health care and highlight specific disparities which are associated with particular communities most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. While this summary does not capture the totality of disparities affecting communities across the United States, it highlights trends in many vulnerable populations.@story_separate@The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected the Black population in the United States. Analysis of racial trends from the summer of 2020 suggest that infection and death rates in Black counties were 3-and 6-times that in predominantly white counties, respectively 2 . This trend is most pronounced in rural Black communities 3 . This is demonstrated in Louisiana, where at one point early in the pandemic, Black residents accounted for 72% of COVID-19 deaths while only comprising 32% of the state's population 4 . The causes of this disparity are numerous, with underlying medical conditions and social determinants of health having a significant impact. Unfortunately, the health conditions that increase the risk for poor outcomes in COVID-19 are the same conditions already seen at higher rates in the Black population. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, liver disease, and autoimmune disease are underlying health conditions that disproportionately affect Black patients. Additionally, minorities and low-income individuals are more likely to be essential workers and less likely to be able to work remotely 3 putting these individuals at increased risk. It is also worth noting that people in these communities are often subjected to higher density living environments and experience poorer access to insurance and health care 3 . The aforementioned issues are further compounded by the inherent mistrust of the medical field that exists in Black communities in response to decades of racist actions and policies that have negatively impacted marginalized groups. These factors have resulted in a community that is both medically vulnerable yet skeptical of the medical system. This medical skepticism and lack of entrustment has resulted in limited testing and vaccination in the Black community, both of which are key components to improving outcomes in COVID-19. With respect to vascular specific manifestations, COVID-19 leads to a hypercoagulable state in many affected patients. Motaganahalli and colleagues looked at deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in COVID-19 patients, and though it did not reach significance, 61% of the patients studied that developed a DVT were African American 5 . Similarly, in a study of patients at a New York City health care system, nearly one third of patients with acute thrombotic manifestations of COVID-19 were African American 5 . Regrettably, many of the sources reviewed for this article did not report complete demographic information that included race. Even the CDC data is incomplete with race and ethnicity data available for only 51% of reported COVID cases 1,6 . These shortcomings in reporting demographic data highlight the need for mandated reporting of race and ethnicity as it relates to COVID-19 outcomes. Amid marked visibility of anti-Asian violence and macroaggression spurred by the pandemic, Asian populations within the United States have also experienced health-related disparities with regards to morbidity, mortality, and access to care for COVID-19. The population described by the term ""Asian"" is diverse, making accurate tabulation difficult. According to the 2020 United States Census, ""Asian -Americans"" are any persons with origins in the ""Far-East"", Southeast Asia and the Indian Subcontinent (e.g., Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam). The Asian Pacific Institute on Gender-Based Violence uses the term Asian or Pacific Islander to denote people with Asian, Asian-American (as defined above) and Pacific-Islander ancestral roots who will be referred to here as AA (Asian-American) or AAPI (Asian-American/Pacific Islander) 7 . An article by Basset et al. from the Harvard T. Chan School of Public Health studied differences in COVID-19 mortality by race/ethnicity and age 8 . The study provided compelling evidence that compared to non-Hispanic white (NHW) populations, non-Hispanic black (NHB), non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native (NHAIAN), and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (NHAPI) populations had higher mortality in all studied age groups (note these abbreviations were used in the reference and do not necessarily correspond to acronyms in this review). They also calculated ""years of potential life lost (YPLL)"" which was significantly higher in NHB and Hispanic populations compared to NHW, indicating a prominent risk of premature death (<65y) in these group 8 . The authors concluded that as of July 2020, mortality rates from COVID-19 were higher in Hispanics, NHB, NHAIAN and NHAPI groups than in NHW particularly in people older than 55 years of age 8 . Nationally, statistics on mortality from COVID-19 in the spring and summer of 2020 demonstrated slightly lower rates of death in the AA populations (4.4%) than their representation in the country (5.7%) 9 . However, rates varied from state to state. For example, in Nevada, Utah and Nebraska, mortality rates in AAPI populations were almost double the population share (15.4% of deaths with 8.1% population; 5.5% of deaths with 2.4% of population; 5.9% with 2.4% of population, respectively 9 . Others have corroborated state-to-state differences in disease severity and COVID-19 related mortality in AAPI populations 10 Nevada. However, in Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, NHA YPLL were above the percentage of total deaths, indicating that NHA were dying at earlier ages than other groups in a manner that was statistically detectable. In California and Nevada, the statistical analysis demonstrated the opposite finding; NHA were dying at statistically detectable older ages than other groups 10 . The causes for increased regional complications and mortality from COVID-19 in the AA/AAPI population is likely multifactorial. Asian-origin immigrant and refugee populations in the US comprise a significant percentage of the essential workforce in certain areas (including in healthcare), potentially increasing their exposure. For example, case-mortality rates in the San Francisco Bay area for Asian populations was 3%, which was much higher than that for white and other minority groups in the region 11 . Poverty, language barriers, and multigenerational living situations likely exacerbate the risk. One study evaluating refugees from Bhutan and Myanmar, representing 14% and 21% (respectively) of resettled refugee communities in the United States used questionnaires to determine COVID-19 incidence in essential and nonessential workers 12 . Not surprisingly, essential workers had higher self-reported infection, which may be underestimated given the nature of the survey. Fear of anti-Asian violence and racist attacks may also prevent individuals from seeking care. Many AA/AAPI communities including those that have been established for years have experienced a significant amount of xenophobia targeting adults and even children 13 during the pandemic, which has exacerbated mental health issues associated with isolation, and increased the hesitancy to obtain needed medical treatment 12 . Access to vaccinations is also hampered by language barriers that might put some of the less obvious essential workers at risk for developing COVID-19. A recent news report highlighted a disparity in access affecting Sikh truck drivers who make up an estimated 20% of the trucking workforce nationally (40% in California), and are critical to transporting pandemicrelated supplies across the country. Many originally hail from Punjab (a state in northern India). Despite being considered essential workers, truck drivers are not prioritized for vaccination and are not afforded the guarantee of open rest stops, or hazard pay. Furthermore, critical vaccination information is not provided in Punjabi, exacerbating the disparity in healthcare access 14 in this particular population. Racial differences have also been noted in disease severity among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In a report on racial and ethnic differences in presentation and outcomes published in Circulation, Rodriguez et al. showed that Black and Hispanic patients represented more than half of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths across the US. However, Asians presented with the highest severity of cardiorespiratory disease 15 . One explanation for this difference could be that Asian populations, noted in other reports to underutilize health services in part due to fear of racist attacks delay seeking medical attention until symptoms are very severe 15 . Furthermore, the group make up a significant percentage of essential workers who often live in multi-generational homes and are deterred from seeking care by language barriers, racism and fear. Special attention should be paid to attenuating these factors to reduce morbidity and mortality in these groups. Hispanics in the United States have a significantly lower socioeconomic status than NHW which directly becomes a barrier to receiving health care services of high quality that are timely and appropriate, which has become a primary limitation in receiving treatment and testing for COVID-19 16 . Other specifics barriers include degree of acculturation, language and immigration status. The jobs available to recent and undocumented immigrants who lack proficiency in English are unlikely to provide health insurance as a benefit. Hispanics are more to be employed as an essential worker in agriculture, construction, and food services. This puts them at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and less likely to have the resources for testing and treatment. The lack of health insurance makes the costs of health care services prohibitive for many people and is the most important barrier to adequate health care access in this population. Health care disparities amongst African Americans and Hispanics have cost the health care system an additional 5.1 billion dollars, this number is expected to rise to an astounding 65 billion within a decade as the number of Latinos and African Americans in the United States increases and these disparities persist 17 . Data from the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health, reveals that only 49% of the total amount of Hispanic population has private insurance compared to 75 % of the non-Hispanic white population 18 . In terms of public insurance 38% covered Hispanics and a total of 17.8% without any kind insurance reported by the Census Bureau. Many initiatives have been implemented nationally to improve access to care and expand insurance coverage, the Affordable Care Act has given insurance coverage to approximately 10 million Latinos, unfortunately having access to healthcare is not enough given the high copay cost, prescriptions, monthly premiums as well as deductibles, which result in an ongoing barrier 19 . The COVID-19 pandemic has made these gaps even more prominent. As a result, the Latino community has been disproportionally affected by the pandemic, hospitalization rates are almost 5 times higher in Latinos than NHW 20 . Other challenges hindering access to care that have been exacerbated during the pandemic include distance to medical care providers, lower number of Hispanic physicians, cultural and language differences between provider and Hispanic patients, and unconscious bias towards Tracker from the Center for Antiracist Research at Boston University, confirmed COVID cases and related death were compiled by race and ethnicity to quantify potential disparities 21 . Cases and mortality were analyzed in relation to the relative population in the region and expressed as a representation quotient (% incidence / %population). RQ for AIAN and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NHPI) were 1.303 and 1.115, indicating a 30% and 11% increase in cases relative to the representative population, respectively 21 . Not surprisingly, marked regional differences not only in incidence but also in mortality were seen in many BIPOC groups. In a recurrent theme, these regional differences in racial/ethnic disparities appeared to depend on the representation of essential workers 22 . Social determinants of health defined by the World Health Organization as ""the social, physical and economic conditions that impact upon health"" 22 add greatly to COVID-related disparities in Indigenous communities in the United States. Factors contributing to disparate COVID-19 infection, morbidity and mortality in AIAN and NHPI include lack of indoor plumbing, language barriers, multigenerational living and unreliable internet access to help disseminate information 22 . Disturbingly, lack of federal recognition of certain tribes due to technical oversights and disputes over historical treaties render some AIAN communities unable to access federally funded testing and vaccination initiatives. For example, the $31B infusion into tribal communities by the COVID-19 relief bill does not benefit members of unrecognized tribes such as the Chinook Nation in Southwest Washington State, which has been forced to ask neighboring tribes for access to vaccines. Indeed, such tribal nations cannot benefit from resources provided to the Indian Health Service (IHS), exacerbating treatment opportunities if infection is present 23 . Some of the risk factors that put AIAN communities at risk for COVID-19 infection are more indirect. Food insecurity in many Native communities has been shown to correlate with Type 2 diabetes, obesity and hypertension 24 , putting individuals at increased risk from COVID-19 related complications. Food insecurity, defined as unreliable and unpredictable access to nutrient dense foods, is exacerbated by poverty and so-called ""food-desserts"" 25 . One group of researchers estimated food insecurity in AIAN communities nationally by evaluating data from the Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement, a survey distributed to approximately 50,000 households. AIAN had 20% greater odds of food insecurity than White counterparts; not surprisingly, poverty correlated strongly with experiences of food insecurity across race and ethnicity. AIAN communities in the Pacific states, Southern Plains and Alaska had the highest rates of food insecurity, highlighting marked regional differences in reliable access to nutrient rich foods 26 . Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated food insecurity across almost all demographics in the United States, and for those communities already experiencing nutritional disparities, the strain has been amplified 27 . Thus, to decrease the morbidity and morality of COVID-19 in AIAN and NHPI groups, the approach must address not only basic provisions but also systemic injustice. These would include easy access to nutritionally dense food, health information in tribal-specific languages, clean water, and internet. Additionally, barriers that exist to recognizing tribal people need to be removed to facilitate delivery of IHS services as well as COVID-19 monies earmarked for American Indian communities. Census 2010 estimates that nearly 60 million individuals live in rural locations that encompass 95% of the nation's land mass and nearly 20% of the United States population 28 . Compared to urban populations, rural residents tend to be older, have more comorbidities and higher rates of high risk behaviors, lower income, and are often uninsured or underinsured [28] [29] [30] . Counties with a higher proportion of rural residents tend to have fewer primary care providers and surgeons 30, 31 . and have long suffered after the closure of over 120 rural hospitals over the last decade 32 Paul et al performed a spatiotemporal analysis of COVID-19 prevalence rates in urban and rural locations and found a rapid progression of spread from urban to rural areas within a 21-day period 33 . Multiple reports document worse adoption of prevention strategies such as donning a face mask and social distancing, lower testing rates, and higher infection rates in ages 25-49 in rural areas, which likely contributed to increased spread of the virus in these locations [33] [34] [35] . When hospitalized for COVID-19, rural residents were less likely to be enrolled in a clinical trial testing the effectiveness of therapeutics 36 . Overall, mortality rates due to COVID-19 are higher in urban areas, however, mortality rates in numerous rural counties, metropolitan small areas, and nonmetropolitan areas surpassed those of large cities 33 . Vaccine hesitancy exists throughout the nation, however, particularly in rural populations with a recent study showing that only 31% of rural respondents say they will ""definitely get"" a COVID-19 vaccine 37 . Some posit this may be secondary to the social determinants of health such as education level and resident segregation 38 . The intersection of race, ethnicity, and rurality must be addressed in parallel. Multiple reports from across the country demonstrated higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death among BIPOC 39 . These findings hold true in rural populations with higher death rates among rural BIPOC residents 40, 41 The effects of the pandemic affected those who did not contract COVID-19, but suffer from chronic disease. While the use of telehealth helped reduce exposure for patients and healthcare workers alike, poor internet connectivity, device operability, regulatory restrictions, state reimbursement, geographic constraints, quality of care, and provider as well as patient acceptance barriers were exposed, that limiting adoption of telehealth solutions. These concerns remained despite sweeping regulatory flexibility made possible after various policy changes in response to the pandemic 42, 43 . A study reviewing telehealth utilization among surgeons in Michigan demonstrated 34-fold increase in telehealth utilization soon after the start of the pandemic with a sharp drop to near pre-pandemic levels thereafter 44, 45 . Furthermore, this study found that patients in rural areas were significantly less likely to use telehealth visits. Within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ) community, COVID-19 has exacerbated the health consequences of an already marginalized patient population. With regards to the COVID pandemic, LGBTQ+ persons face unique health challenges that puts them at compounded risk. Additionally, LGBTQ+ persons are historically excluded from policy-level responses to large-scale disasters, making the intervention and resolution of these disparities difficult to perform. LGBTQ persons have greater rates of chronic disease compared to their non-LGBTQ+ counterparts. Rates of diabetes, coronary artery disease, cancer, HIV, and asthma have all been reported to be higher in LGBTQ+ populations 46, 47 . As such, LGBTQ individuals are more likely to be immunocompromised and more vulnerable to infection. Access to appropriate medical care is also compromised in the COVID pandemic. In an analysis of 1,051 online surveys distributed during the pandemic to men who have sex with men, Sanchez et al found that respondents reported increased challenges in accessing HIV testing, prevention, and treatment services 48 . These access problems are compounded by the fact that LGBTQ populations experience reduced access to health care at baseline, with 17% of LGBTQ persons without any healthcare coverage compared to 12% in non-LGBTQ individuals 49 . Additionally, prior to the pandemic, LGBTQ individuals reported inadequate care due to previous stigmatizing experiences in health care settings, and lack of provider knowledge on health care needs 48 . Overall, this suggests that these the COVID pandemic has resulted in multiple intersecting disparities that has further disadvantaged the LGBTQ community. In addition to chronic physical conditions, mental health is much more prevalent in LGBTQ populations 49, 50 . In fact, LGBTQ populations report increased risk of violence, discrimination, exclusion, loneliness, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and suicide 51 . Community engagement has been shown to allow for strong sense of identity and selfacceptance among LGBTQ youth 50 . Social distancing has removed important coping resources from these individuals, such as school/college organizations, coaches, counsellors, teachers/professors, peers, etc. Removing these strategies could result in increased risk of violence, discrimination, exclusion, loneliness, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, suicide etc 51 . LGBTQ elders are 2 times more likely to be single and living alone, 4 times less likely to have kids, and more likely to be estranged from biological families further exacerbating social isolation and loneliness 50 . The COVID-19 pandemic has already resulted in increased psychological stress in general; this lack of support within LGBTQ populations further predisposes these individuals to the deleterious psychological consequences of the pandemic. Social distancing measures also contributes to exacerbated psychological concerns. School closings, virtual college courses, and virtual work has resulted in many LGBTQ youth to be confined in unsupportive homes. In fact, one third of LGBTQ youth report family rejection and another third report that they came out to family as adults 52 . Suicide is 8 times higher in LGBTQ young persons who have unsupportive family, and depression is 6 times higher 50 While there are established physical and mental health consequences to the COVID pandemic, these may be further compounded by lack of policy-level response. Historically, there has been discrimination in accessing emergency government services because of LGBTQ status. Sexual orientation and/or identity are rarely collected in epidemiological surveillance 50 . Furthermore, LGBTQ individuals experience higher levels of poverty, food insecurity, homelessness, lack of health insurance, and unemployment compared to non-LGBTQ populations 55, 56 . 40% of LGBTQ persons work in the service industry, compared to 22% in non- LGBTQ populations, putting them at even higher risk of unemployment during the pandemic 51 . Due to the lack of responsiveness in the past to marginalized populations and lack of epidemiological surveillance, it is hard to quantify the impact of a pandemic in this population. Addressing and quantifying these unique challenges and disparities will be essential in order to properly care for the health consequences imposed on this population by a pandemic. Incarcerated persons are uniquely vulnerable to the health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The case rate for COVID-19 for incarcerated individuals is 5.5 times higher than the non-incarcerated population and death rate is 3 times higher than the non-incarcerated population (57) . These populations are predisposed to poor outcomes given higher rates of preexisting health conditions, the overcrowded environment, and lack of autonomy. The high rates of pre-existing conditions in incarcerated persons can lead to detrimental consequences of COVID-19 infection. In fact, 60% of all incarcerated individuals have at least one chronic disease (57) . Also, there are many diseases such as hypertension and liver disease that have a higher incidence in incarcerated individuals (57) . As stated previously, chronic conditions such as these put people infected with COVID-19 at an increased risk for a complicated course and mortality. Incarcerated individuals, therefore, are at increased risk of being negatively impacted by the pandemic. Social distancing is next to impossible in correctional facilities. As a congregate living facility, transmission is rapid and unavoidable. There are programs for ""decarcerating"" individuals of low offense crimes (58) however, due to the lack of space, limited staff, and shared spaces, there remains high rates of transmission in correctional facilities (59) . Similar trends have been seen with other infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, influenza, pneumonia, and HIV (57) . Higher rates of transmission and infection leaves this population vulnerable and amplifies the effects of the pandemic in these facilities. Lack of autonomy and freedoms puts incarcerated populations at increased risk. They are often tasked with high-risk jobs that increases their risk. For example, in November 2020, incarcerated persons worked in morgues (60) . Situations such as these leave these populations vulnerable and without adequate protections. Furthermore, with their inability to vote, they do not have a voice in resisting these measures. As with imprisoned populations, there are other detained persons who face similar adversities. Immigrant detention centers pose similar risks with regards to lack of social distancing and lack of autonomy. It is imperative to address these populations pragmatically and diligently in order to avoid the untoward affects the heightened risks create. ☒ The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.@story_separate@The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated known disparities in already vulnerable communities. The intersections of pre-existing health disparities as well as chronic divestment in specific communities such as those outlined here has resulted in not only higher rates of infection and complications but has accentuated the barriers to health that many Americans face. Addressing these disparities will require changes on multiple levels of society. Including variables such as race and socioeconomic factors in datasets reporting incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 is an important initial step to better study and quantify the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had. On a physician level, population-based action plans are needed to protect our nation's vulnerable residents. Increasing the number of medical students who identify with any of the preceding communities will allow for a more diverse physician pool that reflects the patient population that it treats and increases the volume and distribution of the provider workforce. However, a sustainable response requires changes at the policy level, including improving access to care by expanding programs such as Medicaid and improving strength in infrastructure and resources for vulnerable communities and hospitals.","COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), has caused an international pandemic, with over 32 million cases and more than 500,000 deaths nationwide. With the significant health consequences seen secondary to COVID-19, healthcare disparities have been further exacerbated. Mechanisms that have been proposed to account for the increased disparity seen during the COVID-19 pandemic are multifactorial. This review of the literature outlines the unique barriers to health and disparities which are associated with vulnerable communities who have been most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States."
"Next generation sequencing technologies are used to screen environmental and clinical samples for the presence of viral pathogens. This has resulted in discovery of new, previously unknown viruses that are often uncultivable (Victoria et al., 2008; Li et al., 2009; Phan et al., 2012; Reuter et al., 2012) . These technologies have allowed screening of samples collected from domestic animals (Shan et al., 2011; Phan et al., 2011; Reuter et al., 2012) and from animals in the wild to determine if they are carriers of potentially zoonotic viral pathogens (Donaldson et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010; Phan et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012) . Additionally, deep sequence analysis was applied to screening of commercially available vaccines for the presence of contaminants and variants . Methods to sequence complete viral genomes have been developed. These include methodologies based on PCR amplification of viral sequences, both in fragments (Rao et al., 2013) or fulllength genome amplification (Christenbury et al., 2010) . These have primarily focused on specific, closely related viruses. The Sequence-Independent, Single Primer Amplification (SISPA) procedure was first used to amplify DNA populations through the use of random priming and ligation of adaptors for PCR amplification (Reyes and Kim, 1991) . This was modified for amplification of viral sequences from serum to include a step where DNase I was used to first degrade host DNA (Allander et al., 2001) . This protocol has since been used in the identification of a novel pestivirus (Kirkland et al., 2007) , bocaviruses (Cheng et al., 2010) and identification of viruses associated with cytopathic effect in cell cultures of unknown origin (Abed and Boivin, 2009) . Many virological laboratories, especially those associated with diagnostic laboratories, have freezers that contain large numbers of virus isolates collected over varying time spans. Often these isolates have clinical histories associated with them that detail where and when the isolations were made and descriptions of the disease state of the host. There is a wealth of information in these isolates, but up till now, it has been time consuming and expensive to sequence these viral genomes, often requiring sets of strain-specific primers for PCR amplification and sequencing. The protocol outlined in this study provides the means to rapidly sequence archival collections of viruses to study the evolution of specific viruses over time. This information is important in determining the relevance of virus strains used in currently marketed vaccines.@story_separate@Viral isolates passaged in cell culture and stored frozen at −80 • C were used in this study. The two virus groups sequenced were 21 bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) isolates and 19 bovine coronavirus (BoCV) isolates. After isolation/propagation of the viruses on appropriate host cells, the medium was frozen/thawed twice, cell debris removed by centrifugation, and aliquots frozen at −80 • C. Routinely, the libraries were constructed from groups of 10 viruses. The virus stock was thawed at room temperature and 180 l was mixed with 20 l of 10× DNase I buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 25 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM CaCl 2 ). A cocktail of nucleases was added to degrade host nucleic acids as previously described (Victoria et al., 2008) . The cocktail consisted of (per virus sample) 5 units DNase I (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 10 units Turbo-DNase (Life Technologies), 5 units Base-line Zero DNase (Epicenter, Madison, WI, USA), 25 units benzonase (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), 2 g RNase A/5 units RNase T1 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and 4 units RNase One (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The virus stock/nuclease mixture was incubated at 37 • C for at least 90 min. The viral RNA was purified using the MinElute Virus spin filter kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's specifications. The RNA was eluted in 22 l of ultra-pure, RNasefree H 2 O (final yield ∼20 l) and immediately placed on ice. Twenty microliters of RNA were mixed with 100 pmol of a 28mer primer consisting of 20 nucleotides of a known sequence followed by 8 random nucleotides as previously described . Table 1 shows the sequence of the 20 primers used in this study. These primers were developed so that the 20 base known sequence was used for PCR amplification of the library as well as served as a barcode for identifying each viral library following pooling and sequencing. The RNA/primer mix was heated at 75 • C for 5 min and immediately placed on ice. First strand synthesis was done in a reaction mix consisting of 0.5 mM dNTPs, 1× first strand buffer, 2 units RNasin (Promega) and 200 units SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). The first strand reactions were incubated at 42 • C for 1 h, heated at 95 • C for 2 min and immediately quenched on ice. The second strand reaction was carried out using Sequenase 2.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the nucleotides and primers still present following the first strand reaction (Yozwiak et al., 2012 ). An equal volume of 2× Sequenase buffer with 4 units of Sequenase per reaction was added on ice. The reaction tubes were placed in a thermocycler that was prechilled to 4 • C and were ramped from 4 • C to 37 • C at 0.1 • C/s. The reaction was continued at 37 • C for 10 min. The tubes were heated to 95 • C for 2 min and placed immediately on ice. A second aliquot of Sequenase was added (4 units/reaction) and the ramping and incubation repeated with the exception that the 37 • C reaction was done for 30 min. The double stranded cDNA was purified using Minelute PCR spin columns (Qiagen) and eluted with 13 l of ultra-pure H 2 O. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers consisting of the first 20 known bases of the 28mer used in the cDNA synthesis . The PCR reactions consisted of 10 l of double-stranded cDNA, 1× Pfx50 buffer, 400 M dNTPs, 100 pM of appropriate 20mer primer and 5 units of Pfx50 polymerase (Life Technologies). The reactions were cycled at 95 • C for 2 min and 35 cycles of 95 • C for 30 s, 55 • C for 30 s and 72 • C for 1 min. The number of cycles was empirically determined so as not to over amplify the cDNA, where 35 cycles worked well. The DNA was again purified and eluted in 10 l ultra-pure H 2 O, and 1 l subjected to Agilent Bioanalyzer analysis (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The percentage of the DNA that was 300-400 bp in length was determined for each reaction as was the total DNA concentration in each sample using PicoGreen (Life Technologies). All ten reactions were pooled so that the 300-400 bp cDNAs from each were present in equimolar amounts. The pooled DNA was placed in an end-repair reaction (Ion Plus Fragment Library kit, Life Technologies) followed by ligation of Ion Torrent sequencing adaptors. The DNA was size fractionated using Agencourt Ampure Beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) using 1.6 volumes of the Ampure beads and was done according to manufacturer specifications. This step removed DNA of 100 bp and less which eliminated adaptor dimers and unligated adaptors. At this point, two 10-genome libraries, for a total of 20 genomes, were pooled for each sequencing run. The 300-400 bp fraction was isolated from the DNA pool using the Pippin Prep (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA). The 300-400 bp DNA was subjected to sequence analysis with the Ion Torrent PGM and standard chemistries (Life Technologies) using the 316 sequencing chip. The raw data files that contained the sequence data from each sequencing run of the PGM were demultiplexed using the 20 base barcode sequence. The raw sequencing reads obtained from the Ion Torrent sequencer were exported as SFF files. Barcode sequences unique to this study were used to populate a custom configuration file that was used in conjunction with the Roche ""sfffile"" tool to separate the reads into individual barcode-specific SFF files. All the sequences in each barcode-specific SFF file was extracted to a FASTQ file by applying the ""sff extract"" utility (http://bioinf. comav.upv.es/sff extract/index.html) and specifying the ""-clip"" option to remove the sequencing tags, barcode sequences, and low quality sequences. The ""fastx trimmer"" program (part of the Fastx ToolKit; http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx toolkit/index.html) was used to remove the random primer (8-mer) by trimming an additional eight nucleotides from the 5 -end of each read. As a final post-trimming step, a custom script was used to remove all reads that were less than 40 nucleotides in length. The resulting sequence files were used to assemble full length genomic sequences using SeqManNGen and were edited with the SeqMan software of the Lasergene 10 package (DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) using related viral sequences obtained from GenBank as the assembly reference. Assembled genomic sequences were further edited using Aligner (Codoncode, Inc., Centerville, MA, USA). The sequences from each library were submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive with the BioProject number PRJNA237789, BioSamples SAMN02630193, and SAMN02639534 through SAMN02639572. The Ion Torrent raw sequence data was trimmed of sequencing adaptors, barcodes, the 8 base random primer sequence, low quality sequences and sequences less than 40 bases. After preassembly processing of the reads, an average of 82% of initial reads remained for downstream analysis. The BVDV and BoCV sequencing runs produced 954,798 and 2,268,798 individual sequences, respectively. The percentage of viral sequences in each barcoded library varied but was as high as 87% ( Table 2 ). The ratio of virus:host sequences was highly dependent on the titer of virus in the stock sample. The number of sequences for each barcoded sample in the library varied, even following pooling at concentrations that should have resulted in equimolar amounts of each sample in the library. To test the accuracy of the Ion Torrent sequencing, a virus previously sequenced by PCR amplification was included to compare sequences generated by this method and by sequencing PCR amplicons. This virus, a BVDV 1b strain isolated from alpaca (GenBank accession JX297520.1; Table 2 , library 3, barcode 10), was assembled from Ion Torrent data and was found to have only 1 base difference from the sequence determined earlier (data not shown). This base was ambiguous in the amplicon sequenced by Sanger chemistry (equal peak height of A and G) but was clearly a G by Ion Torrent sequencing. The sequences from two libraries were analyzed to determine source of any non-viral sequences. The remaining non-viral sequences were assembled into contigs and were used in BLAST searches of GenBank. This revealed that the non-viral sequences were derived from host nucleic acids, both DNA and RNA. The RNA sequences were primarily ribosomal RNAs but some were from more abundant mRNA transcripts. Assembly of genomic sequences was done using templateassisted assembly. BVDV and BoCV genomic sequences used as templates for assembly were obtained from GenBank (accession numbers JN380086.1 and EF424617.1, respectively). All of the individual virus library sequences resulted in assembled sequences that spanned at least 94% of the genome from which they were derived (Table 2 ). In libraries 1 and 2, BVDV genomic sequences were determined for 20 virus isolates. The percentage of viral sequences for each barcoded library ranged from 34.8 to 87.4%. BVDV assemblies contained no internal gaps but the extreme 5 and 3 termini were not present, with the exception of 3 sequences of four viruses ( Table 2 ). The number of nucleotides missing from the termini varied but ranged from 1 to 98 bases. One virus, library 1, barcode 9, had only 658 viral sequence reads but 94.4% of the genome was assembled. This genomic assembly had 8 internal gaps, ranging from 10 to 219 nucleotides. The other 19 viruses had no assembly gaps and genomic coverages of 99.1-99.9%, depending on variable coverage of the genome termini. The low number of sequences for library 1, barcode 9 was believed to be a result of a pipetting error during the quantitation or pooling of the 10 genomic libraries. The results of sequencing of 19 BoCV isolates are listed in Table 2 , under libraries 3 and 4. The coronavirus genomic RNA is 2.5 times longer than that of BVDV, roughly 31,000 nucleotides versus 12,300. Thus, it required more sequences overall to assemble the complete genome to the same coverage depth. Additionally, because BoCV typically grows to a lower titer, there were lower ratios of virus:host sequences, ranging from 2.7 to 37.8% of the total sequences. A major difference in genome assembly between BVDV and BoCV was that, with only a few exceptions, both the 5 and 3 terminal sequences were determined for each BoCV isolate. Also, due to the longer length of the BoCV genome, more assembly gaps were observed. However, in all cases, assembled sequences spanned more than 97% of the viral genome. More assembly gaps were observed in individual virus libraries having lower total sequences. The BVDV isolate sequenced in library 3, barcode 10 gave results similar to that observed with BVDV isolates sequenced in libraries 1 and 2. The advent of new DNA sequencing technologies has led to the development of improved sequencing protocols for detection and characterization of viruses in environmental and diagnostic samples. Many of these protocols use deep sequencing techniques to detect and identify novel, often uncultivable, viruses. This sequencing protocol was designed to sequence viruses rapidly that were isolated from clinical specimens and archived. Often, a clinical report and history is available for isolates making it possible to begin association of genotype with specific phenotypes and time of isolation. Particularly valuable is that this protocol confers the ability to sequence archival collections of specific viruses rapidly in order to study the evolution of the pathogen over time and determine the genotype of the viruses currently in circulation. This information is useful in determining relevance of vaccine strains based on sequences of currently circulating viruses. The viruses used for sequence analysis were all isolated and passaged in cell culture. Thus, the abundance of host nucleic acids posed a problem in obtaining sufficient numbers of viral sequences to assemble the viral genomes. It was necessary to pre-digest virus samples with high levels of nucleases before purification of viral RNA. The viral RNA was protected within the intact virions while the host RNA and DNA were degraded. The RNA purification procedure included a protease digestion step aiding in the removal of the nucleases before the viral RNA was released from the virion. The nuclease digestion step aided in reaching as much as 87% of all sequences in a barcoded library being of viral origin. Again, the titer of the virus in the original sample was also important in the number of viral sequences obtained. Viruses that grow routinely to low titers require less than 20 libraries in the sequencing run to ensure sufficient reads in each barcoded library to assemble the genomes. An important aspect of this procedure was sequence independence, requiring no previous knowledge of sequence or pathogens present in a sample. The use of 20 base barcode sequence with 8 base random nucleotides (Victoria et al., 2008 ) served both to prime cDNA synthesis and to differentiate each library following sequencing. The 20 base known sequence was also used for PCR amplification of the individual libraries. The Ion Torrent platform was chosen because it allowed variation in the depth of sequencing based on the size of the chip that was used in the sequencing run. For the most part, the 316 chip worked well, routinely giving sufficient sequencing depth to assemble the genomes of 20 viruses in each sequencing run. The Ion Torrent is known to have indels in the sequence data, especially associated with homopolymeric runs of bases (Bragg et al., 2013) . Use of template assisted assembly of the genomes greatly assisted in producing accurate genome assemblies. Limited numbers of de novo assemblies were done and low numbers of errors were found that were attributed to indels. The accuracy of sequences generated by this method was demonstrated by the comparing sequences to those previously generated by Sanger PCR amplicon sequencing. Only 1 nucleotide difference was detected in sequences generated using the two different methods demonstrating the accuracy of the sequencing using the protocol described in this paper. The genomic sequences of the BVDV isolates were readily assembled from the sequence data, partially owing to the relatively small size of the genomic RNA. However, the extreme 5 and 3 terminal nucleotides were difficult to obtain, most likely due to the high degree of secondary structure known to be present in these sequences. This may have made priming of first strand cDNA synthesis near the termini more difficult. With the exception of one virus, all BVDV genomes were assembled with no internal gaps in the sequence. The BVDV genome that was not fully assembled had only 658 total viral sequences, yet this was sufficient to assemble greater than 94% of the genome. The low number of sequences was most like due to a pipetting error during the pooling of the 10 individual genomic libraries. This illustrates the importance of accurate quantitation and pipetting of the individual libraries in making the DNA pool used in the template preparation for sequencing. The BoCV assemblies tended to have more assembly gaps, due in part to the longer genomic RNA of these viruses. Conversely, the genome termini of the BoCV were determined more often then the BVDV, the reasons for which are unclear. The assemblies containing the most gaps were those that had lower numbers of total sequences. Still, the sequences spanned greater than 97% of the total genome of all BoCV isolates examined in this study. These gaps were easily filled by either resequencing the library or by PCR amplicon sequencing of selected regions. Routinely, there was sufficient double-stranded DNA to be included in a second pooled library if additional sequence data was necessary. In addition to sequencing archived viruses, this protocol can readily be applied to diagnostic applications. With modifications of the sample preparation, most clinical samples submitted to diagnostic laboratories can be used for analysis. One difference in a diagnostic application is that complete genome assembly would not be necessary but detection of specific viral sequences would be indicative of the presence of the virus. This would require, at least initially, de novo assembly and BLAST analysis to determine if viral sequences were present. Preliminary studies showed that viruses can be successfully detected, and in some cases, near full-length genomic sequences assembled, from serum and fecal samples (data not shown). Additionally, with minor modification of the initial double-stranded cDNA synthesis step, both dsRNA and DNA viruses can be sequenced.@story_separate@A deep sequencing method for rapid determination of genomic sequences of multiple viruses simultaneously is described. The practical application of this protocol was demonstrated by the generation of full-length or near full length genomic sequences of archived pestivirus and coronavirus isolates. With minor modifications, this protocol could be used to sequence multiple dsRNA and DNA viruses. This procedure is sequence independent, requiring no previous knowledge of sequence or pathogens present in a sample. Additionally, this shows promise for the rapid identification of multiple viral pathogens in diagnostic settings and comparison of viruses currently in circulation with those in vaccines.","Comparing sequences of archived viruses collected over many years to the present allows the study of viral evolution and contributes to the design of new vaccines. However, the difficulty, time and expense of generating full-length sequences individually from each archived sample have hampered these studies. Next generation sequencing technologies have been utilized for analysis of clinical and environmental samples to identify viral pathogens that may be present. This has led to the discovery of many new, uncharacterized viruses from a number of viral families. Use of these sequencing technologies would be advantageous in examining viral evolution. In this study, a sequencing procedure was used to sequence simultaneously and rapidly multiple archived samples using a single standard protocol. This procedure utilized primers composed of 20 bases of known sequence with 8 random bases at the 3′-end that also served as an identifying barcode that allowed the differentiation each viral library following pooling and sequencing. This conferred sequence independence by random priming both first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Viral stocks were treated with a nuclease cocktail to reduce the presence of host nucleic acids. Viral RNA was extracted, followed by single tube random-primed double-stranded cDNA synthesis. The resultant cDNAs were amplified by primer-specific PCR, pooled, size fractionated and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM platform. The individual virus genomes were readily assembled by both de novo and template-assisted assembly methods. This procedure consistently resulted in near full length, if not full-length, genomic sequences and was used to sequence multiple bovine pestivirus and coronavirus isolates simultaneously."
"On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed that a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had been identified in the city of Wuhan in China (World Health Organization, 2020a) . It soon became apparent that a coronavirus -which causes respiratory illness in human beings -was likely to be implicated. Within a few weeks, cases of human-to-human transmission were increasing exponentially within and across borders. At the end of January 2020, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) pursuant to the the Bill, it was clear the UK government was seeking a wide range of legal powers to manage the lockdown measures, as well as to address a myriad of issues that had arisen in relation to responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. With this in mind, the decision was taken to replace the initial Health Protection Regulations passed in February, which had drawn on health protection powers available under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 (UK Public General Acts 1984 c. 22) . Instead, the preferred way forward now was bespoke primary legislation. It was argued that this approach would provide the UK government and the devolved administrations with greater flexibility and a wider range of regulatory options to respond to the pandemic, as well as enabling the UK Parliament to undertake more detailed scrutiny of the use of government powers 'in the round' (Institute for Government, 2020b) . The purpose of the legislation was 'to respond to an emergency situation and manage the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic', given that it was likely to lead to a 'reduced workforce, increased pressure on health services and death management processes'. In doing so, the aims were to increase the health and social care workforce; to ease the burden on frontline staff in health and other public bodies; to contain and slow the spread of the virus; and to manage the deceased in a respectful and dignified manner (UK Parliament, 2020b) . In drafting the legislation, the decision had also been taken that there would be a UK-wide approach, save where specific measures were required in the devolved administrations. Following a short period of scrutiny by both Houses, the Bill was quickly passed by the UK Parliament in the face of minimal opposition. The Coronavirus Act 2020 (Coronavirus Act) received Royal Assent on 25 March 2020. The Act is due to expire two years from this date, subject to a limited number of exceptions. In contrast to other emergency legislation such as the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, the Act's parliamentary review mechanisms are more limited and spread over an extended period. They involve bi-monthly government reporting, in addition to the UK Parliament being able to express its views (at six months) or vote (at twelve months) on whether the Act should remain in force (UK Public General Acts 2004, c. 36 ; UK Public General Acts 2020, c 7, ss 89 & 90).@story_separate@Health is a devolved matter to Northern Ireland under constitutional arrangements in the UK. Therefore, it is ordinarily a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly to make policy and law in the area (Northern Ireland Act 1998 , UK Public General Acts 1998 . Given the need for a UK-wide approach, the Assembly adopted a consent motion to permit legal measures for managing the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Ireland to be included in the Coronavirus Act (Northern Ireland Assembly, 2020a) . Given the urgency of the situation, there was little opportunity for the Assembly to engage in detailed scrutiny of the Coronavirus Bill before it was passed by the UK Parliament and the Act came into force (Walker, & Butler, 2020; Northern Ireland Assembly, 2020b) . Once the Act was in force, the Northern Ireland government quickly moved to adopt its own Health Protection Regulations, which set out the approach to be taken to lockdown measures locally. They were brought into force at 11pm on 28 March 2020 (The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020, NI SR 2020 No. 55) . Specific measures contained in the Health Protection Regulations include powers to enforce the closure of schools and businesses, restrictions on people's movement without 'reasonable excuse' and enforcement powers for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (ss 5(1) & (2)). These Regulations are required to be reviewed by the Northern Ireland Department of Health every twenty -one days to determine whether the measures should remain in place. While regular reviews continue to take place (McCormack, 2020a) , the Northern Ireland Executive has also published its plan for exiting lockdown, outlining its principled and incremental approach to easing the restrictive measures imposed through the Regulations. In doing so, the Executive reaffirmed its commitment to North-South, as well as East-West, co-operation in managing the pandemic (Northern Ireland Executive, 2020; Northern Ireland Direct Government Services, 2020). The article focuses on examining the changes made to mental health and capacity laws in Northern Ireland through section 10 and Schedules 10 and 11 of the Coronavirus Act (emergency legislation). We proceed by providing a brief overview of such laws, before going on to explore the policy rationale for such changes, as well as elaborating on how key aspects are likely to be operationalised J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in practice. We also consider how these changes may potentially impact upon existing human rights protections for persons assessed as lacking mental capacity in Northern Ireland. In undertaking this examination, we acknowledge that it is necessarily at a preliminary stage given the recent implementation of such legislative changes. A more detailed critical analysis of their impact and consequences can only be made following the end of the public health e mergency. With this caveat in mind, we argue that it is important that regular parliamentary oversight is maintained in relation to the potential impact and consequences of such changes during the period they are in force. This should be done in order to assess whether they remain a necessary, proportionate and least restrictive response to the challenges faced in managing mental health and capacity issues in Northern Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this section, we first provide a brief overview of historical and political developments impacting upon constitutional arrangements and devolved powers in Northern Ireland. This will provide the necessary context in which to situate our examination of key aspects of Northern Ireland mental health and capacity laws. It will also set in contrast the changes introduced to such laws through emergency legislation, which are examined in more detail in the following sections of the article. Northern Ireland is a devolved nation of the UK comprising six counties in the North-East of the The MHO has been in force since 1986 and has been described as 'traditional mental health legislation' (Harper, Davidson, & McClelland, 2016 implementation and, once the Act is fully implemented, the MHO will be repealed. The MCANI is an innovative, ground-breaking piece of legislation both in the UK and internationally (Campbell, Brophy, Davidson, & O'Brien, 2018) . Northern Ireland has opted for a form of 'fusion legislation', bringing together capacity and mental health law across medical specialities (see Dawson, & Szmukler, 2006) . What this means is that impairment of decision-making capacity and best interests are the only criteria to be used when making decisions across health and social care (Lynch, Taggart, & Campbell, 2017) . At the heart of this reform of mental health and capacity laws is a recognition of both the moral and legal importance of a person's autonomy and rights. It applies in all circumstances where a person's autonomy might be compromised on health grounds. It acknowledges the importance of recognising 'parity of esteem' between mental and physical illness. The aim is to treat mental and physical illness equally under the law, with the objective of reducing stigma associated with separate mental health legislation. Notwithstanding this innovative rights-based approach to fusing mental health and capacity laws in & Flynn, 2016; Donnelly, 2016; Flynn, 2013; Harper, Davidson, & McClelland, 2016; McSherry, & Wilson, 2015; Series, 2015; Stavert, 2018; Szmukler, Daw, & Callard, 2014) . The first phase of the MCANI implementation programme was commenced on 2 December 2019. capacity is to be presumed and the burden of proof (balance of probabilities) is on those seeking to assert incapacity to show otherwise and on the basis of reasonable belief, taking account of the factors noted below. The test for capacity is whether or not a person aged 16 years or over is unable to make a decision for themselves because of 'an impairment of, or disturbance in the function of the mind or brain', whether temporary or permanent and whatever its origin (MCANI, s 3(1) & (2)(a)). A determination of incapacity is time and decision specific (MCANI, s 3(1)), and any intervention must be taken on a best interests basis (MCANI, ss 2 & 7; DoLS Code of Practice, Chapter 7). Factors to be taken into account in determining whether a person has the capacity are based on a functional assessment which includes their ability to understand, use, weigh and appreciate, communicate and retain the information relevant, or required, to (the process of) making the decision in question (see MCANI, s 4, DoLS Code of Practice, Chapter 5). The statutory principles set out in the MCANI underpin the operation of the DoLS scheme (MCANI, ss 1 & 2). In line with such principles, the DoLS Code of Practice makes clear that if a person is assessed as lacking capacity to make a decision, they should nevertheless be included as far as possible in any discussions about deprivation of liberty and to be able to make their views and opinions known. They are entitled to know, and be given, all the information, used in any assessments. No assumptions can be made about a person and they have the right to make unwise decisions. As far as is possible, they must be supported to make any decision regarding their care and treatment  The Trusts form part of the Northern Ireland health service known as Health and Social Care, which is equivalent to the National Health Service in England, Wales and Scotland (Health and Social Care Online, 2020). To be properly constituted under the DoLS scheme, the panel must consist of members appointed by the relevant Trust comprising three 'suitably qualified persons': one medical practitioner, one approved social worker and one other healthcare professional, who could be a registered nurse or midwife, registered dentist, occupational therapist, speech and language therapist, practitioner psychologist. In addition, panel members must have undertaken the requisite training in making formal assessments of capacity under the MCANI, as well as specific training for sitting on these panels (DoLS Regulations, Reg 2; DoLS Code of Practice, paras 14.4-14.5). We recognise that the DoLS scheme which operates in England and Wales has attracted significant criticism to date (Bartlett, 2014; Fanning, 2016; Law Commission, 2017; UK Parliament, 2018) , and will shortly be replaced with the Liberty Protection Safeguards Scheme (see Mental Capacity can now making formal assessments of capacity; the role and functions of the nominated person; how applications are now to be made for DoLS authorisations; the composition and methods of decision-making by Trust panels making DoLS authorisations; and the appeal mechanisms to the Review Tribunal. We now turn to consider these changes in more detail in the follo wing sections of the article. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f means 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)' (s 25A (2)). Regulations which would seek to enable these special restrictions or requirements would need to be proportionate and in response to an imminent threat to public health, which could include making provision for persons with coronavirus to be detained, quarantined or otherwise kept in isolation for the protection of the public health in specified circumstances (s 25D). It is also emphasised in both Emergency Codes of Practice that the usual 'legal processes' which apply in the case of use of the MHO and the MCANI, should continue to be used in the first instance. Making use of the emergency provisions should be seen as a matter of last resort, in circumstances where there is no other option (e.g. MCANI Emergency Code of Practice, para 6). To the authors' knowledge, there has been little use made of these provisions to date. We do recognise that there are, or will be, circumstances where the use of the emergency provisions might be justified, particularly where, for example, a significant COVID-19 outbreak occurs in a closed mental health J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f unit, resulting in a substantial depletion of the available psychiatric care workforce (Campbell, & Grierson, 2020  In the context of healthcare staff numbers being low due to sickness or isolation, the emergency  The (8)). During this period the patient can appeal their detention to the Review Tribunal. This assessment period has now been extended to twenty-eight days (MHO Emergency Code of Practice, para 34). By extending the assessment time limit there could be a delay to an appeal before the Review Tribunal and the implication is that a patient could be detained for longer than is necessary. This again raises the prospect of a potential interference of the patient's human rights on the grounds noted previously. It also begs the question as to whether these time extensions are actually required in the present circumstances. As there are already modifications addressing potential sickness in the workforce, which allow others to step into the roles usually performed by the approved social worker and responsible medical officer, it is not clear why any additional measures are required in order to ensure that the original statutory time limits are met. Individual Health and Social Care Trusts must monitor the use of emergency provisions on an individual basis and prepare a report on whether or not their use was appropriate in a given set of circumstances. This report is to be forwarded to the Northern Ireland Department of Health within fifty-six days following the end of the emergency period with temporary prescribed forms having been created to assist in this monitoring exercise (MHO Emergency Code of Practice, para 21; Annex A). There is also a requirement to inform the patient and the nearest relative that the emergency modifications are being used (MHO, Art 32; MHO Emergency Code of Practice , paras 19-21). While disclosure about the use of the provisions is to be welcomed in the interests of transparency, the question is whether this retrospective monitoring will be sufficiently robust, or even appropriate, in terms of dealing with an issue of this magnitude, namely, the compulsory detention and treatment of a patient. While there are few details provided as to how Trusts will monitor the use of the emergency provisions in practice, or justify their use, it will inevitably require additional w ork and perhaps more staff. This can hardly be the desired outcome, given the objective in introducing such provisions was in large part to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an already depleted workforce. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the approach taken by UK Courts and Tribunals has been to minimise risk to judges, Tribunal members, legal representatives and the parties (Courts and The above statement presumably refers to section 56 of the MCANI which sets out what constitutes an 'emergency'. This situation will arise if, at the time when the doctor making the report determines what would be in the person's best interests, that person (a) knows that the safeguard in that section is not met, but reasonably believes that to delay the report until that safeguard is met would involve an unacceptable risk of harm to the person; or (b) does not know whether the safeguard is met, but J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reasonably believes that to delay the report until it is established whether the safeguard is met, would involve an unacceptable risk of harm to the person. While this does not strictly represent a change to the existing law, its inclusion in the MCANI Emergency Code of Practice has the potential to be (over) relied upon during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it would lessen the burden on an already under-pressure workforce. This (over) reliance could, in turn, lead to a reduction in confidence in the ability of the MCANI, and the DoLS scheme, to provide safeguards and protect persons from arbitrary decision-making in line with Article 5 of the ECHR, notwithstanding claims to the contrary in the Emergency Code. Even prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of the DoLS Scheme has required a substantial change in working culture for many healthcare professionals in Northern Ireland. Indeed, it was recognised that training was needed to understand the nature, scope and practice of the new scheme. Training became a legal requirement for a range of healthcare professionals who would be working in the area (DoLS Regulations, Reg 2(3)). As noted previously, the DoLS Regulations provide that only 'suitably qualified persons' are to conduct formal assessments of capacity (see Reg 2(2)). However, one of the changes set out in the MCANI Emergency Code of Practice is the removal of the need for the 'suitably qualified person' making formal assessments of capacity, or participating in Trust panels, to have relevant training and experience in capacity (MCANI Emergency Code of Practice, para 47). This dispensing of training and the likelihood of minimal, if any, practical experience in working with the DoLS scheme on the part of healthcare professionals who may now be called upon to provide formal capacity assessments under the emergency provisions, raises the potential for incorre ct interpretation and application of the DoLS Regulations, and the MCANI more generally. The composition of Trust panels which determine DoLS authorisations has now been changed under the emergency provisions. As noted previously, the panels are usually constituted under the DoLS  As with the MHO Emergency Code of Practice, there is also a requirement for individual Trusts to monitor the use of the MCANI Emergency Code of Practice and to report to the Northern Ireland Department of Health no later than three months following the end of the period of emergency (MCANI Emergency Code of Practice, para 24). As noted previously, concerns about exactly how this monitoring will take place in the case of the MHO Emergency Code of Practice are also mirrored with respect to the MCANI Emergency Code. Since 2 December 2019, the Review Tribunal has also been empowered to review DoLS authorisations and applications for the appointment or removal of nominated persons under the MCANI. As noted previously, the Tribunal is currently conducting remote hearings and there are similar concerns about how such hearings will work in the context of considering applications for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f DoLS authorisations. Arguably, matters coming before the Tribunal during the COVID-19 pandemic might be more serious than has been the case to date, particularly where existing safeguards in relation to such applications have been relaxed under the MCANI Emergency Code of Practice. This begs the question as to whether remote hearings will always be appropriate in the circumstances. The changes made to Northern Ireland mental health and capacity laws under emergency legislation reflect the fact that the UK government, as well as the devolved administrations, are confronting an unprecedented public health emergency. This has necessitated the implementation of a range of legal measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to minimise the spread of the disease to the population. Notwithstanding the importance of mounting an appropriate legal response in the circumstances, it is also vital that human rights protections are adhered to, particularly given the level of restrictions that have been imposed on the UK population through the legislation. As has been forcefully argued by Michelle Bachelet, the United Nation's High Commissioner for Human Lockdowns, quarantines and other such measures to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19 should always be carried out in strict accordance with human rights standards and in a way that is necessary and proportionate to the evaluated risk … COVID-19 is a test for our societies, and we are all learning and adapting as we respond to the virus. Human dignity and rights need to be front and centre in that effort, not an afterthought (United Nations, 2020). It is important to note that the UK government has not derogated from its human rights obligations Committee on Human Rights identifying that Articles 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the ECHR were potentially engaged as a result of the changes to be made to Northern Ireland mental health and capacity laws. After a rather cursory analysis, the Department concluded that the changes did not infringe such rights but were instead 'sensible and pragmatic precautions' in circumstances where the legislation, when enacted, would not 'fundamentally reduce the important level of scrutiny that is given where deprivation of liberty is under consideration' (UK Department of Health and Social Care 2020a, para 25). In a subsequent summary impact assessment submitted to the UK Parliament, the Department nevertheless recognised that the changes to Northern Ireland mental health and capacity laws would involve a reduction in the 'protections for persons deprived of liberty' and this 'always carries the risk of negative reaction. However, considering the current position, it is not unlikely that the public reaction will be mostly positive. The move is widely supported across the HSC [Health and Social Care]' (UK Department of Health and Social Care, 2020b, para 73). We find this to be a troubling assertion to make, in the absence of evidence of public support for a reduction in such protections. It also represents a challenge to the democratic legitimacy of these changes, given the extended public consultation and parliamentary review processes that were undertaken in the drafting of the MCANI, which was underpinned by a rights-based approach to ensure appropriate protections were in place for those assessed as lacking mental capacity in Northern Ireland. Notwithstanding the UK government's position, academic and stakeholder concerns have been raised about the potential reach of the emergency legislation, and its potential impact upon human rights protections. Ruck Keene (2020) has argued that the overall 'bare bones' approach of the UK government with respect to ensuring the Coronavirus Act's compatibility with the ECHR means that the options for persons with impaired decision-making capacity have in effect been 'dramatically reduced' in the UK. Specifically, in relation to the changes made to detention powers under Northern Ireland mental health and capacity laws, the British Institute of Human Rights has argued that they have the potential to adversely impact upon an already vulnerable group, operating to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reduce existing safeguards, which will likely take place in the absence of suitable support mechanisms and sufficiently robust review processes. It remains unconvinced by the blanket assertions by the UK government to the effect that the changes to detention powers are unlikely to interfere with a person's human rights under Articles 3, 5 and 8 of the ECHR, given evidence to the contrary arising from poor treatment and outcomes for those with mental illness in the UK prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic (British Institute of Human Rights, 2020, 8). The Institute has also argued that the potential for a breach of Article 14 (protection against discrimination) should have been taken into account by the UK government in considering the impact of the emergency legislation upon vulnerable groups, which includes those assessed as lacking capacity. This is an important consideration in the Northern Ireland context, given the fact ECHR 1650). However, Article 8 is a qualified right and an exception also applies where it can be established that the alleged interference was for the 'protection of health' (Article 8(2)). While we have considered how the DoLS scheme applies in the context of the hospital setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, how might this apply in the case of DoLS authorisations outside such setting, such as for residents in nursing and residential care homes? It is a particularly pressing question at the current time, given evidence that care homes across the UK have become 'hotspots' for the spread of COVID-19 (Booth, 2020; Coker, 2020) . This has proved to be particularly problematic in the Northern Ireland context, with well over half of all COVID-19 deaths in the first wave of the pandemic occurring in such settings (McCormack, 2020b) . In relation to the risk posed by COVID-19 in Northern Ireland care homes, we focus solely on DoLS authorisation for present purposes, rather than any other potential legal issues that might arise in relation to potential civil or criminal liability, or non-compliance with quality assurance requirements (RQIA (Northern Ireland), 2020; Erwin, 2020). In focusing on this particular issue, it would be important to take account of both patients lacking capacity who have been discharged from a hospital to what is known as a 'step-down' facility, such as a care home, and those persons lacking capacity who are already resident in such facilities. In the first case, the initial rationale for the hospital discharge may have been that the person was likely to be at much less risk of contracting COVID-19, in addition to the fact that the discharge was likely to create additional bed capacity for those suffering from COVID-19 who require hospital admission (Propper, Stoye, & Zaranko, 2020) . Whilst an inpatient, the person would most likely to have been subject to a DoLS authorisation on the basis of a best interests assessment that they did not have capacity to recognise their current care needs. However, in the event of a transfer to a care home, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f there would be an urgent need to revisit the DoLS authorisation for that person in order to establish whether suitable safeguards were in place, including those addressing the risk of COVID-19 infection. In relation to persons lacking capacity already resident in Northern Ireland care homes, many are elderly which is a recognised high-risk group for contracting COVID-19. As discussed previously, the relative infancy of the DoLS scheme means that it may be the case that some such residents do not as yet have the relevant DoLS authorisation in place. Where this is the case, it could lead to a prima facie assertion that care homes would be in breach of the MCANI and the DoLS Regulations. However, care homes could seek to rely upon MCANI emergency provisions providing protection from liability, even if additional safeguards have not been met in the particular circumstan ces. This would be on the grounds that all reasonable steps had been taken to put such safeguards in place. Persons in charge of care homes where the person has been deprived of their liberty would need to be able to establish that they have a reasonable belief that the person lacks capacity, that it is in their best interests to deprive them of their liberty, and that the prevention of serious harm condition has been met (MCANI, ss 9-11, 65-67; DoLS Code of Practice 2019, Chapters 4, 7 (paras 7.17-7.20), 10). Where this has been satisfied, then the deprivation of liberty could be treated as authorised, even if this had not as yet been formally authorised by a Trust panel, although it would be expected that an application for DoLS application would be made as soon as possible. As highlighted previously, it would be important to reach this decision on a case -by-case basis involving an individual resident's circumstances, rather than those in charge of care homes using this as a general approach for not putting safeguards in place to manage the risk posed to residents from Both cases were decided in the absence of COVID-19 testing being available to residents in the care homes in question at the time, so the Court of Protection was unable to reach a conclusion as the extent of the risk posed to the residents, as well as to those caring for them. Notwithstanding a call by the Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister for universal testing to be instituted in care homes in early May, it appears that it will take until the end of June 2020 for this to be completed (BBC News 2020b; 2020c). This stands in stark contrast to the position in Ireland, for example, where all such testing had been completed by May 2020 (McMahon, 2020). As highlighted previously, the reported death rate in care homes has been an escalating problem, which suggests that residents in such facilities might bear the brunt of the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Ireland. Without further pro-active intervention, it raises serious concerns about the extent to which 'public J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f @story_separate@During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Ireland, hundreds of people have died from the disease with residents in care homes being disproportionately represented in the overall death toll. It is to be hoped that the combination of an expanded COVID-19 community testing programme, and the implementation of a contact tracing strategy, will now result in a better understanding of the nature and extent of the spread of the disease in Northern Ireland (Northern Ireland Department of Health, 2020d). This will enable a more pro-active approach to be taken to controlling the spread of COVID-19 in the community, as well as anticipating subsequent waves, in the future. As noted previously, the Northern Ireland Executive has also now published its strategy for easing lockdown measures as well as its coronavirus recovery plan, setting out the guidelines that will inform its approach. Notwithstanding such plan, the need for caution remains given persisting uncertainty about the ongoing risk posed by COVID-19 to the Northern Ireland population. While an effective vaccine to inoculate the population against the virus would bring more certainty to the situation, it is unlikely that this will be forthcoming in the short to medium term (Thompson, 2020) . In the circumstances, the changes made to Northern Ireland mental health and capacity laws through emergency legislation look set to stay in place for the foreseeable future, and up to a Much of the legislative focus in responding to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Ireland has been on addressing concerns about health and social care workforce shortages and resources, as well as meeting hospital surge capacity. However, it is important that action taken by key decision-makers as a result of changes made under emergency legislation constitute a necessary, proportionate and least restrictive response in the circumstances. In this regard, the Northern Ireland Assembly, as well as its specialist committees, the Committee for Health and the Ad Hoc Committee on the COVID-19 Response, have an important role to play. The MCANI is in the early stages of implementation with the majority of the provisions yet to come into force. It will therefore be some time before the long-nurtured vision of an innovative, internationally leading piece of legislation, which fuses both capacity and mental health law across all medical specialities in health and social care, is fully operational. With the world watching, it is important that political leaders in Northern Ireland provide sufficient financial support and resources to allow for the realisation of this vision. This is in addition to ensuring that the changes made to mental health and capacity laws through emergency legislation to address the COVID-19 pandemic are only in place for as long as is absolutely necessary and that adequate human rights protections remain in place during this period for those assessed as lacking capacity in Northern Ireland.","This article examines the changes made to mental health and capacity laws in Northern Ireland through temporary emergency legislation, known as the Coronavirus Act 2020. The purpose of the legislation was to respond to the emergency situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular the increase pressure placed on health services in the United Kingdom. An overview is provided of the government's rationale for the changes to Northern Ireland mental health and capacity laws, as well as exploring how they are likely to be operationalised in practice. Consideration is also given as to how such changes may impact upon existing human rights protections for persons assessed as lacking mental capacity. It is argued that it is important that regular parliamentary oversight is maintained in relation to the potential impact and consequences of such changes during the period they are in force. This should be done in order to assess whether they remain a necessary, proportionate and least restrictive response to the challenges faced in managing mental health and capacity issues in Northern Ireland during this public health emergency."
"The global effort to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus and to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic is an interdisciplinary endeavor with an intensity the world has rarely seen (Apuzzo and Kirkpatrick 2020). Scientists from many areas, ranging from microbiology to AI, are working to understand the disease, adding to a rapidly expanding body of literature which encompasses both past work on viruses and findings on the novel coronavirus (Wang et al. 2020b) . As a recent example, a diverse group of scientists called attention to the airborne transmissibility of the virus based on research spanning virology, aerosol physics, flow dynamics, epidemiol-@story_separate@The virus binds to target cells by use of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. There are few studies about face mask detection based on image analysis. Severe perioperative complications may occur during general anesthesia in infants. ogy, medicine and building engineering, stating, ""expertise in many science and engineering areas enables us to understand the mechanisms behind generation of respiratory microdroplets, how viruses survive in microdroplets, and how airflow patterns carry microdroplets in buildings"" (Queensland University of Technology 2020). In this paper, our overarching goal is to build a knowledge base (KB) that scientists can use to search and explore diverse interdisciplinary mechanisms in literature related to COVID-19. Figure 1 shows examples of the types of mechanisms we focus on. These include mentions of mechanistic activities (e.g., viral binding), of functions that natural or artificial entities serve (e.g., a protein used for binding, or image analysis used in public health), and also more indirect influences and associations (such as possible complications associated with a medical procedure). These relationships cover a wide range of domain-specific concepts in scientific papers, providing a unified language which can be used for domainagnostic extraction and scientific search (with results as seen in Figure 1 ). More broadly, a KB of mechanisms across science could enable the transfer of ideas across disparate areas (Hope et al. 2017; Kittur et al. 2019) , and assist in literature-based discovery (Swanson and Smalheiser 1996; Spangler et al. 2014; Nordon et al. 2019) by finding crossdocument causal links (Swanson and Smalheiser 1996) . In biomedicine, information extraction (IE) has been used to extract mentions of pinpointed entities such as proteins or chemicals and their relations, including recently from coronavirus-related papers (Ilievski et al. 2020; Ahamed and Samad 2020; Hope et al. 2020) . Some of these relations correspond to mechanisms (e.g., chemical-protein regulation, or drug-drug interactions), but capture only a fraction of the full breadth and depth of mechanisms in the literature. It is challenging to formulate comprehensive fine-grained schemas for diverse domains; on the other extreme, Open IE approaches (Etzioni et al. 2008; Stanovsky et al. 2018 ; Zhan and Zhao 2020) focus on general-purpose, schemafree extraction of relations, but many of the relations are generic and uninformative for scientific applications In this work, we use open, free-form entities with a broad class of relations centered around mechanisms, to strike a balance between expressivity and breadth. Our unified view of mechanisms is designed to help generalize and scale the study of these important relations in the context of the COVID-19 emergency and more broadly. We lay the foundations for the framework, which we hope will open new avenues for boosting knowledge discovery across the sciences. Our main contributions include: • We curate and distribute an annotated dataset of mechanisms in COVID-19 papers to help accelerate discovery of functional relations and research in this area. We release a state-of-art IE model (Wadden et al. 2019) trained on our data, and a knowledge base of 2M mechanism relations extracted from the literature. These relations include direct mechanisms (mentions of mechanistic activities and functions) and indirect mechanisms (influences and associations without explicit mention of the process involved). • We show 2X improvement in F1 over baselines including a recent scientific IE approach , Open IE, and semantic role labeling (SRL (Shi and Lin 2019) ). These results demonstrate the inability of existing approaches to capture an important class of relations and the utility of our curated dataset. • In experiments with human evaluators, we reach high precision in two search tasks using our KB: studying mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and exploring applications of AI in the CORD-19 corpus. The concept of mechanisms, also referred to as functional relations, is fundamental in biomedical ontologies (Burek et al. 2006; Röhl 2012; Keeling et al. 2019) , engineering (Hirtz et al. 2002) , and across science. Mechanisms can be natural (e.g., the mechanism by which amylase in saliva breaks down starch into sugar), artificial (electronic devices), non-physical constructs (algorithms, economic policies), and very often a blend (a pacemaker regulating the beating of a heart through electricity and AI algorithms). In our work we aim to achieve broad coverage of mechanism relations, extending to a wide range of entities and topics observed in COVID-19 papers. For example, in addition to areas such as medicine, microbiology, genetics, proteomics, zoology and virology, topics we cover in our mechanism annotations include computer science, public policies, flow dynamics, building engineering, macroeconomic impacts and international relations. In Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (Harari 2016), the author writes: ""While some experts are familiar with one field, such as AI, nanotechnology, big data or genetics [...] no one is capable of connecting all the dots and seeing [...] how breakthroughs in AI might impact nanotechnology, or vice versa."" By building a KB with diverse, domain-agnostic mechanisms, we aim to make progress toward connecting those dots. Exact definitions of mechanisms are subject to debate in the philosophy of science (Röhl 2012; Keeling et al. 2019) . A dictionary definition of mechanisms refers to a natural or established process by which something takes place or is brought about. More intricate definitions discuss ""complex systems producing a behavior"", ""entities and activities productive of regular changes"", ""a structure performing a function in virtue of its parts and operations"", or the distinction between ""correlative property changes"" and ""activity determining how a correlative change is achieved"" (Röhl 2012) . The schema we propose in this work (see Section 3, Figures 1,2) draws inspiration from these existing definitions. We extract activities and functions, and also more general influences and associations. Our work is also related to a large body of literature on extracting information from biomedical papers. This information often corresponds to very specific types of mechanisms such as chemical-protein regulation and drug-drug interactions (Li et al. 2016; Segura Bedmar, Martínez, and Herrero Zazo 2013) . In the CHEMPROT dataset (Li et al. 2016) for example, texts are annotated for relations capturing interactions between chemicals and proteins (e.g., up/down regulation). The annotation guidelines for CHEMPROT distinguish between direct and indirect interactions, between relations explicitly and implicitly referred to in the text, and between texts where ""mechanistic information is available"" and those where the nature of an interaction is more vague. A semantic predication schema akin to Semantic Role Labeling, with predicates such as X treats Y or X induces Y, has also been proposed (Kilicoglu et al. 2011) . Concepts and relations in that work were also limited to a relatively narrow set of biomedical sub-domains and entities aligned with the UMLS biomedical onotolgy (Bodenreider 2004 ) such as names of drugs and diseases (see Section 5.1 for more details). Recent work has applied such tools to extract information from the CORD-19 corpus, for constructing KBs (Wise et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020a) and visualizations (Hope et al. 2020) . Unfortunately, biomedical ontologies suffer from cultural differences between disciplines that lead to a lack of a unified language (Wang et al. 2018) and many fragmented classes (Salvadores et al. 2013 ) -with only a small a fraction at the focus of mainstream biomedical IE. In the next section, we present our schema for unified extraction of mechanisms -in biomedicine, and beyond. Our goal is to extract information expressing the important notion of mechanisms. As discussed in Section 2, this seemingly intuitive concept is subject to debate, and an absolute definition is illusive. We opt for a practical approach that is simple enough for annotators and models, inspired by the definitions and schema discussed in Section 2. Within the concept of mechanisms, we include activities (e.g., binding) or explicit mentions of functions (e.g., a use for treating), and also influences or associations of a more indirect nature (such as describing observed effects, without describing the process involved). We further break the concept of mechanisms into relations of the form ( subject, object, class) with two coarse-grained classes. The first, which we call direct mechanisms, includes mechanistic activities, and reference to specific functions. The second, indirect mechanisms, includes influences or associations without explicit mechanistic information or mention of a function, and relations that are expressed more implicitly in the text. Indirect mechanisms correspond to texts indicating ""input-output correlations"" (Röhl 2012) , such as indicating that COVID-19 may lead to certain symptoms but not how, or mentioning a general association between two proteins. Direct mechanisms describe ""inner workings"" -revealing more of the intermediate states that lead from initial conditions (COVID-19) to final states (symptoms) (Röhl 2012) , or describing explicitly the function served by an entity (whether natural or human-made). This distinction is inspired by the direct and indirect types of relations in the CHEMPROT chemical-protein regulation schema, but covers a much broader set of concepts and domains. Figure 1 shows some examples, such as SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells (direct mechanism), the use of image analysis for face mask detection (direct mechanism), and complications generally associated with a medical procedure (indirect mechanism). Our annotation guideline, available in the supplement, shows many more instantiations of these relations. Finally, to be able to more directly interpret mechanism relations beyond the coarse-grained categorization, we also experimented with granular relations of the form subject-predicate-object, where predicates represent a specific type of a mechanism relation explicitly mentioned in the text (e.g., binds, causes, reduces; see Figure 2) . While more granular, these relations are also less general -as the natural language of scientific papers describing mechanisms often does not conform to this more rigid structure (in Table 1 , there are 400 coarse relations that could not be converted to granular form by an annotator). In our experiments, we also train a model that infers the predicates (a list of frequent predicates is available in the supplement). We construct a dataset (called COFIE: COVID-19 Open over 200K abstracts and papers relating to past and present coronaviruses and other broadly related literature. We collect 250 abstracts, similar in size to related scientific IE datasets ) which share similar challenges in collecting expert annotations of complex or ambiguous concepts. We use a relatively low-resource, generalizable annotation approach for a rapid response to COVID-19. Annotation process To obtain high-quality annotations of CORD-19 abstracts, we follow a three-stage process of (1) annotating entities and relations using biomedical experts, (2) unifying span boundaries with an NLP expert, and (3) verifying annotations with a bio-NLP expert. In the first stage, 5 annotators with biomedical background annotate all relations reflecting mechanisms as defined in Section 3.1 (the full annotation guidelines can be found in the supplement). Annotators were given examples and had a one-hour training session using Prodigy, a platform with a GUI for rapid annotations (Montani and Honnibal 2018). Entities are annotated only when involved in a relation with another. Following ), annotators perform a greedy annotation preferring longer spans whenever ambiguity occurs as to span boundaries. We initially observed large variation between annotators and low agreement as measured with strict, exact matching criteria between relations. A deeper look revealed much of the disagreement was due to variations in annotation style rather than meaning. In particular, the largest reason for disagreement was differences in span boundaries, likely stemming from the challenging nature of our task with abstract, soft definitions of relations between free-form spans. In the second stage of annotation, an NLP expert annotator carried out a round of style unification between annotators to enhance dataset quality. The NLP expert unified entity annotations by adjusting span boundaries while preserving the original meaning. In the last stage, a bio-NLP expert with experience in annotating scientific papers verified the annotations and corrected them as needed. We observe that the bio-NLP expert accepted 81% of the annotations from the second stage without modification, confirming the high quality of the annotated data.  Given an input document D represented as a sequence of input tokens {w 1 , . . . , w n }, the task is to identify all mentions of mechanism relations in D -including the entities participating in those relations. Entities In COFIE, we only annotate entity mentions that participate in one of our two relation categories (direct/indirect). These mentions all share a single common entity type. The mention e = (e start , e end ) is represented by the indices of its start and end tokens in D. The s and o slots are the same as in coarse relations. p represents a specific type of mechanism relation (which may be direct or indirect). For simplicity, we constrain the predicate p to consist of a single token (usually a verb); p is therefore represented by its token index in D. We evaluate our performance in the tasks of entity identification and relation extraction, defined as follows. Entity identification Given a boolean span matching function m(s 1 , s 2 ) = 1(s 1 matches s 2 ), a predicted entity mentionê is correctly identified if there exists some gold mention e * in D such that m(ê, e * ) = 1 2 . We experiment with three different span matching functions. The most conservative is m exact , which is true if two spans have the same start and end tokens. Given the heterogeneous nature of the spans present in our dataset, this metric is overly stringent. Therefore, following common practice in work on Open IE (Stanovsky et al. 2018 ), we also report results using two more lenient matching functions. The similarity function m rouge (s 1 , s 2 ) is true if Rouge-L(s 1 , s 2 ) > 0.5 (Lin 2004) , and the function m subset (s 1 , s 2 ) true if s 1 is contained in s 2 or vice versa. Relation identification / classification Given a boolean span matching function, a predicted coarse-grained relation r = (ŝ,ô,ŷ) is correctly identified if there exists some gold relation r * = (s * , o * , y * ) in D such that m(ŝ, s * ) = 1 and m(ô, o * ) = 1. It is properly classified if, in addition, y = y * . Granular relations are evaluated in the same fashion 2 Since there is only one entity type in COFIE, an entity mention is correctly classified as long as its span is correctly identified. as coarse-grained relations, with the additional requirement that the predicted predicate tokenp must match the gold p * . Relation identification measures the model's ability to identify relations of any type -direct or indirect -while relation classification aims to discriminate between direct and indirect types of mechanism mentions in the text. Our goal is to build a KB that can be used by scientists to explore relevant literature in a structured manner, supporting search for relations with queries that target specific mechanism relations, as well as more flexible, soft exploration tasks. We train the state-of-the-art DYGIE (Wadden et al. 2019) relation extraction model on our COFIE dataset. Using the trained model, we construct a rich knowledge base to help scientists explore mechanism relations extracted from across many scientific papers. Our approach for constructing a KB consists of the following steps. 1. Extraction. We apply our model to approximately 160K abstracts in the CORD-19 corpus, extracting over 2M relations -1.4M direct mechanism relations, and 630K indirect mechanisms. We select a subset of high confidence relations (with softmax score ≥ 90%) and perform standard data cleaning, yielding a KB of 1.5M relations. 2. Semantic similarity. Our KB consists of diverse, open spans of text -over 900K unique surface forms after standard string normalization (such as removing punctuation, lemmatizing and lowercasing). In order to support search over our KB, we adapt a recent biomedical language model (LM) trained on over 2.5M papers in PubMed (Gururangan et al. 2020) by fine-tuning it on semantic similarity tasks with the approach in (Reimers and Gurevych 2019) -we fine-tune the LM on the semantic textual similarity (STS) and Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) (Bowman et al. 2015) datasets, to capture a broad notion of similarity. We further tune the LM on the BIOSSES (Sogancıoglu,Öztürk, andÖzgür 2017) dataset, with 100 sentence pairs from biomedical papers annotated for similarity. This approach allows us to capture related concepts (such as cardiac injury and cardiovascular morbidity), as well as simpler surface matches. 3. Approximate nearest neighbors search. Finally, to perform search over this KB in an efficient manner, we employ a recent system (Johnson, Douze, and Jégou 2017) designed for fast similarity-based search over vectors (such as our text embeddings). We create an index of embeddings corresponding to the 900K unique surface forms. In our setting, queries consist of terms representing the subject and/or object of a relation. Queries are embedded using the same language model. Relations are retrieved within 2 seconds on a standard CPU-only laptop. We evaluate the extracted entities and relations on the three sub-tasks introduced in Section 3.4: relation classification, relation identification, and entity identification. Implementation Details We use the DYGIE library 3 , with SciBERT (Beltagy, Lo, and Cohan 2019) token embeddings finetuned on our task. We employ minimal random hyperparameter search to select the best-performing model on the development set. Full details and code are in the supplement. Baselines We compare our method with the baselines below. Some of these baselines involve training a model on an existing dataset. In these cases, we preprocess the dataset by ""mapping"" all relation types to the direct mechanism or indirect mechanism relations in COFIE. This mapping was performed by a bio-NLP expert annotator. SemRep. We train DYGIE on the SemRep dataset (Kilicoglu et al. 2011), consisting of 500 sentences from MEDLINE abstracts and annotated for semantic predication. Concepts and relations in this dataset relate to clinical medicine, substance interactions, genetic etiology of disease and pharmacogenomics. Concepts are tied to the UMLS biomedical ontology (Bodenreider 2004 ) and focused on pinpointed entities as in most biomedical IE resources. Some of the relations correspond to mechanisms (such as X TREATS Y or X CAUSES Y); other relations are even broader, such as PART-OF or IS-A -we do not attempt to capture these categories as they often do not reflect a functional relation. SciERC We train DYGIE on the SciERC dataset , consisting of 500 abstracts from computer science papers that are annotated for a set of relations, including for USED-FOR relations between methods and tasks. We naturally map this relation to our MECHANISM label and discard other relation types. SRL Our task consists of functional relations between open, flexible spans. A natural baseline to try is thus Semantic Role Labeleing (SRL). Using a pre-trained SRL model (Shi and Lin 2019) , we select relations of the form (Arg0, verb, Arg1), and evaluate using our partial metrics applied to Arg0 and Arg1 respectively. SRL-Bio predicates. We adapt the SRL baseline by filtering predicates down to a list of 80 biomedical verbs that are publicly available from a biomedical proposition bank named BioPro (Chou et al. 2006) . Continuing the above baseline, we task a biomedical annotator with mapping each predicate verb to either DIRECT MECHANISM or INDIRECT MECHANISM, using this mapping as SRL's predictions. OpenIE Finally, we also experiment with the supervised Open Information Extraction model of (Stanovsky et al. 2018) , similar in nature and in motivation to SRL. Table 2 reports the performance of the DYGIE model trained on COFIE and of the different baselines. Our model outperforms baselines by a factor of 2X Table 3 shows a comparison of precision, precision@K and recall of the DYGIE model trained on our data and on SciERC. The model trained on our data achieves 90% P@50, indicating that correct predictions are assigned higher confidence scores. Figure 3 (left) shows precision scores for top K predicted relations, sorted by prediction confidence. The DY-GIE model trained on COFIE maintains a high precision score (≥ 70%) within top-20% predictions. As discussed in Section 4, we construct a KB by filtering for high-confidence relations, thus having high P@K is important. In Figure 3 (right) we show the relation identification F 1 score for different thresholds of the Rouge-L matching metric. Our default threshold is 0.5. We conduct this analysis primarily to make sure results are reasonably robust in a local neighborhood around 0.5. As expected, we observe a steady decline in F1 as the threshold increases, however the curve declines moderately, and even with the most conservative threshold of 1.0 (i.e. an exact match) F1 is substantially higher than our best performing baseline (SciERC). Granular relation prediction In addition to coarse-grained relation prediction, we also train a model on COFIE-G and measure the prediction quality. Our evaluation shows that the model trained to predict (s, predicate, o) triples achieves F 1 scores of 43.2 and 24.4 using the substring and exact match metrics, respectively. When predicting relations without trigger labels (i.e., (s, o)), the model achieves F 1 scores of 51.7 and 27.6 on the same two metrics. To complement the automatic evaluation metrics in section 2, we conduct an additional human evaluation to measure the quality of the predictions in our KB -do automated metrics capture the true quality of predictions, or are they an under/overestimation as measured by human judgments? We employ two annotators with biomedical and computer science background, and show them predicted relations for sentences selected randomly from our test data so that we can compare to our automated metrics over ground truth annotation. In particular, we show each annotator 200 relations and the sentences from which they were extracted: 100 predicted by our approach (DYGIE trained on COFIE), and 100 using the pre-trained semantic role labeling (SRL) baseline in Section 2. Annotators are asked to evaluate relations in similar fashion to our annotation guidelines, tagging relations as positive if they reflect a mechanism described in the text, and if they consist of coherent argument spans that capture essential information for the relation to hold, but not redundant or irrelevant information. Table 4 shows a major increase in relation accuracy, as compared to results obtained with automated metrics. In particular we reach average positive rating of over 91%, a high figure in absolute terms, and more than double the rating of SRL (41.7%). Inter-rater agreement was high at 71 by Cohen's Kappa score and 73 by Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score. Interestingly, we observe that while in absolute numbers the gap between our human-evaluated accuracy and the partial metrics is high, there is strong correlation between them in the overall trend. In particular, accuracy as measured using the rouge-L score to match relations increases more than two-fold for our model in comparison to SRL (from 22.4 to 55.2). A similar trend is seen for the substring-inclusion measure (from 28.7 to 68.6). We conclude via human judgments that our predicted relations are of overall sufficiently high quality, and that our automated metrics correlate with human judgments. We show how our system can be used to search for mechanism relations across a KB of 2M functional relations, and evaluate its utility in two search applications: Studying the viral mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, and discovering medical applications of AI in the literature. Targeted biomedical search. This task involves searching for SARS-CoV-2 mechanism relations focused on a specific well-known statement or question regarding the virus (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 receptor to gain entry into cells). Table 4 : Human evaluation stats for our predictions vs. baseline SRL. We note that human evaluation scores are considerably higher than captured by our automated metrics wrt ground truth annotations, yet still correlated with them -indicating their usefulness in this challenging setting. In this scenario, we issue queries which specify both the subject and the object of a mechanism relation (e.g., for a given relation (s 1 = SARS-CoV-2, s 2 = binds ACE2 receptor), retrieve relations where s * 1 is relevant/similar to ""SARS-CoV-2"" and s * 2 relevant to ""binds ACE2 receptor""). This task is designed to test our framework's ability to support researchers looking to quickly generate a list of relations pertaining to a specific hypothesis. Open-ended cross-domain search. This task is focused on discovering diverse ways in which AI research areas or methods are applied in the CORD-19 corpus. Unlike the previous scenario, here evaluators are given queries where only the subject of the relation is specified, s 1 -with queries consisting of popular, leading subfields and methods within AI (e.g., deep reinforcement learning or text analysis). The aim of this task is to evaluate whether we can support exploratory search over relations, potentially surfacing inspirations for new applications of AI against COVID-19, or helping biomedical researchers and practitioners discover where AI methods are being used. Task Setup and Evaluation In both tasks, our goal is to see if we can retrieve relevant relations that expert annotators consider useful and correct. To evaluate these tasks, we re- Figure 4 : (Left) Precision vs. recall for the search tasks (viral mechanisms, AI methods).

In the AI task human labels were more diverse but with overall high precision / recall. cruit 7 annotators with graduate-level education in computer science (AI), medicine, biology and material science. Table 5 shows examples from the two tasks. In the search focusing on viral mechanisms, 10 claims written by a medical student regarding COVID-19 were taken from a collection of statements prepared in recent automated scientific claim-verification work (Wadden et al. 2020). For example, in Table 5 , one such statement regards an association (indirect mechanism) between cardiac injury and COVID-19. We formulate a query for indirect mechanism relations, shown in the second column of the table. In the second task focusing on exploring AI applications, we select a representative list of top methods and areas within AI. Task descriptions, queries and instructions are available in the supplement. For both tasks, given a query we retrieve the top 1000 most similar relations from our KB, requiring the cosine distance between the embeddings of each of s1 (subject) and s2 (object) and the query to be at least 0.75. For queries consisting of both s 1 and s 2 terms, we compute the average distances to their respective query terms, and then select the top and bottom 10 relations (20 per query, 200 per task, and 400 relations in total), shuffle their order, and present to anno-tators together with the original sentence from which each relation was extracted. We ask evaluators to rate whether the retrieved relations are relevant, as judged by the system's ability to identify (s1, s2) relations such that (1) they are relevant to the query, and (2) the sentence in which (s1, s2) are mentioned expresses a mechanism relation between the two terms, rather than incidentally mentioning them together. This is a challenging task, evaluating both retrieval of relations that are semantically similar to the query, and also accurate extraction of relations from sentences. In total, we collect 1700 relevance labels across both tasks. Results Figure 4 (left) shows our results for both tasks. We rank results by their similarity to the query as described, and measure precision and recall. We measure average pairwise annotator agreement with several metrics: accuracy (proportion of matching labels), F1 (taking into account precision and recall symmetrically), balanced accuracy (downweighting the positive ratings to counter their higher proportion), and the Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score. In the viral mechanisms task, we achieve high precision of 90% that remains stable for recall values as high as 70%. This reflects our experiment in which annotators viewed relations constrained to be highly or moderately similar to the query, and our ability to retrieve relevant relations. Agreement is relatively high by all metrics. In the AI applications task, our model achieves a precision of 85% at a recall of 40%, but drops more quickly. This is likely due to the more exploratory nature of the task, and the use of concepts from biomedicine and computer science with jargon subtleties not all annotators could precisely understand (e.g., network models vs. neural networks). Despite this challenge, overall agreement was high or moderate in the AI task too.@story_separate@In this paper we extract a knowledge base (KB) of mechanism and effect relations from papers relating to COVID-19. Our KB can help scientists search and explore relations spanning viral mechanisms of action, diagnostic algorithms, disease symptoms and many more. We release a dataset an-notated for mechanism relations, and an IE model trained on our data with an improvement in F1 of at least 2X over baselines. We demonstrate our system's use in searching for biological mechanisms employed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and for applications of AI methods in this domain. Our unified view of mechanisms can help generalize and scale the study of the virus and related areas of relevance in the fight against COVID-19. We hope our framework can support research on COVID-19, and boost scientific knowledge discovery more broadly.","The urgency of mitigating COVID-19 has spawned a large and diverse body of scientific literature that is challenging for researchers to navigate. This explosion of information has stimulated interest in automated tools to help identify useful knowledge. We have pursued the use of methods for extracting diverse forms of mechanism relations from the natural language of scientific papers. We seek to identify concepts in COVID-19 and related literature which represent activities, functions, associations and causal relations, ranging from cellular processes to economic impacts. We formulate a broad, coarse-grained schema targeting mechanism relations between open, free-form entities. Our approach strikes a balance between expressivity and breadth that supports generalization across diverse concepts. We curate a dataset of scientific papers annotated according to our novel schema. Using an information extraction model trained on this new corpus, we construct a knowledge base (KB) of 2M mechanism relations, which we make publicly available. Our model is able to extract relations at an F1 at least twice that of baselines such as open IE or related scientific IE systems. We conduct experiments examining the ability of our system to retrieve relevant information on viral mechanisms of action, and on applications of AI to COVID-19 research. In both cases, our system identifies relevant information from our automatically-constructed knowledge base with high precision."
"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), emerged from China and spread worldwide as pandemic. SARS-CoV2 infection is responsible for a heterogeneous clinical syndrome, leading to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), titled coronavirus disease 2019 . The occurrence of neurological manifestations, including encephalitis, stroke, headache, seizures, Guillain-Barrè syndrome, is increasingly reported in patients with COVID-19 [1] [2] [3] [4] . Although these neurological manifestations of COVID-19 suggest a possibly acute or subacute neuropathogenicity of the virus, the risk of longterm neurological sequelae in patients affected by SARS-CoV2 is not understood and currently debated [5, 6] . Available data on COVID-19 currently disclosed that SARS-CoV2 can induce, directly or indirectly, a number of clinical manifestations and immune-inflammatory events, including viral-host interactions, that might shape pathogenic mechanisms underlying common chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders [2, 5, 6] . Tommaso Schirinzi, Doriana Landi and Claudio Liguori have equally contributed to manuscript conceptualization and drafting, and equally serve as corresponding authors. In this review, we will specifically discuss the biological events possibly initiated by SARS-CoV2 infection potentially overlapping with etiological mechanisms featuring Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), or narcolepsy. Building on these evidences, we will highlight the need to monitor patients affected by COVID-19 who can develop PD, MS, or narcolepsy as long-term neurological consequences of the infection.@story_separate@PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by progressive motor and non-motor disturbances, due to the loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn)-positive Lewy bodies [7] [8] [9] . The relationship between viral infections and PD has its roots in the early twentieth century, when a number of post-encephalitic parkinsonism were observed following an influenza outbreak. Aside from this historical event, infectious diseases, including viral infections, have been demonstrated increasing the risk for PD by 20% [10] . The mechanisms underlying this association may imply a direct neuronal injury due to the central nervous system (CNS) invasion by viruses and subsequent loss of dopaminergic cells into the SNpc. Indeed, it has been recently demonstrated in Rag knockout mice that H1N1 Influenza-A virus infection inhibits protein degradation at autophagosome-lysosome system level and precipitates α-syn accumulation [11] . Further experimental evidence showed that Influenza-A virus disrupts mitochondrial activity and increase oxidative stress [12, 13] , whereas hepatitis C virus impairs dopaminergic transmission and affects the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity [10] . Therefore, viral infections may intervene in cellular pathways critical for PD pathogenesis, probably contributing to the initiation of the disease [8, 9, [14] [15] [16] [17] . Although the CNS colonization by SARS-CoV2 has been proven, the consequences on neurons at a molecular level have been only hypothesized [5, 6] . However, it is interesting to note that the virus may affect brain areas particularly involved in early phases of PD neurodegeneration. Many patients with COVID-19 indeed complained of anosmia and ageusia [18] , which are two classical prodromal features of PD [19] . Actually, SARS-CoV2 might invade the brain through the olfactory tracts and spread towards the piriform and infralimbic cortex, the basal ganglia and the brainstem [18] . Neuropathological evidence suggests that, in PD, Lewy body accumulation is primarily localized in the olfactory pathway, and then propagates to other brain structures following olfactory system connections causing neuronal degeneration [19, 20] . This potential overlap between the SARS-CoV2 propagation and the spreading of PD neuropathology is particularly alarming if we consider that some patients with COVID-19 do not recover (or partially recover) smell sense [18], thus, indicating a possible neuronal injury that in turn might trigger the synucleinopathy cascade [21] . Aside from the direct invasion of CNS, SARS-CoV2 might increase the risk for PD because of the induction of a systemic inflammatory state [22] . Cytokine production is fundamental in the immunological response to viruses. However, an excessive and dysregulated release of interferons (IFNs), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and chemokines (C-C motif chemokine ligand, CCL-2, CCL-3, and CCL-5), shaping the so-called cytokine storm, can be deleterious, causing an immune-mediated attack to human organs [23] . COVID-19 patients present a systemic inflammatory state, as demonstrated by the significant increase of C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-2R, and ferritin blood levels [24] . Similar profile of peripheral inflammation is notably observed in PD patients, who exhibit higher blood levels of CRP and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IL-1β and IL-2) [25, 26] , directly correlated with clinical severity [27] . The inflammatory activation due to COVID-19 may thus disrupt the systemic homeostasis at the CNS level, where it could trigger and feed initial steps of synucleinopathy, favouring PD onset, as compelling experimental evidence suggests [22, 28] . COVID-19 is also responsible for gastrointestinal symptoms [29] , and SARS-CoV2 RNA has been tracked in the faeces of infected patients indicating an intestinal localization of the virus. A recent study demonstrated that enterocytes represent major target cells of SARS-CoV2 reacting to the infection with a strong inflammatory response [30] . These findings might further highlight the role of COVID-19 as a potential risk factor for PD. In fact, an experimental intestinal infection was able to turn PINK1 asymptomatic mouse model into a fully penetrant model, with levodopa-responsive motor symptoms, probably trough an immune-mediated multisystem mechanism [31] . Moreover, SARS-CoV2 intestinal infection may alter gut microbiota and gut physiology overall [32] , influencing all factors providing the ""peripheral"" contribute to PD pathogenesis and progression [33] . Finally, it should be also considered psychiatric comorbidity of COVID-19. Actually, patients can develop depression, anxiety and fatigue, which may have both psychological and organic causes [34] . Regardless of the cause, mood disorders are associated with neuroinflammation and often exert detrimental effects on CNS, contributing to neurodegeneration [35] . Hence, COVID-19 definitely represents a stressful event that may have a role in triggering PD [36] . MS is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the CNS whose pathological hallmark is focal demyelination associated with various degrees of neurodegeneration [37] . Complex immunological dysfunction-involving peripheral T and B lymphocytes and resident CNS immune cells-represents the immunological substrate for MS development and progression [38] . The intermittent aberrant activation of self-reacting immune cell subsets results in their transmigration across the BBB into the CNS, where they induce demyelinating and, ultimately, neuronal damage manifesting as clinical relapse and disability accumulation. The aetiology of the disease, as well as its periodic relapses, is not established yet, but environmental triggers acting on susceptible individuals are implicated. For over a century, since Pierre Marie initial intuition in 1884, MS was believed to be caused by infectious agents and many viruses, including coronavirus, have been proposed as potential candidates [39] . Viral infection contributes to demyelination through several mechanisms such as molecular mimicry, bystander inflammatory damage or direct oligodendrocyte infection [39] . MS onset may occur long after acute infection as consistently demonstrated for by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [40] . Infectious mononucleosis by EBV supervening during the early adulthood, in fact, is an established risk factor for further MS development [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] ; moreover, compelling evidence shows that almost all subjects with MS have positive serology for EBV. The ""prime/challenging"" theory has been proposed to explain the delay between early infection and MS onset; according to this assumption, the initial infection, such as by EBV, would prime autoreactive cells in susceptible individuals via molecular mimicry and bystander activation, setting up a fertile-field. Further infection by other microorganism, or even reactivation of EBV under favouring circumstances, will activate the preexisting autoreactive cells leading to inflammatory demyelination [40, 46] . Studies in MS patients infected by SARS-CoV2 are ongoing aiming at identifying the effects of iatrogenic immune modulation/ suppression on the severity of infection [47, 48] . Nevertheless, the effect of the virus on MS-related inflammatory activity has not been investigated yet, but few cases of acute inflammatory demyelinating disorder have been already described. It would not be surprising that SARS-CoV2 might act as ""priming"" or ""challenging"" infectious agent in ""primed"" individuals. Moreover, in individuals with MS, autoreactive T cells able to recognize both viral and myelin antigens have been found [49] . Additionally, SARS-CoV2 infection is associated with peripheral lymphopenia in more than 80% of patients with COVID-19. Lymphopenia is sustained by a predominant decrease of CD3 + , CD8 + , and CD4 + T cell counts, while B cells and NK are only mildly affected [50] . Patients infected by SARS-CoV during the 2002-04 outbreak recovered normal T lymphocytes count in about 2 months in the majority of case, and more rarely the recovery took more than 12 months [51] . Sequestration in the lung, intestine and other tissues, and senescence and exhaustion of the anti-viral CD8 response [50, 52] , explain this selective immunodepletion. We can speculate that defective antiviral CD8 immunological response may reduce immunosurveillance on other latent pathogens potentially able to trigger MS or other post-infectious demyelinating disorders, such as Guillain-Barrè syndrome or its variants [53] . Co-infection with EBV, in fact, has been observed in patients affected by COVID-19, mainly in those with lower CD4/CD8 ratio [54] . Nevertheless, unbalance of peripheral lymphocyte subsets induced by COVID-19, and in particular B cell overshooting, may hypothetically represent an additional risk for MS relapses in patients with pre-existing diagnosis, as observed in similar immunological framework [55] . The ""cytokine storm"" in response to the SARS-CoV2 infection may promote a switch toward a pro-inflammatory status of T cell subsets, such as Th17, which are implicated in MS pathogenesis [56] COVID-19 may indeed trigger MS or its clinical manifestation also through other mechanisms. In MS, intestinal dysbiosis and changes in intestinal permeability are increasingly recognized as modulators of neuroinflammatory mechanisms through the so-called gut-brain axis [57] . Therefore, the alteration of the intestinal barrier and microbiota induced by SARS-CoV2 may enhance autoreactive response (as previously mentioned). Finally, it is worth noting that SARS-CoV2 is able to directly infect the CNS via olfactory pathway or hematogenous route using the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor type 2 (ACE2) expressed in the CNS and in the vascular endothelium [6] . Coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus, may invade neurons and oligodendrocytes, establish a persistent infection of astrocytes and locally activate and immortalize microglial cells causing brain and spinal demyelination featuring MS, as observed in animal models and humans [58] [59] [60] [61] . Moreover, strains of human coronavirus have been found in brain autoptic specimens of patients with MS [62] ; additionally, MS patients show higher intrathecal antibody synthesis against coronaviruses than matched controls [45] . Building on these evidences, MS may result from previous SARS-CoV2 infection due several mechanisms: (1) a ""challenging"" effect of the virus in susceptible subjects previously exposed to priming pathogens; (2) unbalance of peripheral lymphocyte subsets and massive cytokine release producing a pro-inflammatory environment and triggering autoimmune reactions; (3) induction of post-infectious demyelinating events associated with direct CNS invasion and microglial reaction. Narcolepsy is a rare sleep disorder featured by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and REM sleep-associated symptoms, such as cataplexy (loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions), hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The prevalence of narcolepsy in 2016 was of 44.3 per 100,000 persons [63] . The main increase in narcolepsy diagnosis was in particular evident following Influenza-A H1N1 pandemic in 2009, and was evident in both patients affected by Influenza-A H1N1 and in patients vaccinated against this virus with Pandemrix (an adjuvanted vaccine) [64] . International classification of Sleep Disorders-3rd Edition classifies narcolepsy into two types, namely narcolepsy types 1 and 2 (NT1/2) [65] . The main clinical difference between these two forms of narcolepsy is the occurrence of cataplexy, which is the result of orexin (OX) neuron degeneration [65] . The OX system degeneration results in the not detectable levels of OX in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), consisting of the main diagnostic feature of NT1 [66] . Conversely, in NT2, the partial degeneration of OX neurons corresponds to normal CSF OX levels [67] . The main pathogenic causes of narcolepsy have been exclusively supposed with different levels of evidence since OX neuron degeneration remains a not-well-explained phenomenon. Several lines of evidence suggest that narcolepsy arises from the interaction of genetic, environmental and triggering factors, which leads to an immune-mediated selective loss or dysfunction of OX neurons in the brain lateral hypothalamus. Briefly, as summarized by Bassetti and coauthors [68] , genetic factors (especially HLA-DQB1*06:02 positivity) are a strong predisposition to narcolepsy. Ensuing this genetic susceptibility, environmental exposures to bacterial and viral infections may alter or trigger the immune system reaction that in turn may attack the OX neurons. Several researches have been performed to understand the cascade of events leading to OX system and involving the different subsets of immune cells (B cells, T CD4 + and T CD8 + cells) [69, 70] . Not significant results have been achieved regarding the detection of specific autoantibodies produced by B cells [71] ; conversely, T cells seem to have direct and indirect effects on OX neurons. In particular, in 2018, autoreactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells targeting antigens expressed by OX neurons have been documented in patients with NT1 or NT2 [72] . This research highlighted the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy; however, the lack of proliferation of T cell clones in response to H1N1 influenza vaccine does not permit to achieve a definite conclusion [72] . Therefore, although widely supposed the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy, the chain of events producing OX neuron degeneration has not been completely identified. Finally, the increased levels of specific cytokines (TNF and IL-6 among others) further support the evidence of an inflammatory and immune response in patients with narcolepsy since the very early phases of the disease [73] . The reduction of CSF ß-amyloid 42 levels in patients with narcolepsy near to disease onset has been also associated with the brain inflammatory response [74] [75] [76] . Moreover, other proofs of the activation of the immune system have been documented in patients with NT1, also with long-lasting disease [77] . The SARS-CoV2 viral outbreak may also present a unique opportunity to better understand the association between immune system activation and the development of autoimmune conditions such as narcolepsy [78] . Considering the non-haematological routes of infection, SARS-CoV2 can migrate from the olfactory bulb to hypothalamus and affect the OX neurons [78] . In keeping with this hypothetical model of CNS damage, the olfactory bulb may represent a link between environmental agents (such as SARS-CoV2) and narcolepsy, in patients with a genetic predisposition [79] . The olfactory bulb, in fact, provides an efficient port for neuroinvasion [80] . Neurotropic, but also non-neurotropic, viruses may use this gateway to enter the CNS using the BBB disruption caused by the activated inflammatory processes [80] . Moreover, the inflammatory response (in particular proinflammatory cytokines) can enhance BBB permeability promoting the transendothelial migration of T cells (activated against the virus), which can damage the OX hypothalamic neurons [81] . The documentation of olfactory dysfunction in patients with narcolepsy can reinforce this hypothesis and highlight the role of olfactory bulb in the pathogenic mechanisms of narcolepsy [82] . Taking these hypotheses into account, the main message of this review to sleep medicine clinicians and researches is to consider SARS-CoV2 infection as a possibly triggering event leading to narcolepsy. The previous experience of Influenza-A H1N1 infection and vaccination should raise the opportunity to monitor subjects affected with COVID-19 also after resolution of the infection since the occurrence of EDS (in same cases already present during the infection) may represent a preliminary manifestation of OX dysfunction.

The scheme represents direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 that overlap with defined pathogenic mechanisms of common and rare chronic neurological disorders, suggesting its potential role as risk factor@story_separate@Both retrospective analysis achieved by reviewing clinical charts of patients with COVID-19 and prospective observational studies [2, 83, 84] provided compelling evidence on the CNS involvement during SARS-CoV2 infection, which definitely supports the hypothesis of a neuropathogenic effect of the virus. Early experimental data on SARS-CoV2 and existing literature about other coronaviruses allow supposing several mechanisms of neuroinvasion of the virus, including the trans-synaptic spread from peripheral nerves, the BBB passage mediated by ACE2 receptors or abnormal permeability, and the ""Trojan horse"" strategy due to the brain entrance of immune cells infected through ACE2 receptors [2, 6] . This brief narrative review summarized the mechanisms of CNS affection during SARS-CoV2 infection, which include different pathways and pathogenic cascades, concluding in chronic neuroinflammatory or neurodegenerative processes that typically underlie both common (PD and MS) or rare (narcolepsy) neurological diseases. In addition to direct neuronal injury, we also highlighted how SARS-CoV2 might have a role in the successive development of these chronic neurological disorders because of the activation of systemic inflammatory response, favouring a culprit unbalance in the immune system or affecting other critical players of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, such as BBB integrity and gut-brain axis (Fig. 1) . Although long-term neuropathogenic effect of SARS-CoV2 has not yet been proven in experimental settings, available knowledge on both COVID-19 clinical events and established pathophysiological dynamics of chronic neurological disorders lead us to look at SARS-CoV2 infection as a potential trigger or risk factor for neurological disorders. In conclusion, prospective neurological follow-up of both COVID-19 survivors and asymptomatic infected individuals, and case-control observational studies are mandatory to establish the effective long-term neuropathogenicity of the virus and achieve early diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions. On the other hand, COVID-19 should be considered a critical anamnestic cue and serology for SARS-CoV2 infection can be planned when approaching patients with neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, or sleep disorders. Funding This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors","SARS-CoV2 infection is responsible for a complex clinical syndrome, named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), whose main consequences are severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Occurrence of acute and subacute neurological manifestations (encephalitis, stroke, headache, seizures, Guillain–Barrè syndrome) is increasingly reported in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV2 immunopathology and tissue colonization in the gut and the central nervous system, and the systemic inflammatory response during COVID-19 may potentially trigger chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. Specifically, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and narcolepsy present several pathogenic mechanisms that can be hypothetically initiated by SARS-CoV2 infection in susceptible individuals. In this short narrative review, we summarize the clinical evidence supporting the rationale for investigating SARS-CoV2 infection as risk factor for these neurological disorders, and suggest the opportunity to perform in the future SARS-CoV2 serology when diagnosing these disorders."
"Crisis events such as natural disasters, terror attacks and, more recently, a global pandemic place considerable strain on hospital systems and resources. 1 2 Critical care ventilators can provide support to patients suffering from a wide range of medical conditions. 3 However, a shortage of ventilators has serious implications for patient treatment and prognosis. Emergency and disposable transport ventilators (DTVs) have emerged as a potential alternative that could be used in the initial care of patients. Mechanical ventilation (MV) is the standard respiratory care provided to critically ill patients who cannot maintain their airways or adequate oxygenation levels. DTVs are devices used in emergency or transport situations to provide positive pressure ventilation and to assist a patient in breathing. 4 These devices, for example, the Vortran GO2VENT and Egemen Life Control disposable ventilator, provide controlled ventilation with a fixed fraction of inspired oxygen and have simple controls for breath rate (BR) and tidal volume (V t ). Of note, the GO2VENT is also registered for up to 30 days of short-term use with the Food and Drug Administration. Weiss et al 5 compared manual and automatic resuscitators in an emergency medical situation during ventilation of intubated patients and concluded no significant difference in overall patient care between the two resuscitator types. A recent study by Afacan et al 6 investigated the efficacy and safety of a DTV; based on patient vital signs and blood gas Open access analyses, the authors found that the disposable ventilator tested was a reliable option for short-term ventilation of critically ill mechanically ventilated patients during transport. To the best of the authors' knowledge, while a number of studies involving resuscitators are available, 2 4-6 no studies have been performed in combination with aerosol therapy, and comparative aerosol delivery efficiencies remains unclear. Respiratory diseases are a leading cause of critical illness and subsequent provision of respiratory support with combination aerosol therapy is now a mainstay treatment used within the intensive care unit and emergency departments. [7] [8] [9] Aerosol therapy provides high local drug concentrations with few systemic side effects. Examples of inhaled aerosol agents include bronchodilators and mucolytics which are used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. 9 10 A number of studies have reported on the factors that can affect aerosol drug delivery, such as choice of aerosol generator, artificial airway selection, placement within the respiratory circuit and humidification. Alhamad et al 11 showed that aerosol delivery with a vibrating mesh nebuliser (VMN) and pressurised metered-dose inhaler was more efficient than with a jet nebuliser (JN) in an in vitro paediatric breathing model. The position of the aerosol generator also greatly influences aerosol drug delivery in ventilated patients. Studies by both Berlinski et al 12 and Ari et al 13 showed improved aerosol deposition when the aerosol generator was placed at the dry side of the humidifier compared with at the wye in both adult and paediatric settings. Finally, various reports have shown how the presence of active and passive humidification, via a heated humidifier or heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs), within the respiratory circuit can influence aerosol deposition. 13 14 Ari et al 14 reported lower and more consistent aerosol drug delivery with an HME than with a standard non-humidified model. To date, there has been no study that has examined the potential of DTVs to successfully deliver aerosol for the short-term treatment of ventilator-dependent patients. The hypothesis under investigation in this piece of work is whether DTVs are a viable short-term alternative to MVs for the delivery of aerosol treatments to ventilatordependent patients. It is well documented in MV studies that nebuliser type, position within the respiratory circuit and humidification can significantly affect the potential aerosol dose a patient receives. The potential effects, if any, of these variables on aerosol drug delivery during simulated ventilation of adult and paediatric patient models will also be examined.@story_separate@The following section outlines the materials and methods used to assess the effectiveness of commercially available DTVs. The DTVs used in this study were the GO2VENT, manufactured by Vortran Medical (USA) and the Life Control disposable ventilator, produced by Egemen International-TMT Medical Products (Turkey). Neither of these ventilators have a display or gauge with the BR, V t or inspiratory to expiratory ratio (I:E) generated. These devices have an analogue manometer which provides a reading of the Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP). The respiratory circuit used in this study is presented in figure 1 . All experiments were performed with an 8.0 mm (adult) or 5.0 mm (paediatric) inner-diameter endotracheal tube (ETT) (Flexicare; Flexicare Medical, Wales, UK) connected to a capture filter (RespirGard II 303, Baxter, Ireland) and a test lung (IMT SmartLung; IMT Analytics AG, Buchs, Switzerland). The effect of passive humidification, via an heat and moisture exchange (HME) filter (Gibeck Humid Flo HME; Teleflex, North  Carolina, USA), on the dose delivered to the patient was also examined. The respiratory circuit had the capability to be adapted for both adult and paediatric patient types, with the appropriate t-piece, ETT and test lung placed in situ. The total length and diameter of the adult respiratory circuit, from the exit of the DTV to the capture filter, varied from 680 to 760 mm, and from 8 to 22 mm, depending on the nebuliser type and mode of connection to the circuit. The paediatric respiratory circuit length and diameter varied from 670 to 750 mm and from 5 to 15 mm. The effect of aerosol generator location within the respiratory circuit was also examined (see figure 1 ). Two different positions were considered: (1) proximal (between the ETT and the end of the elbow of the respiratory circuit tubing) and (2) distal (between the HME filter and the respiratory circuit tube) to the ETT. Experiments were performed using a closed circuit VMN (Aerogen Solo; Aerogen, Galway, Ireland) and an open circuit JN (Cirrus Jet Nebuliser; Intersurgical, UK). The JN was operated at a driving gas flow rate of 7 L/min and run until sputter+1 min for each condition in this study. The performance characteristics of the VMN and JN, measured using laser diffraction (Spraytec; Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) and described previously in MacLoughlin et al, 15 are presented as the average droplet size (µm), expressed as volumetric median diameter (VMD) and aerosol flow rate (mL/min). The VMN had a measured VMD of 4.26±0.08 µm and an aerosol flow rate of 0.33±0.02 mL/min; the JN had a VMD of 4.64±0.26 µm and an aerosol flow rate of 0.52±0.01 mL/min. The particle size data reported here represent the VMD of the nebulisers when operated outside of the respiratory circuit. However, when operating within a working respiratory circuit, the size of the aerosol particles that reach a patient, that is, post-ETT, can be much smaller than what is exiting the nebuliser. 16 17 Aerosol dose characterisation A 2.5 mL dose of albuterol sulfate (1 mg/mL) (Glax-oSmithKline, Dublin, Ireland) was aerosolised using both the VMN and the JN. Albuterol was chosen as it is a commonly nebulised formulation used by first responders in the emergency setting, as well as being the drug of choice in the characterisation of aerosol drug delivery systems, as specified in the international standard ISO 27427:2013. Aerosol dose was determined by quantifying the mass of drug captured on a filter proximal to the test lung. The mass of the drug was quantified by ultraviolet spectrophotometry at 276 nm and interpolation on a standard curve of albuterol concentrations. Results, indicating the dose delivered, are expressed as a percentage of the nominal dose placed in the applicable nebuliser medication cup. Results are expressed as the mean±SD aerosol/lung dose (percentage). Paired t-tests were conducted to establish if the aerosol dose varied significantly across different nebuliser types at different positions within the respiratory circuit. P values of<0.05 were considered statistically significant. The experiments were repeated five times independently (n=5) for each test scenario. This research was done without patient involvement. Patients were not invited to comment on the study design and were not consulted to develop patient relevant outcomes or interpret the results. Patients were not invited to contribute to the writing or editing of this document for readability or accuracy. In order to ensure that the DTVs could effectively deliver the required ventilation rates to the adult and paediatric patient models, a CITRIX H4 breath analyser (Intermedical AG, Buchs, Switzerland) was used to confirm the breathing patterns. Standard adult (V t =500 mL, BR=15 beats/min and I:E=1.0:1.0) and paediatric (Vt=300 mL, The data presented in the following section reflect the overall effectiveness of DTVs in delivering aerosol to a particular patient model rather than a tête-à-tête evaluation of the individual devices. As such, the data reported in this section are the range in lung dosages (%) delivered to the different simulated patient models. The results do, however, offer an evaluation as to the most effective form of aerosol generator and respiratory circuit arrangement that can be used to most effectively treat either an adult or a paediatric patient. Figure 2 is a box plot comparing the performance of the two different nebulisers, at two different locations within the respiratory circuit, with and without passive humidification for a simulated, intubated, adult patient. For both nebuliser types, nebuliser position and passive humidification had a significant effect on the potential dose (%) an adult patient would receive, p<<0.05 see online supplemental table 2. The largest lung doses (%) were measured when the nebulisers, both VMN and JN, were positioned proximal to the ETT (VMN: 25.19%-34.15% and JN: 3.14%-8.92%) and when an HME was included in the respiratory circuit (VMN: 32.37%-40.43% and JN: 5.60%-9.91%). Irrespective of position and humidification in the respiratory circuit, use of the VMN resulted in the largest lung dose (%). A similar trend was recorded in the paediatric model data (see figure 3 and online supplemental table 2), where the largest lung doses (%) were measured when either nebuliser was positioned proximal to the ETT (VMN: 8.12%-10.89% and JN: 2.15%-3.82%) and the HMEF (VMN: 8.18%-11.02% and JN: 2.34%-4.00%) was incorporated into the respiratory circuit. However, the addition of an HMEF had no statistically significant effect on the potential lung dose (%) when either nebuliser was placed proximal to the ETT, that is, the position that resulted in the largest lung dose (%), p>>0.05. Hence, in an adult patient, ventilated with a DTV, the nebuliser type, location in the circuit and respiratory Open access circuit setup to maximise the lung dose (%) is as follows: a VMN, positioned proximal to the ETT and with an HMEF between the DTV and the respiratory circuit tubing. While in a paediatric patient, ventilated with a DTV, a VMN, positioned proximal to the ETT, with or without an HMEF results in the largest lung dose (%). This study was designed to assess the potential of DTVs to successfully deliver aerosol to simulated, intubated, adult and paediatric patient models. Similar to MV studies, the delivery of aerosol was found to be significantly influenced by the type of aerosol generator, position in the respiratory circuit and the presence of passive humidification. The effects of aerosol generator selection on delivery efficiency have been documented in a number of publications for both adult and paediatric patients 12 13 18 19 in MV studies. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to make use of a DTV to deliver aerosol. Similar to the aforementioned referenced studies, the VMN consistently outperformed the JN, for both adult, 1.4-4.6-fold higher lung dose (%), 13 20 and paediatric patient models of higher lung dose (%) of 1.2-3.5-fold 18 19 patient models. The data presented in this study are in line with those studies, where use of a VMN resulted in a lung dose of 2.5-5.0-fold (%) than the JN in the simulated adult patient. While in the simulated paediatric patient, use of the VMN resulted in a larger lung dose (%) of 3.0-4.5-fold. The reasons for the superior performance of the VMN over the JN have been documented previously in a number of other publications 21-23 and as such do not need to be restated. The maximum aerosol delivery was achieved when the nebuliser, VMN or JN, was positioned proximal to the ETT for either patient type (p<<0.05; see online supplemental tables 1 and 2). This result is contrary to the findings reported in numerous traditional MV studies, where the largest lung and tracheal doses (%) received by the patient occurred when the nebuliser was positioned distal to the ETT, that is, proximal to the ventilator. 12 13 18 24 In the current study, when the nebuliser was placed distal to the ETT, proximal to the DTV (see figure 1) , the generated aerosol must pass through a 90° turn prior to the ETT. As such, there is considerable aerosol loss and deposition at this point in the respiratory circuit, particularly when the JN is used in the circuit due to the additional air flow from the compressor required to drive the nebuliser. When positioned proximal to the ETT (see figure 1 ), the aerosol generators deliver aerosol directly into the ETT, therefore minimising areas within the respiratory circuit for aerosol to deposit prior to reaching a potential patient. It is proposed that the much simpler respiratory circuit arrangement used with a DTV is the reason for this contrary finding. The potential benefits of passive humidification on the delivered lung dose (%) were also examined. An HME filter was placed in the respiratory circuit proximal to the DTV (see figure 1 ). HMEs are often incorporated into respiratory circuits to ensure adequate humidification as the upper airway is bypassed during intubation. Ari et al 14 compared the aerosol deposition in simulated, intubated, ventilated adult patients with and without an HMEF. The authors found that the HMEF had no effect on aerosol dose (%) in the setup, which incorporated exhaled humidity. However, in the setup without exhaled humidity, the addition of an HMEF resulted in a lower delivered dose (%) than the control case (no HMEF). The present study was conducted without exhaled humidity and the HMEF was positioned proximal to the DTV, which was upstream of the nebuliser in both respiratory circuit arrangements (see figure 1 ). During inspiration, the circuit becomes charged with aerosol. DTV respiratory circuits are a single limb circuit and the exhalatory breath passes back through the circuit to the release port on the DTV. It is proposed that, due to its position in the respiratory circuit, the HMEF acts as a resistance to the return flow of aerosol; as such, a greater quantity of aerosol remains within the circuit to be delivered. In the paediatric patient model, it is postulated that this phenomenon does not occur due to the significant aerosol losses that occur in the smaller ETT, paediatric ETT: 5.0 mm ID 20 cm length, adult ETT: 8.0 MM ID 30 cm length, p>>0.05 when comparing lung dose (%) with and without an HMEF at the same nebuliser position in the circuit (see online supplemental table 2). The intention of this study was to perform an in vitro investigation of the ability of DTVs to deliver aerosol effectively and efficiently. Limitations of the study design include the following: only a single breath type for both patient types was used and only a single JN type was used. Neither patient model incorporated exhaled humidity; additional research is required to determine the effects on dose delivery (%).

Nebuliser type, position within the respiratory circuit and passive humidification, via an HMEF, were found to significantly affect the potential delivered dose (%) in both adult and paediatric patient models. During simulated ventilation of an adult patient, placement of a VMN proximal to the ETT, with an HMEF in the respiratory circuit, provided the highest lung dose (%). Similarly, in a paediatric patient, the VMN placed proximally to the ETT provided the highest lung dose (%); however, the addition of an HMEF to the circuit made no statistically significant difference to the result. The findings reported herein should inform caregivers on appropriate or improved device selection and consequently may have a significant effect on clinical outcomes.

Concurrent aerosol drug delivery is often prescribed to such patients. As such, this study examines one such short-term option, the disposable gas-powered transport ventilator to effectively deliver aerosol therapy. Factors such as aerosol generator type, patient breathing pattern, humidification and nebuliser position within the respiratory circuit were also examined. METHODS: Aerosol drug delivery characterisation was undertaken using two different disposable transport ventilators (DTVs). Two different nebuliser types, a closed circuit vibrating mesh nebuliser (VMN) and an open circuit jet nebuliser (JN), at different locations in a respiratory circuit, proximal and distal to an endotracheal tube (ETT), with and without passive humidification, were evaluated in simulated adult and paediatric patients. RESULTS: Placement of a nebuliser proximal to the ETT (VMN: 25.19%–34.15% and JN: 3.14%–8.92%), and the addition of a heat and moisture exchange filter (VMN: 32.37%–40.43% and JN: 5.60%–9.91%) resulted in the largest potential lung dose in the adult patient model. Irrespective of nebuliser position and humidification in the respiratory circuit, use of the VMN resulted in the largest potential lung dose (%). A similar trend was recorded in the paediatric model data, where the largest potential lung dose was recorded with both nebuliser types placed proximal to the ETT (VMN: 8.12%–10.89% and JN: 2.15%–3.82%). However, the addition of a heat and moisture exchange filter had no statistically significant effect on the potential lung dose (%) a paediatric patient would receive (p>>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that transport ventilators, such as DTVs, can be used concurrently with aerosol generators to effectively deliver aerosolised medication in both adult and paediatric patients."
"Coronavirus Disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a pandemic by the WHO on 11 th of March 2020 [1] and continues to challenge healthcare systems around the globe. While most patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 present only mild and non-specific symptoms, i.e., fever and cough, fatigue, or myalgias [2] [3] [4] [5] , severe complications include respiratory failure, sepsis and cardiac mortality [6, 7] . More than half of all SARS-CoV-2 transmissions are accounted for by asymptomatic patients, which demonstrates the need for comprehensive testing [8] . A recent comprehensive meta-analysis reported excellent sensitivity (94%) and limited specificity (37%) of LDCT [9] . While the specificity of the RT-PCR test is assumed 100%, sensitivity gradually increases from the day of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (100% false-negative) to a minimum of 20% false-negative at day eight after infection, as another recent meta-analysis showed [10] . An early and accurate detection of COVID-19 infected patients is important for individual and healthcare reasons, since an early estimation of required intensive care capacities is substantial to not overstrain the hospital system. Thus, the Radiological Society of North America suggests diagnostic LDCT for all patients with worsening respiratory status and moderate to severe features consistent with COVID-19 as well as high risk for intensive care treatment in the near future [11, 12] . Besides the evaluation of pulmonary infiltration at the different stages of COVID-19, non-contrast LDCT allows for limited assessment of the thoracic aorta. In particular, calcified atherosclerotic plaques can be detected on LDCT, considering their high intrinsic contrast to the adjacent soft tissue. Vascular calcification and, more specifically, aortic wall calcification (AWC) is the endpoint of an atherosclerotic transformation of the vessel wall [13, 14] . Atherosclerosis reflects the lifetime burden of all known and unknown factors causing systemic atherosclerotic disease [15] , including high age, active smoking, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and arterial hypertension [16] . The magnitude of AWC as an indicator of the burden of atherosclerotic disease correlates with cardiovascular risk factors (CRF) [17, 18] and predicts the likelihood of a cardiovascular event [19, 20] . Therefore, individual CRFs and cardiovascular comorbidities can be estimated by quantification of AWC on a non-contrast LDCT scan. Based on several clinical papers, severe progression of COVID-19 and poor patient outcome is strongly associated with existing CRFs and cardiovascular comorbidity [3, [21] [22] [23] [24] . In two early studies on COVID-19, 63-67% of deceased patients were reported to suffer from cardiovascular comorbidities, most commonly hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease [2, 7] . This suggests that the measurement of AWC can act as a predictor for the COVID-19 outcome and in particular, the requirement of intensive care treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate if the magnitude of AWC determined via LDCT is a feasible biomarker to predict the patient's risk for severe COVID-19 progression.@story_separate@a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 All procedures performed in our retrospective study involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Cologne by the approval number 20-1367. Written consent of the patients was waived due to prior anonymization of data and retrospective study characteristics. All imaging was performed for clinical indications. No scan was conducted explicitly for the purpose of this study. Patients were enrolled from two primary care hospitals in Germany, � blinded � (below center 1) and � blinded � (below center 2). We screened the databases for consecutive patients with LDCT from the 10 th of March to the 30 th of June, 2020. Indication for the acquisition of LDCT at both centers was defined by clinical considerations. LDCT was performed for patients with 1. moderate and severe clinical features in suspected or RT-PCR positive COVID-19; 2. worsening of respiratory status in suspected or RT-PCR positive COVID-19. Inclusion criteria for our study were: 1. a parallel LDCT and mouth swab with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2; 2. patient age �18 years; 3. follow-up of at least 22 days after admission to the hospital-based on reported data [2] . One patient was excluded due to severe beam hardening artifacts, which rendered identification of vascular plaques impossible. COVID-19 outcome was rated by clinical features on a scale from 1-5 for each patient by a single observer at both institutions, higher numbers representing a more severe progression of the disease (no hospitalization = 1, hospitalization = 2, intensive care unit (ICU) = 3, tracheal intubation = 4, death = 5). Outcomes 1 and 2 were called moderate, while 3-5 were considered severe. Endpoints 3-5 implied obligation for intensive care treatment throughout the included patients. Each patient was observed for 22 days after admission to the hospital. The highest achieved endpoint during the observation period was noted. A basic cardiovascular comorbidity score was investigated for each patient in order to test the robustness of the independent variable AWC against clinical data. The 5-point score introduced below can be determined in a quick interview and by reviewing a patients' daily medication. One point was added for each positive observation from the five following items: 1. history of arterial hypertension or antihypertensive drugs in medication, 2. type 2 diabetes or anti-diabetic medication, 3. prior cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction or revascularization procedure, stroke or transient ischemic attack, diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease), 4. hyperlipidemia or lipid-lowering agents in medication, 5. active smoking habit. The used score respects the three most consistently reported clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19 (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes) [25] as well as two additional points for hyperlipidemia and active smoking, which are further assumed risk factors [26] [27] [28] [29] . All clinically indicated CT examinations were performed on CT scanners of two vendors (center 1: iCT 256, Philips and center 2: SOMATOM Definition AS+, Siemens). Patients were scanned in a head-first supine position. No contrast agent was administered. Scan parameters in center 1 were: mean exposure 28.0 ± 9.3 mAs, collimation 80 × 0.625 mm, pitch 0.763, tube voltage 120 kV, matrix 512 x 512, slice thickness 2 mm, overlap 1 mm, mean CTDIvol 1.9 ± 0.6 mGy, mean DLP 80.8 ± 26.5 mGy � cm. Scan parameters in center 2 were: mean exposure 116.3 ± 41.3 mAs, collimation 38.4 × 0.6 mm, pitch 1.2, tube voltage 100-140 kV, matrix 512 x 512, slice thickness 1 mm, overlap 0 mm, mean CTDIvol 7.6 ± 2.5 mGy, mean DLP 262.6 ± 90.2 mGy � cm. Quantification of AWC was performed using the vendor's software (IntelliSpace Portal, HeartBeat-CS, Philips Healthcare). The software highlighted all regions with a minimum volume of 0.5 mm 3 and attenuation above 130 HU with a color-coded overlay (Fig 1) , as originally described by Janowitz, Agatston et al. [30] . For different tube voltages than 120 kV, the attenuation threshold was adjusted based on reported data [31] . The attenuation thresholds were 145.0 HU for 100 kV tube voltage, 136.0 HU for 110 kV, 126.1 HU for 130 kV and 123.4 HU for 140 kV. One radiologist (experience in chest CT imaging of more than two years) manually confirmed highlighted lesions with a mouse click. Aortal plaques were included from the ascending thoracic aorta to the diaphragm. Aortic valve calcifications and calcifications associated with the coeliac trunk were excluded from the measurements. The software automatically performed three-dimensional volumetry without specific user interaction of all connected voxels in each marked lesion above the attenuation threshold, after all, automatic segmentations were manually validated. The total of AWC in mm 3 was noted. Statistical analysis was performed in R language for statistical computing, R Foundation, Vienna, Austria, version 4.0.0. Multivariate regression was used to model the relationship between the dependent variable ""severe COVID-19"" and the regressors AWC as well as the control variables patient age, sex and cardiovascular comorbidity score. Magnitude of AWC in mm 3 was transformed to a logarithmic scale before multivariate regression to reduce impact of outliers. For patients without measurable AWC, a substitute AWC of 1 mm 3 was assumed. Multivariate regression was implemented by the glm() function in ""binomial"" mode. Visualization of the regression curve was achieved by the visreg package for R, version 2.7.0 [32] . To illustrate the accuracy of fit of the logistic regression, pseudo-R 2 was calculated as described by Nagelkerke (> 0.2 acceptable, > 0.4 good, > 0.5 very good) [33] . To preclude multicollinearity of the independent variables, the variance inflation factor (VIF) was calculated for each independent variable using the cars package for R (< 2.5 no significant multicollinearity) [34, 35] . Wilcoxon test was performed for comparison of ordinal data (outcome, clinical comorbidity score) and non-parametric data (AWC), chi-squared test for nominal data (patient sex), and two-sided T-test for parametric data (patient age). All mentioned values are stated as average ± standard deviation, if not otherwise specified. Statistical significance was defined as p � 0.05. Within multivariate logistic regression modeled by the independent variables of patient age, sex, cardiovascular comorbidity score and magnitude of AWC, the latter was the only significant regressor for severe COVID-19 (p = 0.004). The regression model notably benefitted from inclusion of AWC in addition to the demographic and clinical risk factors (Table 2) . For AWC > 3000 mm 3 , average patient age, sex and cardiovascular comorbidity score, the regression predicted a risk of severe COVID-19 of 0.78 (95% CI 0.46-0.94). Without visually detectable AWC, the risk of severe COVID-19 was 0.13 (95% CI 0.04-0.36) (Fig 2) . The regression's accuracy of fit is represented by a pseudo-R 2 = 0.43, as calculated by the Nagelkerke method. Multicollinearity among the independent variables is ruled out by a low VIF for each  Pseudo-R 2 (Nagelkerke) Demographic data (patient age and sex) 0.23 (""acceptable"") . . . clinical data (anamnestic comorbidity score) 0.29 (""acceptable"") . . . CT-derived data (AWC) 0.43 (""good"") The accuracy of fit of our multivariate logistic regression model to predict severe COVID-19 benefitted from including clinical data in addition to generic demographic patient details. The best accuracy of fit was achieved by our final model including demographic, clinical and CT-derived data (Pseudo-R 2 0.43). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244267.t002 explanatory variable. The VIF was 1.9, 1.9, 1.0 and 1.1 for AWC, patient age, sex and cardiovascular comorbidity score, respectively. From the very beginning of the pandemic, Chinese authors recognized a correlation of CRFs and cardiovascular comorbidities with a severe progression of the disease [2, 6, 7] . This observation was consistently confirmed by international authors [3, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . CRFs have further historically been linked to poor outcomes of infectious lung disease in general, such as an increase of myocardial infarctions during the influenza season [36] . Before the COVID-19 pandemic, magnitude of AWC has been shown to predict higher mortality of pneumonia without limitation to a specific infectious agent [37] . However, the biological causalities between CRFs and severe COVID-19 often still remain unexplained. Recent studies focus on the renin-angiotensin system since SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) for internalization to the host cell [22] . For individuals with chronic heart disease and diabetes, the host cell's altered receptor status might promote severe progression of COVID-19 [22] . Nicotine abuse increases the gene expression of ACE2 in lung tissue [24] , which might facilitate disease progression in smokers. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers, which are commonly prescribed in the context of arterial hypertension, have also been suspected to increase the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19 [21, 23] . Disregarding the exact biological pathways CRFs and cardiovascular comorbidities are significantly associated with severe COVID-19 and can be assessed by quantification of atherosclerotic vessel calcification. The short-term 5-day outcome of COVID-19 has been successfully predicted by quantification of lung involvement [38] . However, the extent of pulmonary changes most rapidly evolves during the first week of the disease [39] . This renders the outcome predictor ""extent of lung involvement"" highly susceptible to the time point of imaging during early COVID-19. For best individual patient outcome an early assessment of whether hospitalization or intensive care treatment might be necessary is required. In our study, the amount of AWC was the only significant regressor for the long-term 22-day outcome of COVID-19. AWC derive from chronic CRFs and do not vary short-term. Our logistic regression model notably profited by the inclusion of AWC in addition to demographic and clinical data. Pseudo-R 2 by the Nagelkerke method was 0.43, which is rated a ""good"" accuracy of fit [33] . This implies that 43% of the variance for the probability of severe progression of COVID-19 can be explained by our model. In comparison, a regression model including patient age, sex and clinical comorbidity score only achieved a pseudo-R 2 of 0.29. Assuming average values for patient age, sex and clinical comorbidity score, our model predicts the obligation for intensive care treatment as 0.78 for AWC > 3000 mm 3 . Vice versa, if there are no visually detectable AWC, the probability for admission to ICU is only 0.13. AWC represent the patient's atherosclerotic burden, which results from lifestyle-related risk factors and demographic parameters such as patient age or sex [37] . The assessment of a patients' cardiovascular comorbidity by quantification of AWC as a surrogate might prove favorable in the context of the current pandemic. Calcium scoring of the thoracic aorta can be performed in a few seconds in daily routine CT reporting. Moreover, fully automized, deep learning based approaches to assess AWC have been investigated, and first clinical solutions are available [40] [41] [42] . In comparison to a physical examination and individual in-depth anamnesis, calcium scoring on LDCT for assessment of cardiovascular comorbidity does not deplete personal protection equipment and does not add to the infection risk for medical professionals. In our study, a combination of simple clinical data and scoring of AWC yielded the most accurate results ( Table 2 ). The below threshold VIF of AWC (1.9) in our regression model confirms that AWC is not merely a recombination of the control variables patient age, sex and clinical comorbidity score, but an independent biomarker for upcoming severe complications of COVID-19. Limitations of our study are the relatively small patient population and simplified endpoints of the statistical analysis. Comorbidities were simplified to easily obtainable items, which recognizes that a comprehensive clinical examination and anamnesis might not be achievable for every individual during the pandemic. Future studies should include a larger number of patients in a prospective multi-center, multi-vendor approach and focus on automated processing of the LDCT scans, possibly identifying further risk factors for severe COVID-19 progression.@story_separate@During the current COVID-19 pandemic hospitals are at risk to decompensate due to unprecedented numbers of patients. Physicians from regional COVID-19 hotspots reported overwhelming numbers of patients resulting in a deficiency of ICU beds [43] [44] [45] . When medical resources have to be rationalized, it is crucial to identify patients in need of intensive care and invasive ventilation as early as possible [44] . Our study demonstrates a correlation of a severe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 and a high atherosclerotic burden of the thoracic aorta, measured at the time of patient admission to the hospital, which is an average of 12 days before the start of intensive care treatment [2] . Further prospective multi-center, multi-vendor studies should investigate if opportunistic calcium scoring can anticipate the number of required ICU beds in advance, which might facilitate resource management and promote collaboration of hospitals on a national and international scale.","BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular comorbidity anticipates poor prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) and correlates with the systemic atherosclerotic transformation of the arterial vessels. The amount of aortic wall calcification (AWC) can be estimated on low-dose chest CT. We suggest quantification of AWC on the low-dose chest CT, which is initially performed for the diagnosis of COVID-19, to screen for patients at risk of severe COVID-19. METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients (46 in center 1, 24 in center 2) with parallel low-dose chest CT and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were included in our multi-center, multi-vendor study. The outcome was rated moderate (no hospitalization, hospitalization) and severe (ICU, tracheal intubation, death), the latter implying a requirement for intensive care treatment. The amount of AWC was quantified with the CT vendor's software. RESULTS: Of 70 included patients, 38 developed a moderate, and 32 a severe COVID-19. The average volume of AWC was significantly higher throughout the subgroup with severe COVID-19, when compared to moderate cases (771.7 mm(3) (Q1 = 49.8 mm(3), Q3 = 3065.5 mm(3)) vs. 0 mm(3) (Q1 = 0 mm(3), Q3 = 57.3 mm(3))). Within multivariate regression analysis, including AWC, patient age and sex, as well as a cardiovascular comorbidity score, the volume of AWC was the only significant regressor for severe COVID-19 (p = 0.004). For AWC > 3000 mm(3), the logistic regression predicts risk for a severe progression of 0.78. If there are no visually detectable AWC risk for severe progression is 0.13, only. CONCLUSION: AWC seems to be an independent biomarker for the prediction of severe progression and intensive care treatment of COVID-19 already at the time of patient admission to the hospital; verification in a larger multi-center, multi-vendor study is desired."
"Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, first emerged as a public health threat in December of 2019. Patients initially presented to hospitals with respiratory symptoms tied to food consumption stemming from a market in Wuhan, China [1] . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus has continued to spread throughout the United States with a doubling time of approximately 6.5 days and a basic reproductive number of approximately 2.5 worldwide [2] . The rapid transmission rate of the virus has placed enormous pressure on researchers and healthcare systems worldwide to develop containment strategies and treatment options. As of June 7th, 2020, there have been 109,479 deaths caused by COVID-19 in the United States [3] . With variable enforcement and public adherence to social distancing and other containment methods, coupled with the lack of a cure or vaccine, infections and deaths attributed to COVID-19 are expected to continue escalating in the foreseeable future. Patients with COVID-19 can present along a wide spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic carriers to acute respiratory failure. Regardless of the physical manifestation, patients with COVID-19 can infect others through aerosolization of virus-filled droplets, fomite contamination, and interaction with other bodily fluids [1, 4] . The incubation period can last from two to 14 days, in which constitutional and respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, and dyspnea may occur [4] . Patients who are over 50 years of age and those with underlying chronic medical conditions are more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms, such as hypoxemia and respiratory distress [5] . Severe COVID-19 symptoms typically result in hospitalization and mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). Infection control and public health guidelines for COVID-19 have necessitated hospitals to restrict visitation and supportive services, requiring patients to convalesce in isolation [4, 5] . Delirium is defined as a disturbance in mental abilities that results in severe confusion and reduced awareness of one's surroundings [6] . Although the mechanism is still largely unknown, ICU patients have been shown to be at a higher risk for developing delirium. ICU delirium is associated with poorer health outcomes as patients have a prolonged hospital course and duration of mechanical ventilation, greater rates of self-extubation, and higher overall mortality and morbidity [7] . Supportive care through family and other sources has been recognized as a protective factor for the development and treatment of ICU delirium [6, 7] . COVID-19 patients, in particular, are at risk for developing ICU delirium due to isolation, family visitation restrictions, and staffing shortages. With the limitations on family and outside support, the responsibility of decreasing the risk and ameliorating the effects of COVID-19 ICU delirium falls upon the medical team. Culturally competent care has been shown to improve health outcomes and is critical to fostering an inclusive environment [8, 9] . Here we present a case of a 64-year-old Filipino male with COVID-19 associated ICU delirium and the role that culturally competent care plays in the healing process during a global pandemic.@story_separate@Mr. L is a 64-year-old Filipino male who presented to the emergency department (ED) with a one-day history of shortness of breath, which did not improve on rest. Past medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity. His social history was significant for being a former smoker with 10 pack years and having quit 30 years ago. Prior to ED assessment, the patient reported a five-day history of fever (maximum temperature of 104°F, with no improvement on acetaminophen) and four days of non-productive cough, body aches, and diarrhea. The patient was an essential worker as a chemical plant operator who interacted with many potential sick contacts. Vitals on admission revealed an oxygen saturation of 87% and temperature of 102°F. The patient was tachypneic and tachycardic, with respirations of 20 breaths per minute and heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Chest x-ray revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates and he was admitted due to progressive oxygen desaturation. COVID-19 nasal swab with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) was done on hospital day two, which returned positive on hospital day four. During this time, the patient began to deteriorate, progressing from using a nasal cannula and non-rebreather mask to requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Various combinations of fentanyl, propofol, and midazolam were used for comfort in addition to a trial of hydroxychloroquine. He was extubated on hospital day 23 after showing several days of marked improvement in oxygenation. Upon extubation on hospital day 23, the patient exhibited signs of agitation, anxiety, and confusion, manifested by disordered speech, disorientation to place and time, and attempts to remove intravenous (IV) lines and monitors. This continued until hospital day 30 in which the patient was found collapsed on the floor and laughing hysterically. Physical restraints and pharmacological mixtures of midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and lorazepam were used as needed. Limited intervention occurred during this period due to staffing shortages and lack of resources. During a telephone update with family members on hospital day 32, the health care team disclosed that nursing had been speaking to the patient in Spanish to encourage a more familiar atmosphere using their native language instead of English. Due to the rapid patient decline and expedited triage during admission, language preference and other identifiers were omitted from the chart. With this revelation, the family member informed that the patient did not speak Spanish, but rather was fluent in English and Tagalog (one of the languages of the Philippines). In the following days, a Tagalog speaking nurse or nursing assistant was assigned to the patient to facilitate cultural communication regarding the patient's health care and wishes. During this time, the patient was able to emphasize the importance of family and obtained a tablet to video call his wife and daughter, which resulted in a decline of delirium symptoms. The patient was downgraded to the medical floor on hospital day 33 and discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on hospital day 35. On first assessment with cognitive rehabilitation therapy, immediate and delayed verbal recall was impaired, but showed gradual improvement. The patient was discharged from the acute rehabilitation facility after 10 days with full recovery at home. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a perfect storm of conditions that promote ICU delirium. Twenty percent of COVID-19 positive patients require hospitalization and up to a quarter will require admission to an ICU, which represents five to 11% of the total infected population [10] . Early studies have shown that 20-30% of COVID-19 patients will present with or develop delirium during the course of their hospitalization, with a rate of 60-70% in cases of severe illness at all ages. Of those admitted to the ICU that are COVID-19 positive, 73.6% of these patients experience delirium that persists for approximately one week [10, 11] . The diagnosis of ICU delirium and COVID-19 ICU delirium are nearly identical and are made based on the acute onset of disturbance of attention and awareness, impaired cognition, agitation, and a sleep-wake cycle dysregulation in context of medical illness [11] . Treatment of ICU delirium typically involves the patient's family and support groups to create a familiar and inviting environment to gently reorient patients to their surroundings. These comforts, however, have been eliminated during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns for community level transmission and spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with state, local, and hospital administrations, have promulgated guidelines regarding management of visits to healthcare facilities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [12] . The rationale for these limitations is two-fold: prevention of spread from the community to the hospital (and vice versa) as well as safeguarding vulnerable populations in hospital settings. As COVID-19 patients are considered highly contagious, ICUs across the United States have implemented isolation protocols and negative pressure containment rooms to prevent community spread [13] . While important from an infection control and public health perspective, COVID-19 ICU patients have increasingly developed delirium status post extubation and mechanical ventilation weaning [10, 11] . Surrounded by faceless, masked personnel covered in protective equipment and a lack of family and supportive services that usually act as patient advocates and assistants during episodes of delirium, recovery from COVID-19 ICU delirium has been found to take longer than classical ICU delirium [7] . As seen in this case, the intense social isolation and increased use of both physical and chemical restraints for fear of transmission of COVID-19 can result in the exacerbation of delirium and prolongation of its course, resulting in poorer outcomes and accelerated mortality. This is in comparison to the ideal patient care with cultural competency (Figure 1 ). Limitations on providing humanistic care to COVID-19 ICU patients require healthcare workers to utilize alternative methods to minimize and treat delirium. Culturally competent care is defined as the ability and practice of healthcare professionals to respect the diversity in patients and acknowledges the role of cultural factors (language, ethnic beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors) in how patients interact with the healthcare system [14] . In the case of a COVID-19 ICU patient, feelings of isolation can lead to a worsening of wellbeing, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and anger, which can hasten the development of delirium [7] . Engaging patients through a familiar language, soliciting their beliefs and customs, incorporating family input, and having open body language are ways how culturally competent care is traditionally incorporated. Many of these methods have not been possible during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the aforementioned case, the staff attempted to apply culturally competent care, however, preconceived assumptions regarding the patient's ethnicity and language hindered advancement of care. In this case, coping mechanisms such as ""pakikisama""-conceding to the wishes of the collective and ""bahala na""-fatalistic resignation in which the patient's fate is up to God, are important to consider in working with Filipino patients [15] [16] [17] . In interacting with healthcare workers, personalism or ""hindi ibang tao"" -one of us/""ibang tao""-not one of us may dictate the level of trust and openness that a Filipino patient displays [18] . With Mr. L, having been spoken to in a foreign language (Spanish), this could have contributed to the conclusion that the staff was ibang tao or ""not one us"" and worsened his delirium. Improving cultural competence in medical staff can help to reduce biases, which in turn may improve patient outcomes and the patient experience [19] . The best known non-pharmacological solution to combat delirium has been to promote communication between the patient and family [20] . Unfortunately, the limitation on visitation makes personal, physical contact with loved ones impossible and further increases their risk of entering a state of delirium. Culturally, family is paramount in the Filipino community, with filial piety and intergenerational decision-making being key elements that intersect with healthcare decisions [15] [16] [17] . Other non-pharmacological, nonculture based solutions that are recommended include minimizing disruptions at nighttime to promote proper sleep, providing cognitive stimulation, providing physical mobilization and encouraging the use of family photos, phone calls, and virtual visits [11] . As seen with Mr. L, the use of a hospital tablet to communicate with family members virtually can be used as a beneficial tool to treat signs of delirium. To prevent hindering a COVID-19 patient's recovery, it would be ideal for medical staff to call family members, if the patient is unable to participate, to discuss a plan of care and seek a mutual agreement. Overall, the correct use of cultural competence by healthcare professionals is a crucial tactic to reduce some of the risk factors associated with delirium and is the best approach to provide patient-centered care during these difficult times.

The use of culturally competent care serves to assure the use of appropriate services and reduces the occurrence of medical errors due to misunderstandings caused by differences in language or culture. Familial involvement is critical for ICU delirium, however the COVID-19 pandemic has required healthcare providers to think beyond conventional means. The use of technology to virtually communicate with family also serves as a helpful tool to treat signs of delirium. As seen in this case, a lack of understanding of the Filipino culture resulted in assumptions on the part of the healthcare provider which led to the prolongation of delirium in a COVID-19 ICU patient, but the correct utilization of cultural competence helped the patient recover successfully. Similar considerations can be applied to other patients with COVID-19 ICU delirium as culture plays an important role in how patients understand and interface with the healthcare system.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, its high transmissibility required infected individuals to be placed in negative pressure isolation rooms when admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Studies have shown that limited social support can increase the risk of developing delirium during ICU stays. Minimal research exists on COVID-19-associated ICU delirium as hospitals and government organizations focus on combating equipment shortages and case surges. Here, we present the case of a 64-year-old Filipino male with COVID-19 ICU delirium status post-intubation and ventilation. His hospital course was complicated by the medical staff's assumption that the patient spoke Spanish and improved after being assigned a Tagalog-speaking nurse who facilitated family communication. This case highlights the importance of cultural competency and communication in the management of COVID-19 associated ICU delirium. In particular, Filipino cultural practices and their intersection with healthcare in the larger context of providing culturally competent care are highlighted. The use of culturally competent care serves to assure the use of appropriate services and reduces the occurrence of medical errors due to misunderstandings caused by differences in language or culture.

"Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems primary function is to deliver emergency medical care in all emergencies, including disasters; it is a system of coordinated response, involving multiple people and agencies. An efficient EMS system can help reduce injuries and mortality and is essential to ensure a prompt emergency response to urgent situations of illness or trauma. Out-of-hospital emergency medical services is a subsystem of EMS and refers to the delivery of medical care at the site of the adverse medical event [1] . Through a dispatch centre, out-of-hospital EMS answers emergency calls provide medical advice to the caller and, if needed, dispatches a mobile medical care unit. As a first response provider, out-of-hospital EMS must contribute to the reduction of unnecessary pressures on Emergency Departments (ED), through direct transportation to a more appropriate destination, by providing necessary care on-scene, or by providing advice over the telephone. Offering such alternatives has the potential to reduce pressures on the system but can also benefit patients by ensuring they receive 'the right treatment, at the right time, by the right person' [2] . Even though EMS systems have many similarities there is no common European or US standard agreed upon; in general, the EMS status of a country depends on its peculiar geographic, political, cultural, linguistic, historical and medical setting [1] . Given the heterogeneity of EMS systems, it is important to collect data to understand environmental management at a local level, and to disseminate data to health professionals and policymakers. This point is particularly important in times of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, where information flow between countries is vital for the cross-border interoperability of EMSs and effective coordinated response to crises. The most recent information available on the Italian EMS in Italy dates back to a 2005 survey, which was published by the Ministry of Health in 2007 and highlighted the wide regional differences in several aspects of EMS response [3] . Few recent studies have attempted to study the EMS response characteristics within specific health problems [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , in relation to time of response [9, 10] or about the accuracy of the data bases available [11] . In 2010 the Ministry of Health, in Italy, renewed its model of assistance [12] . The model points towards the enhancement of health care activities in the local area and the development of a network of specialised structures designated to the management of complex pathologies. This new model is further aimed to improve the regional EMS network. The territorial EMS network is the second level Public-Safety Answering Point (PASP) provided with a main operative centre, in charge of answering incoming calls, assessing the severity and activating the vehicle dispatch, and several local operation stations where staff and different types of rescue vehicles are allocated. Although EMS systems are organised according to national guidelines, they have regional autonomy, resulting in several different EMS response models [3, 13] . The recent pandemic has forced policymakers to reconsider EMS systems deeply and quickly, to better manage an increased number of calls, to avoid a large flow of people into EDs and, at the same time, to enhance population care on site by improving primary care [14, 15] . The services have been revised and soon reorganised to respond to the crisis without having the opportunity to reflect on the previous arrangement. Reconsidering the system's strengths and limitations at the local level before the pandemic will help decision-makers to make more appropriate and long-lasting structural changes to better meet the population needs. To the authors' knowledge, no studies in Italy have used available EMS data since its renewal to contribute to the improvement of a timely cost-effective EMS response. Given these premises, the purpose of this study is to analyse trends and characteristics of incoming emergency calls and corresponding EMS responses in one of the largest regions of Italy, to identify weaknesses of the pre-existing system in responding to emergency needs of the population.@story_separate@The Piedmont Region is the second largest of Italy's 20 regions, measuring 25,300 km 2 , and it ranks seventh in number of inhabitants (nearly 4.3 million in 1182 municipalities). The EMS in Piedmont consists of one regional operation centre and four operative stations, all of which are coordinated by a medical doctor and managed by nurses. There are three types of rescue vehicles available: advanced emergency medical vehicles (EMVs), basic EMVs, and one rescue helicopter for each centre. Advanced EMVs carry one of two rescue teams: type (1) doctors and nurses with advanced life-saving skills, as well as specially trained volunteer rescuers or type (2) nurses with advanced life-saving skills as well as specially trained volunteer rescuers. Basic EMVs carry a rescue team of specially trained volunteer rescuers with basic life support skills. Rescue helicopter teams consist of an anaesthesiologist, a nurse, and a mountain rescue technician. Incoming emergency calls are received by trained nurse operators in the 2nd level PSAP and assessed by means of a dynamic decision-making tool, the Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS). This systematic, digital program is structured to guide nurses in helping the caller to provide the required information, in determining the appropriate intervention (dispatch of a specific rescue vehicle or provide phone advice) and, in case of need, in instructing the rescue team to better respond to the identified health demands. It also assists nurses in assigning the correct EMS criticality code (red: need of an immediate response, life-threatening situation with a chance of survival; yellow: rapid response, presence of a possible life-threatening condition not in an immediate danger of death; green: the situation is not an emergency, presence of injuries, acute but stable conditions; and white: the situation is not an emergency, minor injuries not a life-threatening situation, medical care not often required) and in determining which rescue vehicle should be dispatched. A second nurse then locates and dispatches the requested rescue vehicle, based on the EMS criticality code and vehicle availability. Since 2012, selected regional MPDS data have been entered into the EMUR (EMergency-URgency) registry, which is the anonymised, official Ministerial Health Regional Database of all EMS interventions. The registry contains information on 70 different variables that cover incoming emergency calls, the type of intervention employed (phone advice, dispatch of a rescue vehicle, etc.), the rescue vehicle activation process, intervention outcomes, and patient information. Of these 70 variables, 51% (36 variables) are compulsory. Data are checked at the regional level for logical consistency and completeness before they are officially released for administrative or epidemiological purposes. The EMUR registry can be used, without further authorisation, for any epidemiological study. Moreover, the Regional Public Health Observatory, as a member of the Public Health Department (Local Health Board TO3), together with the University of Torino, have access to the EMUR registry; therefore, ethics committee approval was not required. Unfortunately, some weaknesses embedded in the current structure of the EMUR registry impede that an individual can be easily tracked throughout the whole process particularly when two or more rescue vehicles are dispatched for the same emergency call and/or when two or more patients are moved using the same rescue vehicle. For these reasons, to avoid any inconsistencies, the present analysis focused specifically on the EMS process, without detailing information on patient characteristics. The analysis assessed frequencies and characteristics of incoming emergency calls that ended with the dispatch of at least one rescue vehicle during a 5-year study period (2013-2017). Data for this period were extracted from the EMUR registry, including call information: caller, call time, call location; and rescue vehicle dispatch information: number of people involved, health problem/injury reported by the caller (classified by the operator according to International Classification of Disease (ICD) standard codes), type of rescue vehicle dispatched, number of rescue vehicles dispatched, and site of rescue completion. Data on the 2013-2017 population of the Piedmont Region were extracted from the public regional census database freely available on the net. All relationships in analyses and differences in events proportions between 2013 and 2017 were tested against the Pearson's Chi-Square with a 99% level of confidence. The likelihood of completing a rescue into a hospital ED by type of rescue vehicles in relation to the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) criticality codes assigned was evaluated by a set of logistic regressions. Results were presented as odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for all other variables. Population estimates were reported as a rate per 1000 inhabitants. All analyses were performed in Stata version release 14 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). A total of 2,120,838 incoming emergency calls were reported in the EMUR registry for the Piedmont Region during the study period ( Figure 1 ). Among these, 1,504,722 (71%) calls required some level of intervention of which 99.4% (n = 1,494,855) required the dispatch of at least one rescue vehicle, generating the dispatch of 1,658,728 rescue vehicles in total. In the remaining 9867 (0.6%) calls, the caller was given simple phone advice or that call was labelled ""transferred to another operative station"" for regional competency.  Between 2013 and 2017 emergency calls increased by 34.2% (from 240,878 to 323,155) and the population reduced by 1.4% over the 5-year period. The estimated overall incidence of emergency calls was 96 per 1000 inhabitants per year, which nearly doubled (+45.5%) from 55 calls in 2013 to 102 calls per 1000 inhabitants in 2017. There was an average of 75 rescue vehicles dispatched per 1000 inhabitants per year, with an increase of about 40%, from 59 vehicles dispatched per 1000 inhabitants in 2013 to 83 in 2017. Overall, nearly 90% of the 1,494,855 calls that required the dispatch of at least one rescue vehicle were made by private citizens (Table 1 and Table S1 in Supplementary Materials), two-thirds occurred between 7 a.m. and 6:59 p.m. and 71.6% in working days. The 63.8% were made from a home, although a 2% decrease was observed during the study period. This slight decrease in calls from a home was observed in parallel to a significant slight annual increase in calls from other locations, i.e., nursing homes, private hospitals, and residential care facilities (from 15.3% in 2013 to 16.7% in 2017). Calls from streets or highways or any other location remained stable at around 13%. When looking at the 1,658,728 rescue vehicles dispatched ( Table 2 and Table S2 in Supplementary Materials), around 30% were advanced EMVs, with a slight significant decrease in advanced EMV type 1 vehicles; the remaining were basic EMVs (around 68% of all dispatches), and rescue helicopters significantly increased from 0.4% (95%CI 0.39%-0.44%) in 2013 to 0.7% (95% CI 0.67%-0.72%) in 2017 (see also Supplementary Materials, Table S3 ). The most common rescue completion site was a hospital ED with a slight significant decrease between 2013 (76.6%) and 2017 (73.2%). Nearly a quarter of all dispatched rescue vehicles reported no completion site for one of the following reasons: vehicle failure, patient not found or already transported, site unattainable, or rescue cancellation by the operation centre. Of all dispatches, the range of health problem/injury reported by the caller over the study period remained roughly stable, and traumatic events, cardiocirculatory, neurological, or respiratory problems accounted for the about the 60% of all complaints; ""unclear problems"" represented the 26% of all dispatches without variations between 2013 and 2017. Of all the rescues that ended in a hospital ED (Figure 2 ), Basic EMVs were dispatched more frequently for situations that were given non-urgent criticality codes (from 85.1 to 82.7% among the whole period). Advanced EMVs with a crew of nurses and doctors (type 1), and those with a nurse on board (type 2) were dispatched more frequently for situations that were given urgent criticality codes and around the 10.6% and an average of 15.2%, respectively, for non-urgent cases.

A rescue helicopter was dispatched in more than the 80% of urgent cases. Regression analysis, reported in Table 3 , showed an increased likelihood of rescue completions into a hospital ED in all type of criticality codes for all vehicles with nurse or only volunteers' crew. Basic EMV had a higher likelihood of ending into a hospital ED for non-urgent codes when compared to advanced vehicles type (OR 3.21, 95%CI 3.1-3.3). Helicopter A rescue helicopter was dispatched in more than the 80% of urgent cases. Regression analysis, reported in Table 3 , showed an increased likelihood of rescue completions into a hospital ED in all type of criticality codes for all vehicles with nurse or only volunteers' crew. Basic EMV had a higher likelihood of ending into a hospital ED for non-urgent codes when compared to advanced vehicles type (OR 3.21, 95%CI 3.1-3.3). Helicopter  To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that, using ministerial data, reported attempted characteristics of EMS responses and trends in one of the 20 Italian regions, over a period of 5 years. Previously published studies have been limited to 1-year or to single-city analyses [3, 7] . Based on the available information, the EMUR registry provided a robust representation of EMS use and, despite its deficiencies, it showed to be a valid and suitable tool to allow a comprehensive characterisation of the emergency response system. Our results showed an increase in the EMS use over a 5-years period. This result is supported by previous studies highlighting that the demand of EMS has substantially increased over time in developed countries like Spain [16] , UK [17] , Switzerland [18] , Japan [19] , USA [20] and Australia [21] . These studies have also linked the EMS demand increase to the concurrent population growth. Unfortunately, over the studied period the overall Piedmont population reduced of about 1.4% suggesting that the observed increase in EMS use had to be attributed to others drivers, as the ageing of the population [22, 23] and the increased frailty of the community-dwelling of the older people [24] . Hypothesis which, in this study, can be further supported by the increased trend of dispatches coming from long term care facilities and the higher prevalence of medical conditions and of non-urgent codes. Coherently with other studies, medical problems as cardiocirculatory, neurological, and respiratory, accounted for the largest proportion of EMS intervention requests [25] . Interestingly, given the robustness of our data, although each incoming emergency call is preliminary handled by a highly qualified nurse further supported by a computerised MPSD, ""unclear problems"" accounted for nearly a quarter of the total rescue vehicle dispatched, with little variations by year. Studies on the occurrence of such calls in the EMS are sparse and reported some variations ranging from 11% in Norway [26] , to 18% in Denmark [27] , to nearly 20% (2 million unknown or non-reported complaints over more than 10 million calls) in the USA National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) population [28] . The high occurrence of unclear problems in Italy could be also due to the EMUR registry internal structure, as it uses ICD9 codes to categorize requests, which are meant to diagnose and classify pathologies and may not be accurate enough to identify the callers' complaints in emergency situation. In other contexts, the emergency situation is classified by using a chief complaint classification codes [29, 30] . This approach that is based on specific caller's complaints is likely to be more accurate, as it defines the situation or visible problem as judged on site by a non-professional, resulting in a lower number of unidentified/unclear conditions. Regardless of the reasons, when the cause of a call is reported as unclear, the risk stratification may be less sensitive, leading to the assignment of a higher or lower EMS criticality code than the one needed [29] . This can result in an unnecessary response or in an unmatched response, with more advanced rescue vehicles being sent in basic emergencies, and vice-versa. As a consequence, resultant unneeded EMS transports could affect hospital workloads and reduce the number of cases that could be effectively managed on-site through the dispatch of a more appropriate vehicle. Indeed, Møller (2017) found a higher mortality rate (incidence rate ratio 1.26; 95% confidence interval 1.18-1.36) in patients whose calls were registered as unclear complaints, denoting the need to improve the classification system in order to provide a better, more effective response [27] . Our results showed that the greatest number of calls was from private citizens, the main call location was a private home, occurring in daytime and receiving a low criticality code. Such findings may highlight the existence of problems that could be more effectively managed in primary care, the recurrence of which may also reveal the existence of barriers to primary care services access. Reviews studies on this topic had showed that the lack of a primary care system able to manage primary care sensitive problems were related to an increased EMS services [23, 31] . Due to national indications, the Piedmont health system underwent a heavy spending review from 2010 to 2017 [32] which has hugely affected on the organization of primary care services. The regulatory action has impacted on the number of annual recruitments that, coupled with the increase in the workforce shortage, has dramatically and reduced GPs and nurses' availability and access. Of all the dispatches in the Piedmont Region, more than two third of all dispatches employed Basic EMVs. It is difficult to agree on whether this organisational approach can be considered appropriate or not, without any available standards and since each regional authority is allowed to manage its EMS autonomously. In the Marche Region, for example, advanced EMVs were employed in nearly 70% of emergency calls, while other regions showed overlapping responses to those observed in our study [13] . The EMS system is expected to provide the right answer to the patients' health conditions, transporting only those truly requiring a hospital ED intervention. As the transport is likely to be appropriate in patients receiving an urgent critical code, green codes occurrence should be further analysed. Given that Basic EMVs crew is only allowed to transport patients, calls receiving a non-urgent code can only be dispatched into a hospital ED, independently of the health need. As green codes accounted for nearly 800,000 transports over the 5 years period, the 86% of them had probably contributed to the ED overcrowding. With some exception, a huge proportion of such incoming calls may more effectively managed in a primary care setting than in an emergency department, saving hospital ED time and reducing health system costs [25] . Moreover out-of-hospital EMS reorganization, as for example by providing necessary care on-scene, or by providing advice over the telephone, as occurred in the recent COVID-19 crisis, could contribute to the reduction of unnecessary pressures on ED personnel [33] . The need to further foster primary care is, indeed, supported by the evidence that under the COVID scenario the Italian government (D.L. 14 del 9/3/2020.) intervened in reorganising the EMS system response. To avoid massive ED accesses new pathways of care and professional teams, such as USCA (Special Unit for Continuity of Care), were activated to better respond the health demand and to avoid unnecessary or spontaneous hospital accesses [34] . The main study limitations are those linked to the database that was used and are common to all administrative database studies. Due to the EMUR weaknesses, at present, it is not possible to properly link the EMS registry with hospital health data, which is a critical limitation. Moreover, the EMUR registry does not currently include emergency department information, nor data on patient characteristics, such as age, civil status (alone or cohabiting), symptom information, or medications administered. At the same time, the current EMUR registry database represents the largest, affordable and representative collection of data characterising EMS care in Italy. The Italian health care system is characterized by the universalism of care that is guaranteed to the whole population and therefore the results cannot be generalized to other health care systems.@story_separate@In conclusion, the EMUR registry is useful in characterising EMS systems, level of intervention, and prehospital patient needs. Piedmont regional EMS dispatches mainly Basic EMVs that were employed in low criticality codes or as a support; consequently, these vehicles can only drive the patient to the hospital. Our data showed that, with some exception due to environmental differences, the highest proportion of incoming emergency calls is not acute or urgent and could be more effectively managed in other settings than in an ED. Better management of dispatch can reduce crowding and save hospital emergency departments time, personnel, and health system costs [35, 36] . This data highlights the importance of promoting policies to increase the availability of ambulances with staff who can manage problems on site, reducing the admissions of less appropriate EDs. Moreover, specific procedures to equip EM operating centres in providing updated information on the location and the availability of EMVs fleet, as well as, in receiving indications on the availability of beds in the nearest local hospitals is becoming a priority specifically in densely population regions. Finally, the slight increase in calls coming from nursing homes highlights the need to define priority paths between the local care facilities and the hospitals to reduce ED waiting times.","Background: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) plays a fundamental role in providing good quality healthcare services to citizens, as they are the first responders in distressing situations. Few studies have used available EMS data to investigate EMS call characteristics and subsequent responses. Methods: Data were extracted from the emergency registry for the period 2013–2017. This included call and rescue vehicle dispatch information. All relationships in analyses and differences in events proportion between 2013 and 2017 were tested against the Pearson’s Chi-Square with a 99% level of confidence. Results: Among the 2,120,838 emergency calls, operators dispatched at least one rescue vehicle for 1,494,855. There was an estimated overall incidence of 96 emergency calls and 75 rescue vehicles dispatched per 1000 inhabitants per year. Most calls were made by private citizens, during the daytime, and were made from home (63.8%); 31% of rescue vehicle dispatches were advanced emergency medical vehicles. The highest number of rescue vehicle dispatches ended at the emergency department (74.7%). Conclusions: Our data showed that, with some exception due to environmental differences, the highest proportion of incoming emergency calls is not acute or urgent and could be more effectively managed in other settings than in an Emergency Departments (ED). Better management of dispatch can reduce crowding and save hospital emergency departments time, personnel, and health system costs."
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory disease syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization [1] . A preliminary report warned that SARS-CoV-2 could have neuro-invasive potential as it was observed that some patients showed neurologic symptoms such as headache, nausea, and vomiting [2] . Following early speculation there have been reports of neurologic manifestations involving both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) [3] including reports that COVID-19 may increase the risk of acute ischemic stroke [4] . Here we present the case of a patient with recent COVID-19 infection who experienced low-pressure hydrocephalus requiring high-output cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion following spontaneous angiogram-negative subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).@story_separate@We present the case of a 62-year-old female with a significant past medical history of well-controlled hypertension on monotherapy with metoprolol and a recent symptomatic COVID-19 infection one month prior to admission in early November of 2020 diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction. Her COVID-19 symptoms progressed over the course of around seven to 10 days from generalized malaise to headaches and ultimately intermittent fevers. She did not experience upper respiratory symptoms such as cough or shortness of breath, nor did she experience anosmia. She did not require inpatient admission or specific treatment for her COVID-19 infection. Following recovery from her infection she presented as a transfer to our facility hours after sudden onset of severe headache, nausea, and vomiting while leaning over doing light housework. She decided to seek medical attention for this headache due to the headache severity, stating that it was ""the worst headache of my life."" On arrival to the outside facility her blood pressure was elevated into the 170s systolic requiring treatment with additional anti-hypertensive agents. Radiographically she was found to have diffuse SAH throughout the basilar cisterns, intraventricular hemorrhage, and evidence of hydrocephalus on computed tomography (CT) head without contrast ( Figures  1, 2) . She had no focal neurologic deficits on admission and clinically her grade was categorized as World Federation of Neurologic Surgeon grade 1 and Hunt and Hess grade 2. Radiographically she was classified as Modified Fisher grade 2. An external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed shortly after admission for CSF diversion and was leveled to 15 cm of water (H 2 O). Following placement of the EVD she underwent further diagnostic evaluation with a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head and neck, which was negative for aneurysm, vascular malformation, dissection, or other identifiable etiology for her SAH. Digital subtraction angiography on post-bleed day 1 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on post-bleed day 2 were also negative for identifiable underlying etiology for the SAH. Her mental status progressively declined during the days following admission to the point that she would not open her eyes unless stimulated by noxious stimuli and was completed disoriented, which was noted to be in concordance with progressive increase in ventricular size and trans-ependymal edema ( Figure 3 ) despite CSF diversion by way of a functioning EVD. Her MRI brain demonstrates these findings as well (Figures 4, 5 ). Only once her EVD was progressively lowered to 0 cm H 2 O did her mental status improve and ventricular size begin to decrease on follow-up CT imaging. Her EVD was ultimately successfully weaned and removed on post-bleed day 15 without the need for permanent CSF diversion in the form of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt ( Figure 6 ). Shortly after EVD removal she was discharged home with home health care. She underwent a repeat CTA head and neck prior to discharge, which remained negative for identifiable etiology for her SAH. Her three-month follow-up CTA head and neck remained negative for identifiable aneurysm and otherwise demonstrated complete resolution of intracranial hemorrhage and no evidence of delayed hydrocephalus.  SAH is a common problem encountered by neurosurgeons. The estimated annual incidence of spontaneous SAH in the United States is 9.7-14.5 per 100,000 [5, 6] . Spontaneous, non-traumatic SAH is most commonly caused by saccular aneurysms with arteriovenous malformations, arterial dissections, tumors, and other vascular abnormalities such as vasculitis causing SAH in the minority of cases [7] . Occasionally, no structural etiology for the SAH can be identified on radiographic imaging. These hemorrhages, termed idiopathic SAH or angiogram-negative SAH, represent approximately 15% of spontaneous SAH [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The incidence of patients requiring CSF diversion in angiogram-negative SAH is around 15.6% with 5.6% of patients requiring permanent CSF diversion in the form of a shunt [14] . We present a case of angio-negative SAH with significantly altered CSF mechanics following a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) is a critical step in the pathophysiology of clinical manifestations in patients with COVID-19 [15] . The function of ACE2 in normal human physiology is to regulate blood pressure via inhibition of the angiotensin-renin-aldosterone pathways [15] . ACE2 has a wide distribution in multiple organs including the nose, lungs, kidneys, liver, blood vessels, immune system, and the brain [16] . After binding to ACE2, downstream effects can include damage to mitochondria and lysosomes resulting in protein misfolding, protein aggregation, and cell death [17] . By SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2, it can inhibit the metabolic conversion of angiotensin-2 to angiotensin-1, resulting in higher levels of pro-inflammatory markers, vasoconstriction, vascular permeability, edema, and vascular injury [17] . Following early speculation there have been reports of neurologic manifestations involving both the CNS and PNS [3] . Cytokine activation in the CNS can result in small and large vessel occlusions, leading to acute ischemic stroke or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis if in an artery or vein/sinus, respectively [17] . Additionally, cytokine activation can result in damage to the blood-brain barrier and injure neuroglia once infiltrated into the CNS either directly or as a result of formation of autoantibodies by a mechanism known as molecular mimicry [17] . We hypothesize that patients who are either currently or who have recently been infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have altered ventricular compliance and/or altered CSF hydrodynamics from mechanisms that are not yet understood but are potentially related to one or multiple of the aforementioned mechanisms. There have been reports of both spontaneous non-aneurysmal as well as spontaneous aneurysmal SAH in patients acutely infected with COVID-19 [18, 19] . To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous non-aneurysmal SAH with associated low-pressure hydrocephalus in the setting of recent COVID-19 infection. It is possible that the correlation is merely coincidental; however, it is difficult to know with certainty as the neurologic manifestations related to COVID-19 continue to grow in the literature. We, therefore, saw it to be prudent to report our findings. We did not send CSF in our case as our facility's laboratory was not equipped to run COVID-19 testing on CSF samples. It has been suggested, however, that the current testing of COVID-19 in CSF may not be an accurate marker for neurologic manifestations in the setting of COVID-19 as only around 6% of patients with acute COVID-19 infection and neurologic manifestations had CSF that tested positive for COVID-19 [20] . This potentially suggests that more accurate CSF biomarkers need to be developed to detect COVID-19 or the neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 act in a route that is not directly involved in the CSF but may still have implications on CSF hydrodynamics. For similar patients with non-aneurysmal SAH with low-pressure hydrocephalus, we would recommend follow-up in three months with a repeat CTA head/neck in search of etiology for SAH as well as to follow up on hydrocephalus. Consideration could also be given to involving infectious disease and potentially obtaining a CSF sample if testing is immediately available at the provider's institution.

There have been multiple reports of COVID-19 resulting in CNS manifestations. The mechanism and inflammatory reaction resulting from SARS-CoV-2 resulting in other neurologic manifestations may also contribute to alterations in CSF hydrodynamics leading to a new set of therapeutic challenges in SAH management.","A preliminary report warned that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could have neuro-invasive potential as it was observed that some patients showed neurologic symptoms such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Following early speculation there have been reports of neurologic manifestations involving both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system including reports that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may increase the risk of acute ischemic stroke. Here we present a patient with recent COVID-19 infection who experienced low-pressure hydrocephalus requiring high-output cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion following spontaneous angiogram-negative subarachnoid hemorrhage. We hypothesize that patients who are either currently or who have recently been infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have altered ventricular compliance and/or altered CSF hydrodynamics from mechanisms that are not yet understood but potentially related to previously described pathophysiologic mechanisms of the virus and associated inflammatory reaction."
"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus infectious disease has been prevalent in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread globally to become a pandemic [1] . This disease, caused by the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) by World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 has seriously affected the quality of life, which further causes great economic, social and family burden. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of COVID-19 from the SARS-CoV-2 infection to cytokine storm-mediated organ failure will provide us with extremely valuable information to overcome COVID-19. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), the nanoscale bilayer vesicles that can be released by virtually all eukaryotic cells, have emerged as an essential intercellular communicator [2, 3] . By horizontally transferring biomolecules like nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, EVs can regulate physiological and pathological processes of the recipient cells [2, [4] [5] [6] . Mounting evidence has implicated EVs in the pathogenesis and treatment of various lung diseases including COVID-19 [3, 7] . For example, primed macrophage-derived EVs facilitate the influx of inflammatory cells into the lung, leading to cytokine storms and acute lung injury [8] . In this review, we firstly discuss the epidemiology, symptoms and pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its complications, together with the biogenesis, composition and origins of lung EVs. We then provide a comprehensive summarization for the roles of EVs in the infection of SARS-CoV-2, the progression of cytokine storm and the treatment of COVID-19.@story_separate@COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has spread globally and been accepted as a pandemic after initially occurring in China in December 2019. Till February 13th 2021, a total of 107,423,526 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide including 2,360,280 deaths, based on the record released from WHO (https://covid 19.who.int/). The epidemic situation in China has been controlled except for sporadic cases. Unfortunately, new cases are being reported at increasing rates globally, and 83 countries, territories and areas had more than 100,000 cases. The largest number of confirmed cases is from the United States to this date. Given the severity of COVID-19, it is urgently needed to develop therapeutics or vaccines to treat or prevent the pandemic. Until now, there are no effective drugs to treat COVID-19 [9] . Encouragingly, based on WHO's record on February 13th 2021, more than 60 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in clinical development, which may save millions of lives in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly through different routes including droplets and close contact [10] . Among various viral transmission modes, the weight, from large to small, may be droplets, aerosol, fomite and faecal-oral route transmission. The majority of COVID-19 cases develop a respiratory tract infection. Then, SARS-CoV-2 spreads by means of the respiratory tract, via droplets and respiratory secretions through coughing/sneezing and/or direct contact with infected individual. SARS-CoV-2 survives for several hours/days on different surfaces and persists in the air after an aerosolization process for distant transmission (over two metres), which further increases its infection risk [11] . Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can be spread from asymptomatic cases, minimally symptomatic patients with high titres of viral load on pharyngeal samples during the initial days of the disease, and even patients on clinical recovery [12] . Therefore, densely populated areas or hospitals are the places with the highest viral transmission rate. Healthy and immunosuppressed population are similarly susceptible upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [12, 13] . The median age of patients was 59 years ranging from 15 to 89 years, and more than half of them were males [13] . People with low immune function particularly the elderly and those with renal and hepatic dysfunction are a higher risk group for severe COVID-19 [14, 15] . Children have a milder disease course and better prognosis than adults [13, 16] . SARS-CoV-2 infects the lower airway respiratory tract and causes pneumonia that appears milder than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection [17] . But it may lead to fatal acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in nearly 10%-20% of the cases, resulting in death within a short time [17] . The time period from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to death ranged from 6 to 41 days with a medium of 14 days [1] . This time period is dependent on the patient's immune system and age. The incubation period was shorter among patients over 70 years of age and with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma, hypertension or diabetes [18] . A large proportion of the patients show mild symptoms and recover on their own. About 22% of the patients develop severe symptoms, and the incidence of critically severe illness was about 10·5% [15] . Another study reported that about 16% of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [19] . The most common symptoms at the onset of infection are malaise, dry cough and high fever as well as other symptoms including lymphopenia, diarrhoea, haemoptysis, headache, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, sore throat and loss of taste or smell [18] . Once developed into severe pneumonia, COVID-19 patients can have ARDS and changes in heart and liver function as a secondary or related consequence of disease, which could lead to multiple organ failures and death. These aforementioned severe symptoms may stay weeks in such patients. Taken together, the time period of COVID-19 symptoms can be approximately divided into three phases: (a) early infection phase: fever, dry cough, diarrhoea and headache; (b) pulmonary phase: shortness of breath and hypoxia; and (c) hyperinflammation phase: ARDS, shock and MODS [20] . Belonging to Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV-2 is enveloped non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. So far, coronaviruses are the largest known RNA viruses. The viral particles display a rough spherical or multifaceted crystal shape. The surface has prominent club-shaped projections composed of its structural protein and inside is the viral genome wrapped in a nucleocapsid [21, 22] . Viral genomes contain a 5' cap and 3' poly(A) tail. Approximately one-thirds of the 3' end RNA sequence encodes four core structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Approximately two-thirds of the viral genome capacity (the 5' cap) is composed of ORF1a and ORF1b and encodes nonstructural replicase/transcriptase [21, 22] . S protein is a trimeric glycoprotein with S1 and S2 functional domains. S1 together with the receptor-binding domain initiates the viral entry. S2, containing amino acid sequences of viral infectivity, induces the fusion between cytomembrane and viral membranes during endocytosis. E protein is a non-glycosylated transmembrane protein found in small quantities, which facilitates the assembly and the budding process. M protein is the most abundant membrane protein on the viral particle, which contributes to the shaping and maturation of the virion. N protein, containing a C-terminal domain and an N-terminal domain, participates in RNA genome encapsulation and replication via direct binding with viral RNA [23] . Besides the four main structural proteins, there are sixteen nonstructural proteins (NSP) in SARS-CoV-2. They display diverse functions majorly in regulating viral replication-transcription machinery [24] . SARS-CoV-2 enters the host alveoli via the respiratory tract. Inside the alveoli, SARS-CoV-2 infection is robust in type II pneumocytes expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a type I integral membrane protein of renin-angiotensin systems that control cardiac and kidney functions [25, 26] . Growing evidence has pointed out ACE2 as the pivot receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection [26] . Both SARS-CoV (glutamine 479 in the receptor-binding domain) and SARS-CoV-2 (glutamine 394 in the receptor-binding domain) can bind to lysine 31 on the human ACE2 with high affinity [27] . In addition, SARS-CoV-2 may be more efficient than SARS-CoV in the perspective of human ACE2 recognition, increasing the spreading ability of SARS-CoV-2 among people. [27] The interaction of trimeric SARS-CoV-2 fusion protein (the S1 domain of S protein) with the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 recruits transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to cleave the S1/S2 site of ACE2 (C-terminal segment residues 697 to 716), thus enhancing viral entry [25] . Once SARS-CoV-2 is endocytosed into cell cytoplasm, its lipid bilayers are disassembled by lysosomal enzymes of type II pneumocytes. Afterwards, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes host cell RNA polymerase to replicate viral single-stranded RNA, increasing the viral load within the host cell. Ribosomes of the host cell are also used to translate viral RNA into structural framework polyproteins [28] . These polyproteins can use host enzymes, such as proteinases, to further proteolyse themselves into S, E, M, and N proteins [28] . Structural proteins, together with viral RNAs, form mature SARS-CoV-2 that buds off the type II pneumocyte to get into the alveolus. This forms a vicious circle and aggravates the course of COVID-19. Besides type II alveolar epithelial cells, single-cell RNAsequencing analyses also identified the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cardiomyocytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, renal tubular and intestinal epithelial cells [29] . The high expression of ACE2 augments SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung, heart and small intestine that explains the pathophysiology of acute lung and myocardial injury, and gastrointestinal symptoms reported in COVID-19 cases. The budding off of SARS-CoV-2 leads to the destruction of host cells like the type II pneumocytes, which induces the release of various inflammatory mediators that stimulate alveolar macrophages. Activated macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [12, 30] . After entering the vascular system, these cytokines cause smooth muscle dilation and blood vessel endothelial cell contraction, collectively increasing capillary permeability [31] . As a consequence, plasma from the blood vessel leaks into the interstitial spaces and causes alveolar oedema. The rapid increase of blood cytokines and chemokines also attracts many inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes, to lung tissue, resulting in inflammatory cells influx. Through stimulation of interferon (IFN) receptors, the accumulating inflammatory cells produce monocyte chemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL7, CCL12) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-6, IL-1β), leading to further accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory cells [32] . While fighting viral pathogens, the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by neutrophils and monocytes in patients' lung tissues and peripheral blood forms cytokine storm to attack more healthy cells [30] . The mass damage of type I and II pneumocytes also reduces the production of surfactant, which increases the surface tension within alveolus, contributing to alveolar collapse and alveolar oedema [31] . This alveolar collapse impairs gas exchange and leads to refractory hypoxemia. Peripheral chemoreceptors, triggered by hypoxemia, cause the sympathetic nervous system to increase respiration and heart rate to compensate the shortened gas exchange. With decreased partial pressure of oxygen, patient's breathing becomes increasingly difficult, resulting in ARDS. Moreover, vascular cytokines can reach the central nervous system, especially the hypothalamus that is responsible for maintaining body temperature. The excessive IL-1 and IL-6 within the hypothalamus increase the production of prostaglandins that elevates the core body temperature to initiate fever. Excess cytokines that circulate through the vascular system can also be taken up by other tissue and trigger systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [12, 30] . Vascular cytokine-mediated capillary hyperpermeability induces plasma to deposits within tissues other than lung, therefore decreasing the blood volume. The vasodilation decreases the total peripheral resistance and reduces blood pressure significantly, which results in exhausted perfusion and ultimately leads to multi-system organ failure (MSOF) [30] . The decreased perfusion to kidneys increases the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, leading to acute renal injury. Besides ARDS and MSOF, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been identified as a severe complication in some COVID-19 cases and an intermediate segment in the development of MSOF [33] . Emerging evidence implicates EVs as an important intercellular communicator [4] . EVs are detected in cell culture supernatants and in virtually all biological fluids such as blood, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), urine, cerebral spinal fluid, breastmilk and ascites [2] . As one of the hottest topics of the basic and clinical research, the biogenesis, composition and origins of EVs are under comprehensive investigation, leading to rapid expansion of our knowledge in disciplines aforementioned. Based on their biological characteristics, EVs are generally separated into three main classes including exosomes, microvesicles (MVs) and apoptotic bodies ( Figure 1 ) [34, 35] . Exosomes are the smallest type of EVs (30-150 nm) and are characterized by their endosomal origin [2, 36] . The biogenesis of exosomes initiates from the formation of early endosomes (EEs). EEs mature into late endosomes that are also known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs). MVBs' membrane buds inwardly to form intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). Then, MVBs can be guided to lysosomes for degradation or fuse with plasma membrane under the regulation of Rab GTPases and SNARE proteins. ILVs that are released into extracellular milieu via secretory pathway are referred to as exosomes. The unique origin of exosomes determines that exosomes are enriched with endosomal markers, including tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD82), heat-shock proteins (Hsc70 and Hsp90), ALG-2-interacting protein X (Alix), tumour susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes I and II [34] . MVs (previously named as microparticles) have sizes between 100 and 2000 nm in diameter and are generated via direct outward budding of the plasma membrane [34] . MVs contain membrane components that are similar to that of the parent cell membrane-like selectins, integrins, CD40 ligand, flotillin-2 and adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) [37] . Although the biogenesis of EVs is not fully understood, reports claimed that MVs may be released under stimulation, while exosomes are generally secreted in a continuous manner [38] [39] [40] . Apoptotic bodies are the largest class of EVs with sizes of 1-4 μm in diameter [34] . Unlike exosomes and MVs that are secreted by cells under various conditions, apoptotic bodies are only released by cells undergoing apoptosis [34] . Apoptotic bodies are produced by cell membrane-blebbing during the systematic breakdown of apoptotic cells. Thus, the biogenesis of apoptotic bodies may share secretory pathways with MVs, but only apoptotic bodies contain fragmented nucleus and organelles [34] . It is worth noting that the majority of functional studies of EVs exclude apoptotic bodies, as they neither reflect most physiological and pathological status states of parent cells, nor undertake normal intercellular communication [4, 35] . After being released into the microenvironment, EVs fuse with the plasma membrane of target cells directly, be internalized by recipient cells via endocytosis or phagocytosis or bind to target cells through ligand-receptor interactions [2, 34] . These vesicles therefore mediate cell-to-cell communication by transferring bioactive molecules into recipient cells or regulating the downstream signal cascades of activated receptors on target cells. EVs contain multiple types of functionally relevant biomolecules including proteins and peptides (e.g., endosomeassociated proteins, membrane proteins and lipid raft proteins), nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, mRNA and non-coding RNA) and lipids. The contents of EVs vary with the origins and the pathophysiological states of parent cells. For example, although both lung epithelial cells and macrophages secret EVs enriched with cytokines and other inflammatory proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs) [41] , EVs derived from both types of cells can be separated by the surface proteins of lung epithelial cells (e.g., pulmonary surfactant proteins and caveolin-1) and macrophages (e.g., Ly-6G/Ly-6C) [42] . Similarly, EVs derived from other types of lung cells can also be identified by their unique surface markers. Besides, distinct membrane proteins are also present on exosomes and MVs. Transferrin receptors are highly enriched in exosomes, while vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (Vamp3) is predominantly expressed in the MVs [34] . Therefore, even though exosomes and MVs are similar in density and size that make it difficult to separate them by ultracentrifugation, the current gold standard for EV purification, different types of EVs released by various cells can be distinguished by detecting specific surface markers. To only understand the function of mixed exosome population in biological fluids, no longer satisfies the requirement of current research. It is important to figure out the origins of EVs and investigate the roles of cell-specific EVs under various physiological and pathological conditions. In the perspectives of lung disease diagnosis and their pathogenesis research, blood (plasma or serum) and BALF are the most commonly used ones for EV isolation. As one of the easiest accessible biological fluids, plasma/serum is enriched with EVs. However, the origins of blood EVs are difficult to trace since EVs can be released by virtually all tissues and cells in the human body. Thus, BALF is a better source for isolating lung cell-derived EVs. With the help of the surface marker screen mentioned above, the origins of BALF EVs can be distinguished. Mounting studies demonstrated that pulmonary EVs can be released from many types of cells, including but not limited to lung epithelial cells, endothelial cells, alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes fibroblasts. Among them, epithelial cells and macrophages are the two main contributors of BALF EVs [43] . More importantly, mounting studies have revealed that the cellular origins of EVs vary in response to different pathological stimulations. In normal conditions without noxious stimuli, alveolar macrophages are the major source of BALF EVs [44] . Sterile stimuli, such as the exposure of oxidative stress or acid inhalation, cause diffuse alveolar cell damage. The perturbation of cell homeostasis induces robust EVs release from lung epithelial cells (e.g., alveolar type-I epithelial cells) but not other types of cells in the lung. Thus, the majority of the BALF EVs are derived from lung epithelial cells under sterile stimuli till lung injury induces strong inflammatory response [42] . In contrast, infectious stimuli, such as bacterial and viral infection, activate alveolar macrophages, the first responder to infection, to trigger extensive pro-inflammatory responses. Once activated, the EV generation capacity of macrophages increases dramatically. Alveolar macrophages, therefore, act as the main contributor to BALF EVs [42] . Interestingly, the type of noxious stimuli and the severity of diseases also influence the type of EVs detected in BALF. Multiple independent groups observed that MVs are the dominant type of EVs in BALF after hyperoxia or acid exposure [44, 45] . Both nanotracking analysis (NTA) and western blotting results suggested that MVs contribute to more than half of BALF EVs, especially in the early phase of sterile stimuli exposure. This situation also applies to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary inflammation [46] . Taken together, EVs in BALF and other biological fluids are highly heterogeneous and dynamic. With the rapid development of technologies in high-throughput screening  The contribution of EVs to infectious disease including COVID-19 is a newly developed topic. For example, antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have been found to exhibit antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 via blocking EV release, endocytosis and phagolysosomal fusion in vitro [47, 48] . Those in vitro studies have indicated EVs as a key mediator of SARS-CoV-19 infection, although following clinical trials have implied that CQ or HCQ may not bring prominent benefits to COVID-19 patients but cause potential harm [49] . Current studies have revealed two main mechanisms for EV-mediated viral infection (Figure 2a) . First, EVs carry host proteins that make recipient cells more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 requires multiple steps including ACE2-mediated receptor-binding and TMPRSS2-mediated intracellular cleavage. Recent studies identified ACE2 in EVs and demonstrated the transfer of ACE2 among various types of cells via EVs [50] . It implies that SARS-CoV-2 may utilize a similar strategy to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), another type of RNA virus, regarding to virus internalization, in which SARS-CoV-2 enters target cells via binding to exosomal ACE2 [50] . Moreover, this finding has inspired a competitive inhibition therapy against SARS-CoV-2, which uses ACE2-expressing EVs to occupy SARS-CoV-2 S protein S1 domain in a competitive manner, therefore protecting ACE2-expressing cells from viral infection [51] . Another mechanism for EV-mediated viral entry involves one of the most abundantly expressed proteins on the surface of EVs, tetraspanin CD9 [2] . It is reported that CD9 and TMPRSS2 work together in cleaving viral fusion glycoproteins and facilitate a quick entry coronavirus (e.g., MERS-CoV) into lung cells [52] . Besides, CD9 also accelerates lentiviral infection and enhances transduction efficiency in immune responsible cells including B cells and T lymphocytes [53] . These observations reveal that CD9 and other tetraspanins on exosomal surface may be a mediator in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Besides ACE2 and tetraspanins, other host proteins on EVs also participate in infection. For example, coronavirus employs caveolin-1-dependent endocytosis for cell entry [54] . This entry is dynamin-dependent, which requires actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. Since caveolin-1 is present in lung epithelial cells and EVs are derived from these cells, EVs caveolin-1 may play a supportive role for SARS-CoV-2 infection by spreading this protein in vivo. Second, EVs may mediate the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 particles or components directly. Previous studies have demonstrated that circulating exosomes isolated from lung transplant recipients diagnosed with the infection of respiratory viruses including rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus contained viral antigens [55] . Additionally, by the ectopic expression in EV-secreting cells (e.g., T293 cells), S protein can be loaded into EVs, which facilitates the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with target cells [56] . These observations imply that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells produce EVs containing virus particles, which accelerate the spreading of virus or exacerbate the host immune response, leading to cytokine storm. This premise is confirmed by multiple studies. For example, through transducing the selected genes of the SARS-CoV-2 into lung epithelial cells, EVs derived from transduced cells contain viral RNA [57] . Cardiomyocytes are able to internalize these EVs and take in these viral contents, which subsequently leads to an up-regulation of inflammation-related genes [57] . Although our knowledge about the roles of EVs in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains limited, numerous studies on RNA virus in general and coronavirus in particular offer important prompts in decrypting the molecular mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and spreading, and further suggesting directions in developing effective therapeutic strategies. As we described above, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 per se is not fatal, and the cytokine storm-mediated ARDS and other complications are the main causes of death in COVID-19. Therefore, the investigation of EVs' involvement in cytokine storm has emerged as an essential research field. The studies that explore the pro-inflammatory roles of EVs in the lung started from the quantification of EVs among donors with cytokine storm/ARDS and their corresponding controls. It is reported that higher concentrations of MVs were detected in pulmonary oedema fluid (PEF) collected from patients with ARDS, compared with a control group of patients with hydrostatic pulmonary oedema [58] . Following studies demonstrated that EVs in BALF derived from LPS-induced cytokine storm models were able to initiate inflammatory responses in the lung. These EVs were taken by mouse epithelial cells MLE12 and enhanced the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and junction proteins in the latter in vitro [59] . Another group showed that after being incubated with LPS-treated BALF EVs, MLE12 expressed higher levels of ICAM-1 and keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC) [46] . More importantly, in LPS-induced mouse lung inflammation model, the administration of GW4869 significantly decreased lung elastance, reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and impaired alveolar collapse [60] . Similar results were obtained when applying GW4869 in asthmatic inflammatory conditions [43] . These functional studies demonstrate great potential of EVs in initiating and aggravating cytokine storm. Furthermore, the pro-inflammatory effects of EVs derived from individual types of lung cells have been investigated. [61] . When treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ), alveolar epithelial cells secrete abundant MVs containing procoagulant tissue factor (TF), which participates in fibrin deposition in ARDS [58] . The mechanisms of epithelial cell-derived EV-mediated inflammatory response have been explored. Under oxidative stress and acid inhalation, epithelial cell-derived EVs can be internalized by alveolar macrophages and enhance the production of TNFα, IL-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) in the latter [62] . These EVs also robustly increase macrophage and neutrophil influxes in lung tissue [62] . Epithelial cellderived EVs transfer certain miRNAs (miR-221 and miR-320a) into macrophages and in this way upregulate the integrin β1-mediated macrophage/neutrophil extravasation and migration into inflammation sites [62] . Unlike the situation of sterile stimuli, the effects of epithelial cell-derived EVs under infectious stimuli remain largely unknown. This knowledge gap needs to be filled urgently in order to fight against SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. Macrophages are the first responders to viral infection among all immunoregulatory cells and are therefore strongly associated with cytokine storm in the lung. We, together with others, have demonstrated that macrophages secrete large amounts of EVs when treated with LPS or infected with viruses [41, 63] . The characterization analyses of EVs showed that the majority of MVs in BALF of mouse challenged with i.t. LPS for 1 h are derived from alveolar macrophages [46] . In vitro studies suggest that MVs released from LPSprimed alveolar macrophages induce immune response of epithelial cells including the expression of the inflammatory protein ICAM-1 [46] . Post-intravenous administration, LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophage-derived EVs cause cytokine storm-like phenotypes including the elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, the infiltration of immune cells, haemorrhage, interstitial and alveolar oedema and the thickness of alveolar septum [8] . Composition analyses identified that various pro-inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α and glutaminase (GLS), are massively packaged into these EVs [46, 63] . TNF-α in macrophage-derived EVs activates NF-κB in lung epithelial cells, thus leading to the overproduction of interleukin 8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) [64] . IL-8 and MCP1 attract neutrophils and monocytes to pulmonary tissue, which, in turn, causes cytokine storm. GLS, delivered by EVs, can also activate macrophages via dysregulating cellular metabolic activities, such as the abnormal accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [41, 63, 65] . Besides, multiple pro-inflammatory miRNAs are also enriched in EVs originated from LPSprimed macrophages/microglia [41, 66, 67] . Thus, although we are still in lack of evidence for the roles of macrophagederived EVs in COVID-19 cytokine storm, data obtained in LPS-stimulated model indicate these EVs as a key factor in lung inflammation and injury. Except for macrophages, neutrophils are important mediators in inflammatory responses. Neutrophil influx into pulmonary tissue has been regarded as a key step of cytokine storm. As we described above, many studies have focused on the effects of EVs originated from epithelial cells or macrophages on the infiltration of neutrophils, but the function of neutrophil-derived EVs is largely unknown. In 2019, Genschmer et al. demonstrated that neutrophil activated by bacterial formylated peptide (a canonical PMN stimulant) formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP) released EVs with high neutrophil elastase (NE) activity [68] . These EVs caused emphysema when administered into murine lungs via NE-mediated degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Furthermore, Rossaint et al. [69] found that platelets interacted with intravascular neutrophils through P-selectin/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1)mediated binding and enhanced the generation of EVs from the latter. Neutrophil-derived EVs induce the synthesis of thromboxane A2 (TxA2) in platelets, which further increases endothelial ICAM-1 expression. The presence of endothelial ICAM-1 recruits neutrophils, intensifying inflammatory responses of the lung. Additionally, EVs derived from LPS-stimulated neutrophils can enhance the proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). The excessive generation of ASMCs thickens airway wall and contributes to lung inflammation [70] . These studies indicate that neutrophil-derived EVs may be widely associated with COVID-19 cytokine storm by facilitating neutrophil infiltration, inducing lung injury and developing exuberant inflammation. Endothelial cells are another type of cells associated with cytokine storm and ARDS. Endothelial injury can cause severe sequelae of pulmonary capillary leak, microvascular thrombosis and physiologic shunt. Endothelial cells release EVs robustly under cytokine stimulation, starvation, mechanical ventilation or cigarette smoke [71, 72] . These EVs cause attenuation of endothelium-mediated vasodilation and a significant rise in pulmonary capillary permeability by smothering NO release [71] . The compromise of the endothelial-alveolar barrier recruits neutrophil and triggers strong inflammatory response. Endothelial cell-derived EVs can also be internalized by macrophages, leading to the dysfunction of the latter [72] . Besides aforementioned cell types, EVs derived from other cells such as red blood cells are also involved in neutrophil priming and other key steps of the development of cytokine storm [73] . Although the exact roles of EVs in COVID-19 cytokine storm remain largely unknown, current findings suggest that the excessive production of pro-inflammatory EVs is an indispensable link in the chain reaction of cytokine storm, implying EVs as a promising therapeutic target in treating cytokine storms in COVID-19. Growing studies implicate cargos in biological fluid-isolated EVs as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of diverse diseases [2] . The possibility for recruiting EVs in COVID-19 diagnosis is also under meticulous examination. Goodlet et al. analysed the contents of serum EVs isolated from a COVID-19 patient [74] . Before infection, no viral protein could be detected in circulating EVs, while SARS-CoV-2 S protein could be found in EVs after the patient contracted SARS-CoV-2. Post-infectious symptom resolution, viral proteins could no longer be identified in serum EVs. This work indicates the feasibility of EV-based COVID-19 diagnosis, although more work remains to be done including the screening of viral molecules in a larger number of samples, the specificity/sensitivity validation of identified diagnostic index candidates and the development of simple and inexpensive EV cargo detection methods. Furthermore, EVs in peripheral blood may also be used as prognostic markers for COVID-19 [75] . COVID-19-induced endothelial cell damage promotes EV release and is also likely to contribute to prothrombotic environment [76, 77] . The release of endothelial cell-derived EVs with surfacebound coagulation factors (prothrombin and factors VII, IX and X) and von Willebrand factor (VWF) can result in COVID-related deaths through venous thromboembolism. Since these EVs are only secreted from damaged endothelial cells to peripheral blood, they could be used for COVID-19 severity classification, suggesting the clinical application of EVs in COVID-19 prognosis in treatment. EVs are emerging as a potential alternative of the whole cell-based therapy. The advantages of EVs include ease of access, lower risk of tumorigenesis and possibility for longterm storage [2] . More importantly, EVs possess bilayer phospholipid membrane, which protects their contents from degradation and facilitates their fusing with target cells. To date, many animal studies and clinical trials have been carried out to examine the therapeutic effects of EVs in human diseases. Inspiringly, by modifying the origins, composition and administration approaches, EVs achieve promising treatment outcome in various lung diseases including COVID-19 ( Figure 2b ) [78] . Now in the field of COVID-19 therapeutic strategy development, EVs derived from stem cells, especially mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs), attracted great attention [79] . MSCs are multipotent cells that play an irreplaceable role in the pathogenesis and recovery of multiple inflammatory diseases, with their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties [80] . A great number of studies have demonstrated the promising therapeutic outcome of MSC-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) treatment in various models of pneumonia. Therefore, MSC-EVs have been considered as a promising candidate for therapeutics in combating COVID-19 [79, 81] . Currently, multiple clinical trials have been registered on clinicaltrials.gov and at least one clinical trial was finished in which severe COVID-19 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS received a single 15 ml intravenous dose of ExoFlo™, a MSC-derived exosome agent [82] . The clinical safety is confirmed. Patients' clinical states and oxygenation were improved, accompanied with a decline of absolute neutrophil counts, a rise of lymphocyte counts and a reduction of acute phase reactants (e.g., C-reactive protein, ferritin and Ddimer) after one treatment. The therapeutic effects of MSC-EVs in COVID-19 are highly likely mediated by transferring protective and antiinflammatory RNAs and proteins among damaged or activated cells in pulmonary tissue [2, [83] [84] [85] . MSC-EVs are highly enriched with multiple miRNAs (e.g., let-7 [83] , miR-124-3p [2] , miR-21-5p [84] , miR-146a [2] and miR-145 [85] ). miR-124-3p can repress oxidative stress and cytokine expression by directly binding to purinergic receptor P2X ligand-gated ion channel 7 (P2X7) or regulating Toll-like receptor-related genes [2] . miR-21-5p suppresses lung cell apoptosis via inhibiting PTEN and PDCD4 [84] . miR-146a shifts the phenotypes of macrophage from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory via repressing Nf-κb signalling pathway [2] . miR-145 significantly enhances the phagocytic capacity of macrophages to accelerate microbial clearance [85] . Therefore, although EV-based therapy is a new topic, current knowledge has implicated MSC-EVs as a promising 'medicine' in treating COVID-19 through the manipulation of the complicated immunomodulatory network. Substantial efforts are now warranted to ensure the robustness and reliability. Besides MSC-EVs, EVs derived from other sources also exhibit potentials in treating ARDS. For instance, unstimulated neutrophil-derived EVs play an anti-inflammatory role on alveolar epithelial cells through miR-223-mediated PARP-1 inhibition during acute lung injury [86] . Our understanding for the therapeutic potential of these EVs remain extremely narrow, comprehensive investigation, therefore, is required before we come to a definite conclusion. Moreover, EVs derived from specific types of immune cells or equipped with viral or antiviral components may be used as therapeutic drugs to treat COVID-19 directly. For example, a currently active clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04389385) plans to use SARS-CoV-2 specific fragment peptide-activated T-cell-derived EVs to treat early-stage COVID-19. These EVs may contain potent mediators including IFN-γ that control disease progression effectively. Besides, EVs may hinder SARS-CoV-2 infection via directly interacting with viruses or protecting susceptible cells from viral recognition [51, 87] . Since recombinant soluble ACE2 proteins can block SARS-CoV-2 infection by competitively inhibiting the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2-expressing cells in vitro [88, 89] , EVs equipped with ACE2 may limit the progression of viral infection in vivo [51, 87] . This scenario has been partially proved by Coffey's group [90] . They observed that EVs containing ACE2 bound SARS-CoV-2 through the virus S protein, indicating engineered EVs as a promising therapy for blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Another approach, reported by O'Driscoll et al., suggests that MSC-EVs decorated with S proteins can occupy ACE2 on alveolar type II cells, competing against SARS-CoV-2 for cellular uptake and protecting cells from viral infection [91] . Therefore, many EV-based therapies have been proposed or studied for treating COVID-19. With comprehensive investigations, engineered EVs can play a huge role in the combat against COVID-19 and probably other infectious diseases. Besides therapeutics, vaccines that control SARS-CoV-2 are also urgently needed due to the current COVID-19 pandemic [92] . Currently, multiple clinical trials that utilize lipid nanoparticles encapsulated with mRNAs (e.g., mRNA-1273, BNT162b1, CVnCoV) and saRNAs (e.g., LNP-nCoVsaRNA) are already carried out in Germany, Belgium and the United States [93] . Being natural nanoscale vesicles with lipid bilayer membrane, EVs are also contemplated as new and novel avenues for vaccine development [94, 95] . EVs interact extensively with immune cells and activate the latter, thereby priming the immune responses to recognize and kill specific types of cells [96] . For example, EVs isolated from malignant effusions of three patients with papillary adenocarcinoma kill tumour cells by inducing dendritic cells to prime T lymphocytes via a MHC I-dependent mechanism [97] . Furthermore, Kuate and colleagues generated SARS-CoV S protein-decorated EVs that facilitate the B-cell receptor cross-linking and elevate neutralizing antibody titres in mice to a level higher than that in the convalescent serum of SARS patients [56] . This finding implies that EVs containing SARS-CoV-2 components may work as a vaccine for COVID-19. Although we are in lack of evidence to consider EVs as SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, developing EV-based nanoscale therapeutic vaccine is an important and interesting direction to go. Growing studies have demonstrated EVs as promising natural carriers for drug loading and delivery due to multiple superiorities, such as high biocompatibility profile, long half-life in | 11 vivo and the capability to cross biological barriers [81, 98, 99] . EV-based delivery is utilized in treating various lung diseases. Post-i.t., MyD88 siRNA-or miR-223/142-loaded EVs inhibit NF-κb signalling pathway or Nlrp3 inflammasome activation, respectively, in alveolar macrophages, leading to the suppression of lung inflammation [67, 100] . In the perspective of COVID-19 treatment, EV-based drug delivery is also under heated discussion [47] . For instance, by modifying surface molecules, EVs can be conferred with the capacity to target SARS-CoV-2-infected cells/tissues [99] . Homing molecules (e.g., nano/antibodies, DNA aptamer and peptides) that specifically target caveolin-1 or Ly-6G may guide EVs to lung epithelial cells or macrophages, respectively, and deliver anti-inflammatory medicines to stifle cytokine storm in COVID-19 [42, 99] . Other than the expression of cellspecific ligands on the surface of EVs, the assembly of viral proteins that are involved in the targeting recognition onto EVs is another promising approach to achieve targeted delivery [101] . For example, EVs derived from SARS-CoV-2 model cell lines (e.g., Vero CCL-81 or Vero E6) contain surface proteins that recognize SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolar macrophages, implying that these EVs can deliver encapsulated drugs to the focus of infection [101] . Therefore, clinical trials for repurposing aforementioned drugs in COVID-19 through EV-based delivery can be very rapid, as these drugs are FDA-approved and EVs are widely used natural nanovesicles in basic researches and clinical practices. As mentioned above, MSC-EVs and engineered EVs both have great potential to treat COVID-19. To date, multiple types of EVs have been recruited in clinical trials and numerous hypotheses of EV-based therapies have been proposed. However, there are also concerns when the use of EVs is translated from the bench to the bedside. The first one is unforeseen side-effects that may be triggered by EVs due to our incomplete understanding on the mechanisms by which EVs exert their beneficial effects. For instance, adipose-derived MSC-EVs exhibit thrombogenic activity, which may result in catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome in severe COVID-19 cases [102] . EVs from various types of immortalized cells including T293 cells may possess tumorigenic potential similar to cancer cells, which probably contribute to tumour microenvironment formation and cancer recurrence/metastasis [103] . Second, MSC-EVs are reported to moderate acute immune responses towards regulatory responses that induce tolerance and restore homeostasis [104] . This tolerance induction may have severe adverse effects in the presence of replicating pathogens. Third, there is a lack of unified manufacturing and quality control for the clinical application of EVs. MSC-EV preparations with comparable particle and protein contents can exhibit significant differences in therapeutic efficacy as not all preparations effectively protect neurons in a stroke model [105] . Fourth, although EVs are considered with low immunogenicity, we cannot exclude potential immunogenic and toxic risks of EVs in clinical practice. More seriously, we are currently in lack of the approaches to get rid of the harmful or unwanted cargos in EVs precisely due to technical limitations [106] . Thus, the translation of EVs usage from researches to clinical applications requires multiple steps including the collection of concrete pre-clinical safety and efficacy data, the establishment of appropriate manufacturing and quality control provisions, the development of standardized clinical protocols and the minimization of risks and hazards. Overall, although there are concerns for the usage of EVs, the aforementioned promising results give us confidence to consider EVs as potential therapeutics or delivery system. We believe that with the generation of appropriate manufacturing and quality control provisions, pre-clinical safety and efficacy data, rational clinical trial design and proper regulatory oversight, the application of EVs in treating COVID-19 and many other diseases is a near possibility.@story_separate@The involvement of EVs in lung diseases has been of great interest in the past several years. Being a key component of lung microenvironment, EVs derived from SARS-CoV-2infected cells may promote viral infection, replication, and spreading via delivering viral RNAs and proteins to healthy cells. These EVs also facilitate viral entry and escaping from immune cell recognition by equipping with SARS-CoV-2 receptors like CD9 and ACE2. Furthermore, EVs can modulate immune responses of alveolar macrophages and recruit more immune cells into the lung, leading to exuberant inflammation and cytokine storm. Except for the pathological roles of EVs, the pre-clinical and clinical applications of EV-based therapeutic strategies for treating COVID-19 have been proposed. Through transferring anti-inflammatory RNAs, MSC-EVs decrease the infiltration of immune cells and block the accumulation of cytokines post-i.t., protecting lung tissue from cytokine storm-induced acute injury. EVs selectively loaded with anti-inflammatory or antiviral agents may also demonstrate great therapeutic potential in treating COVID-19. In addition, EVs decorated with viral receptors or proteins may block viral entry through binding with SARS-CoV-2 competitively or stimulating neutralizing antibody production, respectively. In summary, numerous studies have demonstrated the tight association between EVs and the pathogenesis of coronavirus-mediated pneumonia including COVID-19. More comprehensive and meticulous research, aiming to fully unveil the pathological and therapeutic effects of EVs, will shed light on the development of EV-based therapy.","The sudden outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected disease (COVID‐19), initiated from Wuhan, China, has rapidly grown into a global pandemic. Emerging evidence has implicated extracellular vesicles (EVs), a key intercellular communicator, in the pathogenesis and treatment of COVID‐19. In the pathogenesis of COVID‐19, cells that express ACE2 and CD9 can transfer these viral receptors to other cells via EVs, making recipient cells more susceptible for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Once infected, cells release EVs packaged with viral particles that further facilitate viral spreading and immune evasion, aggravating COVID‐19 and its complications. In contrast, EVs derived from stem cells, especially mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, alleviate severe inflammation (cytokine storm) and repair damaged lung cells in COVID‐19 by delivery of anti‐inflammatory molecules. These therapeutic beneficial EVs can also be engineered into drug delivery platforms or vaccines to fight against COVID‐19. Therefore, EVs from diverse sources exhibit distinct effects in regulating viral infection, immune response, and tissue damage/repair, functioning as a double‐edged sword in COVID‐19. Here, we summarize the recent progress in understanding the pathological roles of EVs in COVID‐19. A comprehensive discussion of the therapeutic effects/potentials of EVs is also provided."
"Since the appearance of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan, the World Health Organization has issued an alert on the ""transmissibility, consequences and manifestation of COVID-19 infection"" [1] . Since then, due to its rapid spread throughout the world in the first months of 2020, this virus has been the subject of multiple studies, including geographical distribution of infections [2] , the most vulnerable areas and the variables [3] that promote greater contagion. Governments of subregions (states) and nations need to know the contagion dynamics in order to make decisions [4] . They must also know how the occurrence of cases in the territory will be, in order to manage their resources and attend to the emergency according to the geographical conditions that define the territory [5] . Any infectious disease has a distribution component of the susceptible, infected and exposed population related to its density [6] . However, not only the population density is capable of increasing the possibility of contagion. Factors such as the concentration of services and work centers, and the contact caused by public and private transport, have been considered places where contagion mainly occurs. Although there have been several approaches that attempt to reconcile the possible number of infected with the occurrence of their spatial patterns, as shown in the following table, it is necessary to mention that there are few published approaches for developing countries; this is generally due to the limited availability of data for sub-national levels within the developed countries studies. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, several studies studied the spread of other diseases: among the most studied cases was the AH1N1 influenza. In this case, we take as background two of the main approaches included in these previous studies: (a) studies where simulations or geostatistical tools were performed to estimate the geographical spread of infectious diseases; (b) assessments of how some socioeconomic factors are related to the presence of infections in a given space. Table 1 describes main studies in both. Table 1 . Spatial approximations for the COVID-19 and other diseases spread.@story_separate@Mao and Bian, 2010 a [7] Buffalo Metropolitan Area and Niagara Falls An individual spatially explicit model is established to replicate a network of urban contacts and simulate influenza epidemics. The resulting epidemic curves and infection intensity maps are used to analyze transmission dynamics. Liang Mao, 2014 a [8] Applicable to any city with 1 million inhabitants. It proposes a spatially explicit agent-based model to simulate a triple diffusion process in a metropolitan area of 1 million people. S. Zhao, 2020 b [9] Mainland China The association between Wuhan's domestic passenger load and the number of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases in different cities in China is examined and explored. Several predictive models have been applied to forecast and describe the tends and outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. These methods explored the estimation of infected, recovered, or deaths, mainly during this pandemic. The most common methods are explored by using the SIR method and its variants: SEIR or SIR model [15, 16] ; other methods have reported improved results by using the Gumpertz model or logistic models [17] . The aim of this work is to investigate the mechanics of spread of COVID-19 in a subregional area (Hidalgo State), located in Mexico, focusing on geographical spreading and the relationship between socioeconomic indicators and spreading, by using GIS and statistical tools. To do so, firstly, the pandemic trend in Hidalgo state was described, defining the most fitting model (1) and then carrying out a geographical approach (2), based on the probability of infection (3) as well as density. Finally, a regression model, with Box-Cox transformation was used (4) in order to identify the main variables which could have any impact on COVID-19 geographical spread. We found that we were able to use the Gumpertz model, and by using official data, we found a peak on day 136; then, we defined, by using the Montecarlo model, the highest possible probability of each age group and place of contact: we found that the highest values of probability of infection are for adults who attend workplaces. Finally, the assessment of the relationship between the spread of cases and the socio-economic factors showed that population density and the workplaces in each locality are factors that impact COVID-19 spreading. Developing countries are often more vulnerable to health risks, and the spread of the pandemic can occur in spatial trends related to weak controls that are different to those from developed countries. Additionally, lack of data is a common problem; in this study we explore the spread of COVID-19 as a spatial variable related to the density of demographic factors, defining which are the main factors in a subregional area: The State of Hidalgo, México. The state of Hidalgo is located in central Mexico, in the northern part of the periphery of Mexico City ( Figure 1 ). The municipalities in the southern part of the state belong to the Megalopolis of Mexico City and, therefore, have a strong dynamic of goods, services, and people mobility towards the center of the city and the rest of peripheral cities such as Puebla, Querétaro, Cuernavaca, Toluca, and Tlaxcala [18] Healthcare 2020, 8  To define how COVID-19 would be transmitted, it is necessary to establish a contact network. Due to this high dynamic of interactions, the level of contact is very high, and thence infectious diseases such as the new type of Coronavirus have a high spread from Mexico City to peripheral cities, as other studies that discuss the geographical scope of the epidemics have shown [9] . Since the first cases appeared in Mexico City on 28 February 2020, an attempt was made to establish models that explain the monitoring of the pandemic. However, most of the approaches have been carried out at a federal level, and the geographic definition has been limited to the realization of thematic maps, in some cases including municipalities, which constitute an effort to inform the population but do not provide a greater level of analysis for decision-making, which have been reported in [19] . To define how COVID-19 would be transmitted, it is necessary to establish a contact network. This network is used to represent how individuals interact and have contact with other people in different places. According to Bian [20] , and referred to by Mao and Bian [7] , there are four types of places (homes, workplaces, service locations with transportation). To define data for the analysis network, another Latin American case of study was used. Grijalva, C. et al. [21] performed a contact network where the nature of the contacts by age is defined. Data collection from Table 2 is necessary to define the spaces where these contacts can occur, and the level of contact for each age group and produce the geographical approach of probability, and also to assess how COVID-19 could spread in the State of Hidalgo and how some socioeconomic and demographic factors are related to this spread. To do this, data were collected from the sources in Table 2 . To investigate the mechanics of geographical spread of COVID-19 and the relationship between socio-economic indicators and spread, we first described the pandemic trends in the state of Hidalgo, defining the most suitable model (1) and then carrying out a geographic approach (2), based on the probability of infection (3) . Finally, a regression model, with Box-Cox transformation, was used (4) in order to identify the main variables which could have any impact on COVID-19 geographical spread. Two models were used to describe the trend of the pandemic in the state of Hidalgo. (a) SEIR and SEIRS+ model. First, a SEIR model in its standard form requires the parameters of infectious, incubation, and recovery rates. In our first approach with the SEIR model, we considered the parameters 0.626, 0.19, and 0.344, respectively. After that, we used the SEIRS+ Network Model package that includes an implementation of the Extended SEIRS model in stochastic dynamical networks. In this approach, individuals are represented as nodes in a network, and parameters, contacts, and interventions can be defined according to Ryan, S.E, cited by Hoque, M. E. and Das [27] . When using the SEIRS+ module, we assigned same values, so beta = 0.626, sigma = 0.19, and gamma = 0.344 were used to run the epidemiological model on the demographic network; this demographic network is computed using the proposed python function mentioned above. This includes demographic data from Hidalgo state, such as household size, age of members, and household statistics. (b) Gumpertz model. The official data were fitted by using the Gumpertz model. This model has a self-regulated growth function, where growth rate decays exponentially, after reaching an inflection point. Gumpertz function is similar to a logistic function, but its less symmetrical nature makes it more suitable for biological phenomena. This is expressed as: where a is the growth and is a maximum asymptote; b is a constant adjusted with initial data and defines the function displacement on x. c is a constant related to intrinsic growth capability. Subsequently, the first derivation of Equation (1) was obtained, to be interpreted as the curve that defines new daily cases, as in Equation (2). Equation (2) allows estimating future covid-19 cases between the following days of pandemic, considering the maximum point of this function as the pandemic peak in Hidalgo. With the data of new cases in the state of Hidalgo, an adjustment of the behavior of the curve was carried out. The adjustment of the theoretical curve was reviewed, considering that the official data in the initial 150 days were required to define the initial parameters a, b, and c, in order to integrate them into the Python code that was previously made. Most infectious diseases have a direct and positive correlation with population density and other socio-economic factors related to density. Especially COVID-19 has demonstrated this characteristic [8] . For this study, calculations of different densities were made: (a) of total population; (b) of housing (c) and workplaces, (d) which are service locations; (e) of age groups such as children (0 to 14 years), economically active population (15 to 59 years), and older adults (60 years and older). To calculate these densities, we used the Kernel algorithm, which calculates a magnitude per unit area from point or polyline entities using a Kernel function to fit a smoothly tapered surface to each point or polyline. We considered 3 age groups and 4 contact areas mentioned in the previous paragraphs. According to the network of contacts defined by Bian [3] , we geographically referred these spaces through the ArcGis software using the following method: (a) Workplaces: The economic units defined in the DENUE national directory of economic units [23] were assigned to each locality through a proximity analysis that assigned each workplace to the closest locality. (b) Places of service provision: The economic units of service provision (sectors 41 to 95) defined in the DENUE [23] were assigned to each locality through a proximity analysis assigned to each service provision site. (c) Housing in each locality: We projected the growth of housing until 2020 based on the growth rate between 2010 and 2015. (d) Traffic level: Capacity level of the main state highways, during 2018. In order to determine the level of capacity in the localities, the Kriging method was interpolated and a road buffer was established, according to Figure 2 . Representation of population densities and counts based on the kernel algorithm shows that the concentration of households, population, work centers, service supplies centers, and traffic levels denoted the impact of main population centers and metropolitan areas. Some of these factors are represented in Figure 2 . In addition, a database obtained collects information on the number of people in each age range, the average population density of each locality, and the number of economic units in each sector. We estimated the probability of infection in the State of Hidalgo. According to Mao and Bian [7] , the proportion of infections in a pandemic scenario in households is in a range of 47-51%, while at workplaces it is estimated at 37-42%, and for service places, 11-12%; we consider these values as infection rate per place with a uniform probability distribution. On the other hand, Grijalva et al. [21] estimate the proportion of contacts by category for contact duration and age ranges. This contact proportion has been interpreted as the E contact variable with a probability distribution of contacts per age; as age increases so does the duration of contact. The maximum and minimum values of E contact range from 0 to 1. To obtain the infection rate per age I Gedad , the average of the minimum and maximum value of infection rate per place and proportion of contact per age were calculated for each type of place (households, workplaces, and service places). Those maximum and minimum values were estimated by using Oracle Crystal Ball utility. Once obtained, the E contact and I Gedad values and the infection probability per age and place were calculated. For this, Monte-Carlo simulations were carried out considering the maximum and minimum values as well as their probability distributions. The reception of infection through a contact was simulated based on the probability of infection: where E contact is the effectiveness of a contact for infection. In this case, we consider close contacts. I Gedad is the age-specific infection rate and is expressed between 0 and 1. The probability p can be estimated for I Gedad and E contact . Contact intensity was weighted between 0 and 1 in the defined areas: work, services, and households, with data from the contact network developed by Grijalva et al. [21] . In this way, infection probability was defined by each age group and by place of contact. As described by Hamidi, infection probability is highly related to density [14] , so maps describing probability weighted by density were estimated. Additionally, a consideration on mobility restrictions of 30% (average) according to analytics by Google was applied to contact factors in workplaces and transportation. Representation of population densities and counts based on the kernel algorithm shows that the concentration of households, population, work centers, service supplies centers, and traffic levels denoted the impact of main population centers and metropolitan areas. Some of these factors are represented in Figure 2 . In addition, a database obtained collects information on the number of people in each age range, the average population density of each locality, and the number of economic units in each sector.  Initially, each case was plotted as a point per locality. As described above, densities were estimated to population, households, workplaces, and service supply places using the kernel algorithm, as well as traffic level by krigging. Also, variables such as latitude, longitude, and altitude are implicit in raster files. Similar approaches were used by Copiello and Grillenzoni [6] and Hamibi, S. et al. [14] . We used the least squares method defining the function that describes the spread in the territory in order to achieve an accurate estimation of spatially explicit cases. The dependent variables tested such as latitude, longitude, and altitude were extracted from raster files, and the kernel algorithm was used to obtain population density, households, work places, places of service provision, and traffic flow level. Independent variables were tested as the number of cumulative cases. A BoxCox transformation was applied to the original model correcting specification assumption of autocorrelation and normality, which were evaluated with Durbin-Watson and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Significant variables were used to address the geographic distribution of cases. The study used Map algebra to distribute Covid-19 cases along the state of Hidalgo, based on results of BoxCox regression, weighting variables according to their coefficients as well as their significant values. Kernel distributions rasters were introduced as factors to estimate the distribution of COVID cases; this way, the resulting raster is more realistic than the simple kernel distribution cases. With the growth model of the state of Hidalgo data, and the following adjustment data: a = 19,370, as the maximum number of estimated cases for each day; b is the estimated growth rate estimated for total COVID-19 cases, so b = 0.1426, according to the Gumpertz; c = 136.6 is the days on which the number of new cases per day can occur. Using the difference of squares, the adjusted measure result was 0.997. As indicated above, the SEIR approach was useful in the early days of the pandemic, but the function became excessive, and furthermore its geometric nature does not explain the behavior of pandemic. In the SEIR model initially considered, a high number of accumulated cases was predicted (around 7% of the total population, which means more than 200,000 cases); meanwhile, the maximum Gompertz curve was forecast at 17,000 cumulative official cases. That is why we consider the SEIR as difficult to validate with the test rate in México (0.4-11 tests per thousand persons), while we were able to validate the Gumpertz trends with official data. As well as Gumpertz, the results can be validated, at least with official data. To validate the results obtained, data of the next 20 days were analyzed for validation of the Gompertz model, from which an inference was obtained that has a maximum error of 4% of the official data. Figure 3 displays our results (see Appendix A). By applying the Montecarlo model with the purpose of obtaining the most possible probability ranges for each population group and contact place. We found that for the adult population group with the highest infection probability, the ranges were 0.06 to 0.26 for workplaces, 0.07-0.27 for service places, and 0.06-0.27 for households. The seniors group showed a probability of infection of 0.06 to 0.24 in service places, and 0.05 to 0.23 for workplaces and households. Finally, the children group showed probability ranges from 0.05 to 0.24 for workplaces (including schools) and service places and 0.05 to 0.23 in households. To represent these probabilities in maps, Figure 4 was obtained. In each part of the figure, different assumptions about mobility restrictions were considered. The first part does not consider any mobility restriction, while part (b) and (c) do.  With the growth model of the state of Hidalgo data, and the following adjustment data: a = 19,370, as the maximum number of estimated cases for each day; b is the estimated growth rate estimated for total COVID-19 cases, so b = 0.1426, according to the Gumpertz; c = 136.6 is the days on which the number of new cases per day can occur. Using the difference of squares, the adjusted measure result was 0.997. As indicated above, the SEIR approach was useful in the early days of the pandemic, but the function became excessive, and furthermore its geometric nature does not explain the behavior of pandemic. In the SEIR model initially considered, a high number of accumulated cases was predicted (around 7% of the total population, which means more than 200,000 cases); meanwhile, the maximum Gompertz curve was forecast at 17,000 cumulative official cases. That is why we consider the SEIR as difficult to validate with the test rate in México (0.4-11 tests per thousand persons), while we were able to validate the Gumpertz trends with official data.

To validate the results obtained, data of the next 20 days were analyzed for validation of the Gompertz model, from which an inference was obtained that has a maximum error of 4% of the official data. Figure 3 displays our results (see Appendix A).  By applying the Montecarlo model with the purpose of obtaining the most possible probability ranges for each population group and contact place. We found that for the adult population group with the highest infection probability, the ranges were 0.06 to 0.26 for workplaces, 0.07-0.27 for service places, and 0.06-0.27 for households. The seniors group showed a probability of infection of 0.06 to 0.24 in service places, and 0.05 to 0.23 for workplaces and households. Finally, the children group showed probability ranges from 0.05 to 0.24 for workplaces (including schools) and service places and 0.05 to 0.23 in households. To represent these probabilities in maps, Figure 4 was obtained. In each part of the figure, different assumptions about mobility restrictions were considered. The first part does not consider any mobility restriction, while part (b) and (c) do. Regarding Figure 4 , in part (a), the infection probability without any restriction measures, where people attend to work, and use services and public transport according to their geographical location, was determined. In part (b), infection probability was estimated considering a restriction in mobility to services by decreasing 30% in transportation. In part (c) of the figure, infection probability was estimated considering a higher percentage in mobility due to restrictions (more than 35%). As shown in all cases in Figure 4 , metropolitan areas of the southern fringe of Hidalgo have the highest values; this can be explained by the proximity to Mexico City and its interactions. With these last variables, which are based on territorial density, a distribution model was established, based on a regression with BoxCox transformation. This model allows determining the main factors that define COVID-19 cases throughout the territory of the state of Hidalgo, according to the previously modeled Gompertz curve cases and their geographical distribution. COVID-19 cumulative cases were distributed. The expression that describes this approach is given by: where C a means the accumulated cases, 1.11 is the intercept, P is the population density distributed by kernel algorithm, and W is the density of workplaces per square kilometer, also obtained by kernel. The coefficient of determination R 2 result was 0.543, and both dependent variables were significant at 95% (and are marked by the symbol *), as well as the model. Figure 5 shows the geographical distribution of cases, based on Equation (4), at three different times of the pandemic: day 136, peak on day 150 and day 300.  Regarding the performance of the Gompertz model, although several theoretical curves have been generated, the one presented in this exercise adjusts to what has happened according to reports from the Federal Ministry of Health and the state of Hidalgo. In the same way, it is considered a factor of unknown cases, that according to federal data is set to be 8.3. Hence, cases can officially increase up to 17,000 official cases in 300 days, with 140,000 more unofficial cases considered in the same period. The low rate of testing in Mexico is still a limitation to more accurate approaches and validations, as according to OECD and the site in our world in data, from Oxford University, testing rates have increased from April to September 2020: in April, 0.4 tests per 1000 people were registered, while in September, 11.11 tests per 1000 people were registered. Although there are several studies for this purpose, the present work suggests an approach to subregional areas from developing countries with limited data, where, by using not so complex geoprocessing methods, we can obtain valuable information for planning and decision-making during the pandemic. This work describes an estimation of cases based in common models, and describes how age groups' probability of infection differs according the place where contacts occur; these infection probabilities were spatially distributed by using raster data of population densities, and finally, the raster files produced were used to define by a regression the most significant variables that affect the spread of COVID. Those methods are commonly used in similar studies, but have not been integrated to configure a useful work for pandemic management in subregional areas. Regarding the obtained results, considering the expansion factor of 8.3 obtained by the epidemiologic analysts of the National Health Council, unofficial cases can be more than 140 thousand cases until day 300 of the pandemic. Previous estimates were performed by using SIR-based studies (2) , and also Gumpertz, Logistic function, and neural network approaches, by Torrealba-Rodríguez et al. [17] , where Gompertz was found to be an accurate model to estimate COVID-19 cases across the country, and it was the closest data to the validation date, while the logistic model was no so accurate. Additionally, in this work, we only report a difference in squares, and not R 2 , because it is an inadequate measure for nonlinear models [29] . However, SIR-based approaches have also predicted the pandemic. The probability of infection showed higher values in the adult group in workplaces, which corroborates the results reported in the data by the Federal Ministry of Health [25] and according to maps, the southern fringe is the most affected area in the State of Hidalgo, due to its interaction with Mexico City. In this work, variables such as population density and presence of workplaces were also found to greatly impact the spread of COVID-19, as described by Mameulnd, S.E. et al. [13] , Copiello and Grillenzoni [6] , and Hamidi et al. [14] . The public policies about pandemic management are still incomplete; although isolation measures have been applied in many countries and their regions, more approaches are needed to improve public health policies in the context of this pandemic.@story_separate@Regarding the lack of data for developing countries, logistic efforts can be avoided by using geostatistical data and models, which are tools for decision makers when resources are not sufficient to deal with this pandemic or other disease outbreaks. According to the models, although a first peak has been reached, cumulative cases are still occurring even 400 days after the pandemic. The probability of infection showed ranges from 0.04-0.23 to 0.06-0.26 with a 90% confidence level; the adult group in workplaces has the highest values. Population densities, household, workplaces, services supply, and traffic levels are important, but according to the BoxCox regression performed, population density, work places density, and traffic levels are the most important variables, although the last one was on the limit of significance. Those factors can explain COVID-19 case distribution with R 2 = 0.543. This accentuates the impact of workplaces on the pandemic spread in the State of Hidalgo. These data can guide pandemic management policies in this place. The isolation policies can be more effective when people are not attending work and can decrease the pressure on supply service centers. It is also necessary to decrease traffic levels as much as possible; this is a challenge because economic activation is necessary. More specific metrics in the state of Hidalgo would be helpful for this kind of research-for example, travel surveys. The research was based on several tools such as spatial analysis, map algebra, and modeling, adjusted to several models; these approaches are critical to tackle the pandemic challenge in subregional areas of developing countries.","The novel COVID-19, detected in Wuhan, China, has reached almost every city across the globe, and researchers from many countries have used several epidemiologic models to describe the epidemic trends. In this context, it is also important to know the geographic extent of the infected population. Following this approach, a Gumpertz model was adapted with official data from the state of Hidalgo, Mexico, in order to estimate the people infected during this COVID-19 pandemic. We found, based on the adjusted data, the highest value in infected people according to official and theoretical data. Furthermore, using a geographical analysis based on geostatistical measures related to density of demographic and economic data, traffic level and geolocation, raster files were generated to estimate probability of coronavirus cases occurrence using the areas where the contagion may occur. We also distributed the maximum contagion obtained by the epidemic model, using these raster files, and a regression model to weight factors according their importance. Based on this estimated distribution, we found that most of the infected people were located in the southern border, a trend related to the economic strip in the southern part of Hidalgo State, associated with its vicinity to the Megacity of Mexico."
"Given the diversity of populations that intersect at hotels and other rented establishments in closed spaces, hotels are potential hotspots for disease spreading. A number of studies that have been conducted thus far have focused mainly on the spreading of food diseases through food contamination (Beauté et al. 2019 ; Hull-Jackson and Adesiyun 2019), environmental contamination (Kimura et al. 2011) and swimming pool contamination, with a few focusing on the spread of airborne diseases (Marks et al. 2000) . Accordingly, hotels and other accommodation establishments within the hospitality industry are sensitive health risk areas. Disease exposure that emanates from hotels can result in criminal liability, and hotels have been found liable in various cases. Where liability has been proven, the implications on reputational damage could be dire; as such, the industry adopts stringent protocols, particularly when it comes to food safety (Gursoy 2019) . Because diseases may emanate from hotels, the hotel sector is vulnerable to disease outbreaks, and, given the perishability of the tourism product, such threats may have severe implications. Disease outbreaks affect hotel room occupancy (Yang et al. 2020) with often devastating implications for the revenue and profits of hotels. Moreover, disturbances to mobility, which forms the basis of the tourism industry, can be detrimental to the hotel industry. An inter-agency report produced by the United Nations paints a dire picture of the global economy, citing slow growth that extends from 2019 and which has been compounded by the outbreak of COVID-19, mainly in 2020 (United Nations 2020a). The report notes that the past couple of years have seen an increase in poverty levels across sub-Saharan Africa, a trend which will be perpetuated and worsened by . The declaration of the coronavirus disease as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 sent shockwaves through the global market, triggering a wave of economic shockwaves that by far surpass those from the economic recession of 2008 (International Monetary Fund (IMF) 2020). The IMF later declared that with the impact of COVID-19, the world had entered a recession with marginal growth being expected for 2020. As a consequence, the world saw a massive capital outflow from emerging economies as the economic impact of the pandemic took hold. The United Nations (UN 2020b) notes that the pandemic was not only a health problem but also a socio-economic crisis which calls for global cooperation. The UN notes that, as a consequence, serious setbacks were expected to the achievement of all the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One of the sectors most affected by the demand for social distancing and avoidance of public gatherings was the tourism industry (UN 2020a). Previously Dube et al. (2020) touted tourism as the critical tool preferred to achieve several SDGs by many communities and countries across the world. Tourism creates and sustains jobs and creates entrepreneurship opportunities for millions of people around the world. The coronavirus affected both the supply and demand side of the economy, which crippled many industries, including the tourism industry. With several airlines and cruise ships grounded, the supply chain for the tourism industry, especially hotels and short-term accommodation rentals such as Airbnb, was severely disrupted. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projected that as a result of the pandemic, about 65.5 million jobs in the tourism sector would be lost in 2020 (IATA 2020) . The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), on the other hand, postulated that the tourism industry was expecting to see a drastic slump in tourist arrivals of between 20 and 30% in 2020 (UNWTO 2020). This was projected to cost the industry $300 billion to $450 billion in international tourism receipts. This constitutes a third of the $1.5 trillion expected global losses under the worst-case scenario (UNWTO 2020). Given that reality and the understanding that tourism was severely affected by the pandemic, there is a need to quantify the levels of the impact of coronavirus on various tourism sectors and subsectors at international, regional, national and local levels. This study investigated how the hotel and Airbnb arm of the tourism and hospitality industry was affected by COVID-19 pre and post its declaration as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).@story_separate@There is a feeling that the world did not pay as much attention as it should have when the WHO flagged the coronavirus as a global threat in January 2020 (WHO 2020a) . This could be attributed to several factors chief among them was a feeling that it would just end as an Asian Pacific problem. As such, attempts to institute quick intervention measures were ridiculed in a move that could have saved or slowed down the scourge. Little was known about the disease except by the Chinese, who had witnessed a first-hand account of the ravaging impact of the pandemic (Hjelmgaard 2020) . The Chinese have been accused of hiding crucial information that could have reduced the impact of the disease; this has led to global political tension, particularly between the USA and China. The last two decades have seen an increase in endemic and pandemic disease outbreaks (Chung 2015) , and these have had a significant impact on regional tourism economies. Some of these outbreaks have had a significant impact on global and regional tourism in the last two decades and include the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( In 2009, Rittichainuwat and Chakraborty noted that there was a marked increase in the occurrence of diseases and other threats to tourism. The authors found that in as much as tourists understand the risk of diseases and other threats, they evaluated the risk before travelling to destinations and consequently take preventative or precautionary measures. Tourists are generally a risk-averse group of people who are sensitive to potential risks (Irvine and Anderson 2006; Tavitiyaman and Qu 2013) . To this end, there is a need to consider tourism risk as a central element of tourism that takes into consideration, among other things, disease outbreaks (Perpiña, Camprubase outbreak 2019). Quintal et al. (2010) reiterated the importance of attention to risk in the tourism industry, as it invokes feelings of anxiety, fear and insecurity among tourists. Such feelings could affect tourist appreciation of a destination and negatively affect their experience, hence the temptation to avoid or postpone visits in the light of a disaster, thus affecting hotel and Airbnb bookings. There are differences in attitude towards risk by different tourist typologies, which could affect arrivals during and after disease outbreaks. Wu et al. (2010) proposed a model for projecting the effect of disease outbreaks on hotel occupancy, with a view to buffering them from shocks. When tourists cancel visits, hotels suffer and revenue loss results. The fact that tourism is a highly perishable good makes it difficult at times to detect risk easily (Williams and Baláž 2013) . Jayawardena et al. (2008) noted that SARS pandemic had negative implications for the tourism and hospitality industry, with a global cost of $15 billion, and led to job losses in the hospitality and tourism industry. In Toronto, for example, job losses in tourism and hospitality contribute 75% of the jobs that were lost during the SARS outbreak. The SARS pandemic also resulted in significant conference cancellations and negatively affected tourism revenues, which may have been the main trigger for job losses at the iconic Niagara Falls (Jayawardena et al. 2008) . The impact of the disease was felt far and wide, even though the pandemic had originated in China's Guangdong Province before emerging in neighbouring Hong Kong (Pine and McKercher 2004) . Hong Kong suffered immensely as a result of the SARS outbreak both in human and financial costs. According to Pine and McKercher (2004) , the losses were mainly due to tourism capital investment postponement, dented destination image and travel cancellations and postponements, which had implications for hoteliers. As a consequence of the outbreak, tourist arrivals at Hong Kong International Airport slumped nearly 80%, declining to 565,000 from a peak of more than 2.8 million in May 2002. Massive job losses were experienced in the hotel, catering, transport, amusement and other recreational areas and hotel occupancy dropped 10-12% (Pine and McKercher 2004) . Chen et al. (2007) found that the SARS pandemic led to hotel stock volatility in the Taiwanese tourism market, which led to losses in revenue by shareholders. Rittichainuwat and Chakraborty (2009) argued that even though the WHO did not issue a warning to the world about bird flu (H5N1 virus), a number of people died and the outbreak had a damaging effect on the reputation of hotel and tourism industry in Thailand. Page et al. (2012) found that the outbreak of swine flu that coincided with the economic recession harmed the hotel and industry in the UK, as the tourism sector in that country reported drastic declines in bookings and arrivals from all its major tourism markets. Another country that was affected by swine flu was Brunei. According to Haque and Haque (2018) , Brunei recorded a loss of nearly 30,000 (15%) tourists and B$15 million in 1 year as a result of swine flu. The swine flu outbreak resulted in apprehensions about travelling for a number of tourists, which had an impact on several tourism destinations and markets, much to the detriment of the hotel industry (Lee et al. 2012) . Hung et al. (2018) note that coronaviruses such as SARS and H1N1 swine flu place an increased burden of expenses on hotels as they raise the need for facilities to be sanitised. Other pandemics that have had a significant impact on the hotel industry include the Ebola virus. The outbreaks of the Ebola virus in North Africa affected hotel bookings across the continent (Novelli et al. 2018) . Given their exposure to crises such as pandemics, hotels have developed specific response measures as an adaptation mechanism for addressing continued external threats of disease. Israeli and Reichel (2003) highlighted 19 strategies that are often adopted by the industry to mitigate the impact of pandemics on hotel financial performance. These include cost-cutting and cost-containment measures which include offering massive discounts, making increased marketing efforts, cutting outsourced services, postponing capital expenditure and reducing the labour force. Such measures could have worked in regional disease outbreaks, but none of the measures has been tested for their effectiveness in the context where there is a global pandemic such as COVID-19. Regardless of the resilience that has been shown by the hotel and tourism industry to deal with the crisis, hotels have often found themselves either ill-prepared or unknowledgeable to deal with disease pandemics (Chien and Law 2003) , as each disease outbreak has shown unique attributes which present challenges for each pandemic. Yu and Aviso (2020) and also Dube et al. (2020) argued that on a global scale, COVID-19 has resulted in company closures, with a devastating impact on tourism sectors such as hotels and rented accommodation such as Airbnb. Preliminary studies have shown that China reported a hotel occupancy decline of 71% year-on-year in February 2020 (Yang et al. 2020 ). The authors further argued that travel restrictions were hurting economies. To this end, the United Nations (2020b) advocated for an undertaking of impact assessments that will translate into a better understanding of the pandemic's impact to assist in the response. This study examined and measured the impact of COVID-19 on hotels and Airbnbs. A multisource-critical document analysis (Karppinen and Moe 2019) was used to make meaning from a wide range of reports, notices and advisories by major hotel groups that have a footprint across the world. Authoritative sources such as national news media were interrogated to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the hospitality industry. Borrowing from text data mining, the researchers used hotel group names and paired them with COVID-19 and coronavirus and searched Google to see all communications and news that were associated with the hotel with regard to the pandemic. A further perusal of company websites was made to ensure that the process was as exhaustive as possible. From there an automated Google Search algorithm populated all the stories and media coverage of the impact of COVID-19 on hotels and Airbnb. This ensured that sufficient attention was paid to all the reports that were emerging on the subject matter. Data from HotelRunner Pulse was used to evaluate the impact of the disease being declared a pandemic on hotel bookings. Hotel Pulse integrates information and data from five major booking platforms, namely, Agoda, Expedia, Airbnb, Hotelbeds and Booking.com. HotelRunner dashboard data that were used were generated to provide HotelRunner Pulse's partners with a picture of industry performance. The dashboard uses the content based on anonymous booking data of more than 38,000 properties from 193 countries running on the HotelRunner platform (HotelRunner Pulse 2020). The data can be said to be representative of the global hotel industry. Data from the American Hotel and Lodging Association were also used to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on hotels and employment in the USA. Data on proportionate impacts of the US hotel industry based on historical performance during past shocks were measured on a 10% impact quartile. Data used for the Airbnb section came from AirDNA, which uses machine learning algorithms to track ten million listings in 80,000 markets globally on Airbnb, Vrbo and other booking sites. With millions of rooms to track globally, the use of machine learning to detect trends is encouraged (Al-Jarrah et al. 2015; Qiu et al. 2016) . Qualitative data were analysed using the generic thematic and content analysis as espoused by Nowell et al. (2017) , whereas quantitative data were analysed using Microsoft Excel ToolPak. The following sections present and discuss the main findings of the study. The first section presents the main findings, starting with showing general trends in booking and followed by a section that highlights results from selected global hotel groups. This is followed by a presentation on the impact of COVID-19 on the American hotel industry. The following section deals with the impact of the pandemic on rented accommodation and then makes a number of conclusions and recommendations. The study found that there were three critical interventions that had significant negative effects on hotels and short-term rental accommodation establishments. These included closures of ports, national lockdowns and the active promotion of social distancing. With flight cancellations, there was no supply of tourists to accommodation establishments in many parts of the world, triggering a wave of hotel cancellations. Figure 8 .1 shows three episodes pertaining to 3 weeks between March and April 2020 in relation to the confirmed gross book value. According to Expedia (2020:1): Gross value is the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions, recorded at the time of booking. Bookings include the total price due for travel, including taxes, fees and other charges, and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds. It emerged that there was a significant decline in gross booking value due to cancellations between mid-March and early April 2020. Significant declines were observed, over 50% for the year 2020, save for the months of October and December 2020. Needless to say, the intermediate months post the announcement of COVID-19 as a pandemic has resulted in a considerable loss in revenue. There are declines reaching over 95% in April, May and June 2020. A significant decline in gross booking value is also seen in July 2020 although the decline starts to ease off a bit. This means that most travellers felt that the pandemic was going to have a severe impact on travel patterns in short to medium term. The pandemic will have a longterm effect, however, as it has negatively affected bookings for the whole of 2020 with prospects for affecting the early 2021 bookings. The confirmed gross booking value for the period 30 March to 5 April 2020 looked promising, however, as it showed reduced percentages of decline and recorded a positive balance in December 2020. The glimmer of hope could be a testimony to the resilience of the tourism industry, as noted by Filimonau and De Coteau (2020) . The positive outlook for December 2020 is encouraging as it could be a sign of market rebound as people look forward to the festive season. There was also a consideration of forward bookings, taking two snapshots at two points in the third week of March 2020 and during the first week of April 2020 ( Fig. 8.2a, b) . From Fig. 8 Fig. 8.2 (a and b) Forward-looking confirmed booking volume: monthly distribution of the confirmed booking volume in the same booking window. (Source: Authors, data from HotelRunner (2020)) periods, however, April to June 2019 outperforms the same period in 2020, a situation that can be attributed to lower bookings as a result of cancellations caused by a coronavirus. On a comparative basis, there is evidence that 2020 was set to outperform 2019 given stronger bookings in some months, including March, had it not been the impact of the pandemic that disrupted the trend. This can be attributed to the anticipated increase in growth pattern in the tourism industry, as seen on a year-to-year basis. However, the situation might change abruptly due to the announced recession caused by the COVID-19. It is crucial to note that in the absence of the pandemic, there is evidence that tourism would have done better in 2020 than last year (2019). The booking cancellations between the 3 weeks focus of the study were also analysed. Wholesale cancellations of bookings were observed in the short term, with most of the bookings being cancelled in the third week of March 2020 and in April 2020. The upsurge in infections led to the tightening of border controls and the prohibition of public events and social gatherings. Record cancellations could have been triggered by the realisation that travel was not going to be feasible amid the raging pandemic. The long-term booking rate (July 2020 onwards) was not as affected, possibly because the tourists expected the disease to have died away in a few months. It could also be that people will be getting back into their routines, or it could be tourists adopting a wait-and-see attitude. However, in the third week of March 2020, there were record cancellations (Fig. 8.3) . As discussed earlier, diseases instil fear and create anxiety among tourists (Tavitiyaman and Qu 2013) . In this regard, the cancellations may be attributed to the fear people have about being infected or affected by the disease, hence cancelling or postponing holiday journeys. (2020)) On a comparable basis with 2019 in both snapshots taken for the weeks 16 to 23 March 2020 and 30 March 2020 to 5 April 2020 (Fig. 8.4a, b) , a large number of booking cancellations are shown during March, April and May 2020, particularly during the third week of March 2020 (Fig. 8.4a ). However, booking cancellations during the second episode under investigation for March and April were even higher (Fig. 8.4b Higher cancellations and lower bookings meant that hotels and lodges across the world were losing much-needed cash flow, given the uncertainties that were associated with the disease. The cancellations and weak confirmed bookings had a significant impact on the liquidity and cash flow of lodges and hotels in the short and long term. Such a scenario in the short term incapacitated the hotel industry which found itself in a forced liquidity crisis. Most hotels realised that they were bleeding cash, hence the need for cost-containment and cost-cutting measures to kick in, which meant freezing positions, job layoffs and furloughs in some instances. The next section outlines how selected group hotels and hotel organisations were affected and reacted to the problem. Table 8 .1 summarises the effects of COVID-19 on the operations of selected hotel groups. Further investigation of the response strategies implemented by each hotel group was also done. It emerged that most hotels had their operations suspended and occupancy rates dwindled to single digits. This led to massive job furloughs across the sector, cancellation of dividend payouts and deferment of capital expenditure, among other things. Such cost-cutting and cost-containment measures have severe implications for the hotel industry and its stakeholders and the tourism industry as a whole, as accommodation performance is often used as a proxy for tourism industry performance. One of the worst affected, and the largest, hotel market was the USA (United States of America). According to UNWTO (2020), the USA received 80 million visitors, with receipts worth $214 billion, in 2019. This made it the third most visited country and the top tourism revenue earner globally. The USA is one of the countries that was worst affected by COVID-19, recording 18,516 infections 1,003,974 and 57,730 deaths between 21 January and 30 April 2020 (WHO 2020a). A report by the American Hotel and Lodging Association (2020) shows that COVID-19 ravaged the hotel market with its impact far exceeding the September 11 bombing and the SARS pandemic on the USA hospitality market. As a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic, the average occupancy rate for hotels in the USA dropped to an average of less than 25%. This resulted in between 2.8 and 3.5 million modelled job losses by the end of March 2020, with the expectation that up to 6.5 million jobs could be lost if hotel occupancy continues to slide (American Hotel and Lodging Association 2020). The distribution of job losses is displayed in Fig. 8 .5. Two historical occupancy rate is 59% recorded after the September 11 bombing which resulted in the loss of 400,000 jobs and a 54% occupancy rate during the 2007-2009 economic recession that resulted in 470,000 job losses in the hospitality and tourism sector in the USA (American Hotel and Lodging Association 2020). Significant job losses are expected in California, Florida, Texas and New York (Fig. 8.6 ). The results seem to tally with figures that emanate from the Statista, Impacts and responses to COVID-19 Accor (operates in 100 countries, with more than 4800 hotels and 280,000 employees worldwide) Closed two-thirds (3200) of its hotels worldwide Cancelled 280 million euros ($304 million) in dividends Dedicated to allocating 25% of the planned dividend payout of €70 million to a fund dedicated to employees and ""preserve"" the remainder Introduced a new booking and modification policy that allowed tourists to flexibly manage their bookings or get credit notes and refunds 20-day plus booking discount of 25% which shows California, New York and Texas, among others, as leading in initial job loss claims in the past 3 weeks for each state (21 March-4 April 2020) (Roper 2020) . Evidence from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2020) suggests that over 60% of job losses in March 2020 were in the tourism and hospitality sector. It is important to note that the states with highest job losses were the most affected by COVID-19, of which New York has been one of the worst affected. For example, New York had 181,825 infection cases and 8650 deaths as of 11 April 2020 (University of Virginia 2020). As such, losses in employment have further increased the vulnerability of the respective communities with dire psychosocial and economic effects. Reported 6% decline in business in January and February 2020 and 90% in China At the peak in China, 178 hotels were closed Further 60% decline in business in March 2020 Deferred renovations and imposed salary cuts for staff including board and executive level in March 2020 Cancelled S$150 million in dividends Cut capital expenditure by S$100 million for 2020 Cancelled fee waivers to existing and new bookings at all hotels globally for stays between 9 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 and later extended to 30 June 2020 Modified and/or reduced services in some hotels, e.g. reduction in restaurant and bar service, alternative guest room furnishings and/or amenities Suspended operations (InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) 2020; Brandler 2020) Indonesian Hotel and Restaurant Association (PHRI) Shut down 698 hotels as of the beginning of April 2020 Open hotels were operating below 5% occupancy levels Several hotels in the country were providing delivery service of dishes from their restaurants Tsogo Sun Closed 36 hotels (i.e. 40% of group operations) Postponed capital expenditure and only kept up critical maintenance work Head office support functions operated on a limited staff-only basis to ensure good communication with guests, partners and suppliers The company noted that it was likely to fail to meet its debt obligations if poor occupancies continued beyond 3 to 6 months post-September 2020 Approached lenders to request waivers of covenants to ensure that the facilities to which the Group had access were maintained (Tsogo Sun Hotel Limited; Hospitality Fund Limited 2020) 8.4 Presentation of Data and Discussion of Findings Figure 8 .6 shows that since the beginning of the pandemic, American hotels have been bleeding cash and jobs. This has threatened to bring the hotel industry to a grounding halt if no intervention measures are taken to rescue the situation. The employees and small businesses are also vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic, with a sizeable number of companies at risk of collapse. If the pandemic persists, rescuing the tourism industry is going to be more costly, and it will take longer to ensure that the industry regains stability and starts generating new jobs. It emerges from Fig. 8.6 and Table 8 .1 that the hotel industry lost billions in potential revenue and resulted in job losses as never seen before. While it emerges that the industry chose in the main job furloughs as a cost-cutting measure, such a measure exacerbated the problems for hotel employees. While the employees had to deal with the fear and anxiety caused by the pandemic, they had to face a bleak and uncertain future. Baranik et al. (2019:381) note that furloughs are ""characterised by decreased life satisfaction and increased work-family conflict and physical, cognitive, and emotional burnout even weeks after the shutdown ended"". There is, therefore, a need for the hotel industry to come with some sort of safety net for its employees to shield them from such ever-imminent shocks to the hotel and tourism industry. The other concern is for small to medium enterprises which are vulnerable to the shock of the pandemic. Small to medium enterprises are often without the financial muscle to deal with shocks of such magnitude. Most such enterprises are outcompeted in the race for resources resulting in closures and permanent job losses. The tourism industry has a significant number of small to medium enterprises, and there is a need for these businesses to be protected from failure to protect jobs and the industry. It is appalling to note that despite the US government handout in place, take-up of the rescue package which was supposed to rescue the tourism sector was not embraced with open arms given the conditions that were attached it. The CARES Act imposed a condition that the beneficiaries of the government funding were supposed to use 75% of the fund on the wage bill, something that was strongly protested by the industry through their representative organisation American Hotels and Lodging Association (AHLA) in a letter that was written to Congress, requesting changes to the CARES Act. The AHLA argued that the bill costs were quite minimal as compared to other fixed costs such as property tax, insurance, utility costs, bank loan payments, utilities and franchise fees to the chain brands. The hoteliers noted that in some instances, the Act also restricted hotels from laying off employees, something that was not acceptable to the industry as they pointed out that rehiring about 10% of employees would not make sense, as there was simply no work for employees and if the business could not service other fixed expenses, they were still going to shut down (The Washington Post 2020). The workers association fought back, noting that it was unfair for the industry to ask the government to divert public funds to pay to rich capitalists on Wall Street when workers were laid off. There is a feeling that in as 80% of hotel rooms empty as of April 2020 $10 billion lost in room revenue since February 2020 Lost more than $500 million in room revenue per day Lost $5.5 billion weekly Projected revenue losses of more than 50% for the first half of 2020 Nearly 3.9 million total jobs either elimitnated or to be eliminated in the short term 70% of direct hotel employees laid off or put on furlough Hotel employees lost more than $2.4 billion of earnings weekly 33,000 small businesses were at immediate risk of collapse much as it was raising some valid arguments, the main thrust was to protect the investor and the business and not necessarily the employee. The coronavirus did not only affect the tourism industry; the impact was felt among all its stakeholders throughout the sector's value chain. The deferment and postponement of the payment of dividends adversely affected shareholders. Beyond the shareholders, suppliers and support services, the hoteliers were adversely affected by the pandemic through business losses. The shareholders are likely to fork out more money to remain afloat with the most affected being small and medium enterprises that are likely to go bankrupt in the not too distant future. A number of hotel groups indicated that they had deferred capital projects. This meant a decline in tourism investments. A decline in investment would adversely affect support workers and the construction industry the most which may further worsen the recession and will likely have a knock-on effect on employment in that sector. In some instances, the hospitality industry has contacts with farmers and other fresh produce producers for the provision of food. This sector has also suffered due to the closure of hotels and the decline in demand, with implications for the global food market industry and probably its employees, which might see dwindling returns for farmers. Besides the food suppliers, the other daily consumables that are used in the hotel industry have also been adversely affected by the declining demand. The hotel industry has some fixed obligations, which can be pretty substantial (Rushmore and O'Neill 2015) . Such obligations need to be serviced regardless of whether the hotel is trading or not. Given the robust growth in the tourism industry which grew at a rate of 3.5% against a global economic growth rate of 2.5% (UNWTO 2020), many hoteliers were involved in the expansion and/or acquisition projects and thus are likely to find it challenging to continue with such projects. The indications from Tsogo Sun, a hotel operator in South Africa, are that it might be a challenge for some hoteliers to meet their debt obligations over a prolonged period of low hotel occupancies. There were already indications from the US market that some enterprises had already defaulted on the payment of rentals and leases as of April 2020, ranging into millions of dollars (Schoening and Shapiro 2020). Towns and municipalities were likely to be affected, especially those that rely on tourism business revenue for their rates and taxes. The financial collapse was likely to result in businesses defaulting on their rates and taxes. Small municipalities such as the town of Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe have been bankrupted as a result of the pandemic and are most likely to struggle to raise adequate cash for their employees and social services due to a decline in revenue. South African hotels and lodges in Cape Town which were just emerging from one of the worst droughts to have affected the Western Cape have also been badly affected by the pandemic as they do not have enough cash reserves to rescue the situation. Following the wildfires in the Australia, where most resort towns battled and encountered severe losses, the tourism businesses had gone from bad to worse in terms of meeting its financial obligations, as areas in Victoria and New South Wales have yet to recover from the devastating impact of the fires that ended earlier in 2020. The pandemic also had severe ramifications for vacation rentals such as Airbnb. With the COVID-19 affecting millions, the vacation rental and home-sharing companies were also as severely disrupted as their hotel counterparts as a result of travel cancellations. In particular, the blanket cancellations suffered by Airbnb left the owners vulnerable, with no income to pay for bonds and other associated rates. This caused a flurry of online complaints, petitions and lawsuits leading the company to set up a $250 million facility in order to compensate hosts for up to 25% of their lost income (Schaal 2020 ). An additional $10 million bailout was sought for bailing out superhosts. The cancellations came at a high cost to the company as it was billed for public listing some time in 2020. In 2019, the market value for Airbnb was set at $31 billion up from nothing 11 years back (Sherwood 2020). However, due to the pandemic and poor management of cancellations and refunds, the company plunged to almost half the value. The company was valued at 18 billion dollars as of April 2020 (Eaglesham and Grind 2020) . In light of the depreciated value, it remains to be seen whether the company will proceed with its initial planned public offering. Given the disgruntlement, there is evidence that some property owners took their property off short-term rentals, which might signal that property owners are going to put those properties up for long-term rentals. Figure 8 .7 shows that all the sampled countries have reported a decline in the number of active properties. This has affected the annual returns and profitability of Airbnb. For property, the immediate future is bleak with the volume of cancellations very high and future bookings very low. There is, therefore, a need for property owners outside the USA to look for ways of paying the fixed expenses on their properties which might mean months of losses. The status quo brought into question the sustainability of business models adopted by companies such as Uber and Airbnb, which transfers all the risk to the service provider, while they take all the profits and no substantive risks. A better and more equitable and workable model has to be found to address such disparities.@story_separate@The study investigated the impact of COVID-19 on the global hotel and Airbnb tourism sector. It emerged that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating short-to medium-term impact. The pandemic has led to a spike in booking 8.5 Conclusion and Recommendations cancellations as witnessed on five platforms from which the data were collected, namely, Agoda, Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia and Hotelbeds. A spike in cancellations and a decline in bookings has left many hotels vulnerable to the impact of financial losses. The pandemic also came at a higher cost to Airbnb, which has lost close to 50% of the company's market value. Cancellations for Airbnb have left property owners vulnerable to fixed expenses of property ownership such as rates, taxes and loan repayments. Faced with imminent business collapse, hotel organisations globally have resorted to massive job layoffs and furloughs with adverse impacts on employees as most hotels temporarily closed shop. As the chapter was being finalised, there was a real danger than most hotels would not be able to meet their financial obligations such as loan repayments and servicing of rates. Most global hotel groups deferred or cancelled the payment of dividends to shareholders and suspended capital expenditure. Initial assessment showed that for the tourism industry alone, hundreds of billions of dollars in potential revenue was lost. The figure could translate into trillions of dollars if one considers the knock-on effect of hotel shutdowns on the entire tourism value chain. In light of the enormous liquidity challenges that were being faced by the tourism industry, especially hotels and Airbnb, there was a need for state and private sector intervention in the form of stimulus packages. Such stimulus packages would assist the industry to get back on track as soon as the disaster is over, and therefore a full chapter is dedicated to this in this book. It is anticipated that the first revival will come from the domestic tourism markets. The promotion of domestic tourism would offer much-needed relief to the industry as states were likely to open up to the domestic tourism market before they open up to the international markets. (2020)) Incentivising the domestic tourism market could offer the needed relief sooner than the international tourism market. Governments could assist in waiving some of the taxes and charges as part of the relief package for the sector. Assisting employees with unemployment benefits could go a long way in relieving the burden from laid-off employees in the interim, but long-lasting solutions have to be found to assist laid-off employees. Fortunately, some of these interventions were already in place, as the chapter was being finalised. The tourism industry also includes many small to medium enterprises that needed special stimulus packages if they are to remain viable as they are more vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic. In the absence of medication for the coronavirus, there was a need for the industry to be allowed to also open with new health and safety protocols that ensure the safety of guests and staff. A new deep cleaning mechanism was needed to ensure that the disease does not spread in accommodation establishments. In ensuring safety and health, it was imperative to ensure the existence and grafting of social distancing in hotels and hotel restaurants. Innovative technology such as contactless check-in and payments was a must to instil a sense of safety among guests. As such there was a need for the industry to come with health and certification scheme that shows the adherence of hotel and other accommodation to global health and safety that takes into consideration the new normal under COVID-19. Lastly, the chapter recommends further regional, national and local studies to ascertain the extent of the impact and industry response to COVID-19. Such work would assist the industry to better prepare for future pandemics when they occur.","While the tourism industry was on a steady growth path up to 2019, it remains sensitive and vulnerable to natural and political shocks. Such shocks have been on the increase in the recent past. Of concern has been the increase in diseases and pandemics which have become more prevalent since 2000 to 2020. As a result of the interlinkages in the tourism industry, disease outbreaks are often disruptive to global tourism economies. This chapter assesses the impact of COVID-19 on the hotel industry and shared accommodation in the form of Airbnb. Using critical document analysis and tracking hotel bookings from machine learning data for five top global online travel agencies and the American Hotel and Lodging Association, among other authoritative sources, the study found that COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the sector. COVID-19 has led to massive booking cancellations and record low bookings with adverse effects on annual accommodation bookings for 2020 globally. This has, in turn, resulted in hotel closures and empty rooms for Airbnb properties. The slump in business has further led to record high hotel employee layoffs and/or furloughs, while Airbnb property owners battle to pay fixed expenses and mortgages on their properties. In addition, most global hotel chains have cancelled dividend payments and postponed capital expenditure to avoid bankruptcy and industry collapse. There are real fears that the impact of the pandemic, far exceeding previous disasters such as SARS, will reverse the gains and the contribution made towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. This study recommends the scaling up of several government and private sector relief funds and other measures aimed at assisting both the industry and its employees hardest hit by COVID-19. Particular attention should be given to small- to medium-size enterprises and establishments in developing countries."
"In March 2020, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic, and as of 26 October 2020, over 42 000 000 confirmed cases have been diagnosed in more than 130 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 1 150 000 deaths. 1 COVID-19 has led to over 100 countries enforcing social distancing to reduce the rate of COVID-19 transmission, commonly called 'lockdown'. 2 The severity of lockdown has varied from country to country, even region to region, with some countries limiting the distance people could travel from their homes, and some banning any unnecessary outdoor activity. 2 These lockdowns have impacted people's work, education, travel and recreation, and subsequent levels of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviours (SB). 3 PA can be defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscle that results in energy expenditure, 4 and can include exercising, walking, gardening and doing household chores. Research shows that PA is positively associated with several desirable outcomes, including social contentedness, 5 physical health 6 and mental health. 7 8 Specific to COVID-19, PA has been shown to improve physical and mental health and has been suggested to provide protective elements against COVID-19. 9-11 Furthermore, it has been reported that the COVID-19 lockdown yielded decreases in PA, 12 however, the literature has not been systematically reviewed to date. SB can be defined as any waking behaviour with an energy expenditure of ≤1.5 Metabolic What are the new findings? ► The majority of studies show that PA levels decreased during the COVID-19 lockdown across all reviewed populations, except for eating disorder patients. ► The majority of studies show that SB levels increased. ► Public health strategies should include the promotion of PA and effective guidance on how to decrease SB during a lockdown, especially in populations with medical conditions that are improved by PA, such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes.@story_separate@Equivalents (METs) while in a sitting or reclining posture, 13 including watching TV, video gaming and computer use. The literature has shown SB to be negatively associated with physical, mental health and social outcomes. 14 15 Specific to COVID-19, it has been reported that periods of enforced quarantine can yield increases in SB, 9-13 16 however, this has not been systematically assessed to date in the context of the COVID-19 lockdown. Understanding the changes in PA and SB behaviours during lockdown is important not only for health outcomes associated with these behaviours, but also for aiding development of public health interventions in specific populations (such as PA promotion and interventions to decrease SB) should another lockdown be enforced, a similar pandemic scenario and/or during the return to 'normal life'. 17 The aim of this study, therefore, was to conduct a comprehensive systematic review on changes in all reported PA and SB behaviours during versus before the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, stratifying between adults and children, and special populations. The current systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 18 Details of the full protocol for this systematic review were registered on PROSPERO (protocol number: CRD42020193065). Full information on database-specific search strategies can be found in online supplemental table 1. Results of the searches were included in a bibliographic database and duplicates removed. Titles and abstracts of the retrieved studies were screened for inclusion by two reviewers independently (SS and MT), and then the full text of all potentially eligible papers was reviewed independently by the same reviewers before making a final decision on eligibility. Any discrepancies were discussed until a decision was achieved. A third senior reviewer acted as an adjudicator if a decision was not reached (LS). Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) observational cross-sectional, prospective or retrospective cohort studies (2) that investigate any form of PA and/or SB (as defined by the authors) (3) in any population (healthy or with a specific disease condition) (4) before and during the COVID-19 Lockdown (5) in any setting. Published articles that had received ethical approval from an ethics committee and were written in English were included. Studies were excluded if they were not observational in design (eg, qualitative, primary randomised controlled trials, primary case series, editorials or commentaries or study protocols). Furthermore, the rapid publication of studies related to COVID-19 meant many bypassed the typical institutional ethical approval process; therefore, studies were excluded if they failed to explicitly include an explicit statement stating that institutional ethical approval was received. If no ethical approval was in the manuscript, corresponding authors were contacted to establish if institutional approval had been granted. If no reply was received, or institutional ethics was confirmed as being not obtained, these studies were excluded (see online supplemental table 2). The coprimary outcomes were changes in PA and/or SB captured via device-based measures or self-report tools. Data were extracted by two reviewers (SS and MT) independently including: first author, year, country, aims of the study, type of the study (pretest and post-test, crosssectional, cohort), descriptions of the lockdown by the authors for the respective location of data collection, number of participants, participant characteristics (eg, age, sex), inclusion criteria, type of recruitment, type and definition of PA and SB investigated, type of measurement of PA and SB, confounding variables, acknowledged limitations by authors and authors conclusions, other/ notes. A third reviewer (LS) was available to resolve any discrepancies. The data was synthesised in a narrative approach. Quality assessment Risk of bias was assessed by two independent reviewers (SS and MT) using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), 19 later adapted for cross-sectional studies. 20 A third reviewer (LS) was available to resolve any inconsistences. There are three parts in which studies are assessed and stars awarded: (1) selection (max. 5 stars)-representativeness of the sample, sample size, non-respondents and ascertainment of the exposure (risk factor); (2) comparability (max. 2 stars)-participants in different outcome groups are comparable; (3) outcome (max. 3 stars)assessment of outcome, and statistical test. Scores can range from 0 to 10 stars, with higher scores indicating better quality research. After initial screening, 187 studies were eligible for fulltext review. From these, 66 studies 12 21-84 were eligible for inclusion. The PRISMA flow chart is shown in online supplemental figure 1. Full study characteristics can be found in online supplemental table 3. The 66 included studies yielded a total of 86 981 participants and the age ranged from 13 to 86 years old. Regarding specific populations, forty-five studies were conducted on healthy adults (four in specifically elite athletes and five in university students), and six studies in healthy children. Regarding populations with medical conditions, two studies were conducted on adult women with eating disorders, two respective studies with adult participants with type 1 and types 2 diabetes, one respective study with adult participants with 'chronic medical conditions', one study on heart failure patients, one study on neuromuscular disease, one study on obesity clinic patients, one study on participants with a 'perceived risk' of severe COVID-19 symptoms, one study on pregnant women and one study reported on children with obesity. The mean NOS score of the included studies was 4.8 (SD=1.0; range 3-7;). For detailed NOS scoring, see online supplemental table 4. Forty-five studies examined PA changes in healthy adults, with only four studies 31 Of the studies that measured PA change in the form of time spent on PA, all but one study 70 reported overall decreases in the amount of PA pre-COVID-19 versus post-COVID-19 lockdown. When stratifying across different forms of PA, two studies 27 28 reported increases in time spent in 'leisure-time PA' and one study 85  Of the six studies that examined PA changes in healthy children and adolescents, all were measured using subjective questionnaires, with half using validated questionnaires. Two studies 48 84 used total scores from validated questionnaires and two studies 65 82 reported PA changes in the form of a time measurement, all reporting decreases in PA. Two studies 62 71 reported PA changes as a percentage of the respective population and reported >50% of the population decreased their PA during lockdown. Thirteen studies examined populations with medical conditions for which all but one study, 80 used subjective measurements of PA change, and in only 6/12 were these previously validated measurement tools. Regarding the types of changes reported, nine studies 23  Of the five studies that measured changes in SB in children and adolescents, three studies 42 62 65 used non-validated questionaries and the remaining two studies 71 82 used validated questionaries. Time spent in SB was reported in 3/5 studies, with the remaining two studies reporting changes in SB as a percentage of their respective populations. All five studies reported increases in SB. All of the three 26 43 86 studies that measured changes in SB in special populations used non-validated questionnaires, and reported that time spent in SB increased during the lockdown. The current systematic review of 66 studies demonstrated that the majority of studies found that PA declined and SB increased during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, regardless of the subpopulation or the methodology used. In healthy adults and children, PA during lockdown decreased compared with prelockdown, despite various government organisations and health or exercise practitioners providing guidance on how to stay active during the pandemic and in self-quarantine. [87] [88] [89] When stratifying between prelockdown PA levels, three studies found that people who were more active prelockdown were more likely to show larger decreases in PA. 37 49 67 Open access PA has also been consistently linked with several mental health conditions, suggesting that decreases in PA may lead to increases in undesirable mental health outcomes. Indeed, studies have shown significant increases in anxiety and depression levels during the lockdown. 10 Given that decreases in PA have been shown to yield negative affect, increases in anxiety and lower energy levels, 39 PA promotion during lockdowns should be aimed not just as people who are currently sedentary, but also for those with high PA levels outside of lockdown. Due to the likelihood of further COVID-19-related restrictions (or another similar pandemic), the promotion of digital based PA (such as PA apps, online video fitness classes or physical training) is recommended. Digital based PA yielded favourable results during the first COVID-19 lockdown, with studies showing positive associations with such digital based initiatives and overall PA during a lockdown. 83 Another finding of this review was that participants who had medical conditions also yielded decreases in PA levels, except for patients with an eating disorder. The decreases in PA is particularly concerning as in several of the medical conditions studied because PA can be a form of treatment or symptom alleviation. For example, levels of PA have been shown to be positively associated with quality of life outcomes in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. 90 91 Concurrently, increases in SB have been shown to yield detrimental outcomes in patients with these conditions, except for patients with eating disorder. 92 93 Given these added risks of decreasing PA and increasing SB in these special populations, PA promotion and strategies to reduce SB should be implemented should further lockdowns occur. Moreover, practitioners working with these groups should be especially mindful of the detriment that decreasing PA and increasing SB could yield during lockdowns and make the monitoring of PA levels a priority. Patients with eating disorders were found to increase their PA, specifically exercise, during lockdowns. This is equally concerning as there is often pathological relationship between eating disorders and exercise and can lead to increased risks of physical complications such as stress fractures. 94 Therefore, practitioners working with patients with eating disorders are advised to keep closely monitoring patients as much as possible during future lockdowns. There were also large decreases in both the training volume and training intensity of elite athletes while in lockdown, which has led to relative decreases in sportspecific physical performance tests post-lockdown. 85 This decrease in athletic readiness for competition should be noted and considered by practitioners who are working with elite athletes, especially regarding training loads and competition scheduling postlockdown. According to the behavioural change wheel, for a behaviour-for example, PA or SB-to occur, there are three components that are required: capability (psychological and physical), opportunity (physical and social) and motivation (reflective and automatic). 95 Despite information on safe exercise during lockdown being available from exercise professionals and some governments (psychological capability), it is not clear from the included studies the reasons why people did or did not engage in PA; however, we can speculate potential reasons for these findings. A reduction in PA is expected as lockdowns required that governments closed sport and leisure facilities, group activities were suspended, and in many countries limits were in place for time spent outdoors. 96 This potentially meant people's regular PA routines were difficult to continue with during lockdown, as indicated by the evidence stating that people considerably changed their modes of PA during lockdown. 97 For example, one study found that all types of PA decreased except for 'moderate intensity leisure-time PA' (such as housework and gardening) increased, 26 another found that 'yard work' increased, 77 and another found that 'housework' increased during lockdown. 82 However, despite these mode-specific increases, total PA levels in these respective populations still decreased. This suggests that promoting increases in house-related PA may not be sufficient to increase total PA during lockdowns. There was also an increase in the number of people working from home during lockdown, 98 consequently, PA ordinarily accumulated during commuting will have substantially decreased. A previous study found that adults in the UK (mean age 50.5 years) accumulated 195 min/ week (±188.6) of active travel. 99 Those who actively commute report significantly greater total PA than those who do not, despite no significant differences in recreational PA shown. 99 100 In addition, with schools closed, many parents were balancing home schooling, while working from home themselves; in the UK, this was the case for 85% of employees with school-aged children. 101 A decrease in opportunities to be active and additional responsibilities may have led to a decrease in PA. The majority of the studies in this review showed increases in SB during lockdown. This is unsurprising as many people worked from home, leading to extended sedentary periods and increased screen time. 102 103 For instance, de Haas et al 104 reported that 44% of Dutch workers had either started to work from home or increased their home working hours, with 30% reporting increases in remote meetings (eg, via videoconferencing). In addition, with most gyms, leisure and sporting facilities closed, time allowed outdoors limited or not allowed, some people may have found it difficult to be active during the lockdown. 3 105 With increased 'free' time, many may resort to engaging in pastimes such as reading, playing video games and watching television (TV), many of which are sedentary. 67 Given that the majority of studies reported a decrease in PA with a concurrent increase in SB during the lockdown, and the impact of these on physical and mental health, it is recommended that interventions or policies are implemented to increase PA (eg, body weight homeworkouts, using online exercise classes, walking, running and cycling outdoors) and decrease SB (eg, by using a standing desk and taking regular breaks from sitting) should further lockdowns be enforced in the future. In addition, interventions for PA and/or SB postlockdown should consider that individuals may suffer deconditioning as a result of the lockdowns. Many of the included studies used surveys to gather information about 'exercise', 'PA, 'sport' and 'training' but failed to report on how these terms were defined to participants. Future studies should report these definitions for clarity and comparison to be made more easily between studies. This lack of definition may mean that despite 'exercise' and 'training' decreasing, changes in daily PA may be different in these studies. Monbiot 106 reports volunteers providing food packages, collecting medical supplies for the elderly, providing childcare for those in need, meaning they potentially accumulate similar or more 'activity' than they realise as it is not prescribed 'exercise' or 'training'. It is important to note different degrees of lockdown in different countries, even regions within a country, across different dates occurred, making it difficult to quantify the severity of a lockdown and therefore challenging to objectively assess how this impacted behaviours. For instance, those in countries that were able to exercise outdoors following social distancing guidelines may have engaged differently in PA/SB behaviours to those who were not able to leave home, despite both countries being in 'lockdown'. Although the authors have presented the lockdown descriptions for each included study as reported by the authors, these description vary greatly in detail, making it challenging to categorise them into 'levels' of lockdown. The creation of a scale to indicate lockdown severity would be highly beneficial for comparisons to be made between countries when investigating different behaviours, or at the very least it is recommended that this type of information is reported in all future studies. Moreover, within countries some people are given specific guidance (eg, shielding) which requires more intensive lockdown than the general populationnone of the included studies recorded this information. It may be beneficial to know participants adherence to lockdown guidelines to provide an indication of potential opportunity to engage in PA. Most studies also report PA without investigating in detail the types, intensities and durations of PA engaged in before and during lockdown, thus, it would be beneficial to investigate these as the magnitude of changes will impact the effects on health. While this systematic review is the first to our knowledge to assess changes in the frequency and modes of PA and SB preockdown versus during the COVID-19 lockdown, the findings should be considered within the limitations of the study. First, the tools used to measure PA and SB were highly heterogeneous, making direct comparison of respective results difficult. Second, demographic information was largely limited, meaning that we were unable to assess any further changes according to demographics further than the discussed topics, which would have given more insight into the review. In addition, the vast majority of studies were based on subjective questionnaires, which carry with them inherent limitations. 107 Moreover, many studies asked participants retrospectively about their prelockdown behaviours and their current behaviours during lockdown, thus, the accuracy of participants abilities to accurately recall their behaviours may be questionable. Lastly, most of the studies included were not designed to be nationally representative, making the generalisation of these results difficult. Future research in this area should focus on yielding directly comparable data using validated PA and SB questionnaires or using objective accelerometer data where possible. In addition, it would be beneficial to have more detailed demographic information, information on the severity of lockdown and participant adherence to lockdown guidelines, and more detailed information on PA behaviours, for instance, the types, intensities and duration of PA before and during lockdown. Future research should also consider investigating the magnitude of the decrease in PA and increases in SB across different populations during the lockdown to aid the identification of populations most in need of targeted interventions. Lastly, future research should consider investigating the reasons why people are showing changes in PA and/or SB. Using behavioural change theory to assess barriers and facilitators to PA/SB during lockdowns would be highly beneficial in the creation of future interventions and policies should lockdowns occur in the future.@story_separate@During the COVID-19 lockdown, PA levels have significantly reduced with concurrent increases in SB. Considering the evidence of favourable outcomes of higher levels of PA and lower levels of SB in both physical and mental health outcomes, and the emerging evidence that exercise can yield favourable COVID-19 outcomes, it is recommended that public health officials promote ways of increasing PA and reducing SB should further lockdowns occur, especially in populations with medical conditions that are improved by PA, such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Interventions designed for postlockdown should also consider that individuals may suffer from deconditioning during the lockdown period, especially in athletic populations and people with medical conditions.","OBJECTIVE: In March 2020, several countries banned unnecessary outdoor activities during COVID-19, commonly called ‘lockdowns. These lockdowns have the potential to impact associated levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Given the numerous health outcomes associated with physical activity and sedentary behaviour, the aim of this review was to summarise literature that investigated differences in physical activity and sedentary behaviour before vs during the COVID-19 lockdown. DESIGN, DATA SOURCES AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Electronic databases were searched from November 2019 to October 2020 using terms and synonyms relating to physical activity, sedentary behaviour and COVID-19. The coprimary outcomes were changes in physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour captured via device-based measures or self-report tools. Risk of bias was measured using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Sixty six articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review (total n=86 981). Changes in physical activity were reported in 64 studies, with the majority of studies reporting decreases in physical activity and increases in sedentary behaviours during their respective lockdowns across several populations, including children and patients with a variety of medical conditions. CONCLUSION: Given the numerous physical and mental benefits of increased physical activity and decreased sedentary behaviour, public health strategies should include the creation and implementation of interventions that promote safe physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour should other lockdowns occur."
"According the situation report from World Health Organization (WHO), more than In a very short time, the structures of functional proteins essential for SARS-CoV-2 were achieved by groups in China, including the main protease and spike protein in binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Although the structures of other proteins remain unknown, the high amino acid identity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (77.2%) enables that it is possible to establish the homology modeled structures of SARS-CoV-2 based on the protein structures of SARS-CoV with high confidence. Thus, we built and collected the protein structures as potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 according to those of SARS-CoV. A web-server, COVID-19 Docking Server, was constructed to facilitate people to evaluate the binding modes and binding affinities between these targets and small molecules, peptides as well as antibodies. By launching the server, we'd like to provide a free and easy to use tool for people who is interested in drug discovery against COVID-19.@story_separate@The flow chart of the COVID-19 Docking Server is shown in Figure 1 . For small molecule docking, Autodock Vina 4 is used as docking engine. Two computational type are provided with the default computational type as ""Docking"" (D) to dock single small molecule to the target, and the other option ""Screening"" (S) to dock a number of small molecules to the target. The protein structures of COVID-19 targets were extracted and prepared by MGLTools 1.5.6. User only needs to upload the small molecules in smi, mol2 or sdf formats. Open Babel was used for format transformation or 3D coordinate generation for the uploaded files 5 . Then ligand_prepare.py from MGLTools 1.5.6 is used to convert the ligand files into pdbqt format with Gasteiger charge added. The box center for docking was defined according to the information of active sites or binding sites of its homologs of SARS-CoV. All the parameters are set as default except the exhaustiveness value is set to 12 to achieve higher accuracy.  The structures of functional or structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were collected or built based on its homologs of coronavirus by using homology modeling module of Maestro 10 (www.schrodinger.com). All the targets were prepared and available for peptides or antibodies docking on the website. For small molecule docking, the docking box was carefully defined for every specific target. Only the targets with enzyme active site, substrate binding site or inhibitor binding site were prepared and set for small molecule docking. The detailed information about the targets is described as below. Main protease (Mpro): It is also named as chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro).  The surface spike glycoprotein is consisting of three S1-S2 heterodimers. The receptor binding domain (RBD) located on the head of S1 and bind with the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), initiating the membrane fusion of the virus and host cell. Recently, the structure of spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with human ACE2 was released by Wang and Zhang's group in Tsinghua University. The structure was downloaded and prepared for protein docking. We also built the monomer and trimer structure of full length spike protein based on 6ACG and prepared for protein docking 13 .  ion channel, also named as E channel. The structure of E channel was built based on 5X29 15 . Both the monomer and the pentamer were prepared for protein docking. And the E channel structure was also prepared for small molecule docking with the center of ion channel defined as box center in docking. The M protein involves in most of protein-protein interactions required for assembly of coronaviruses and it is also determined as a protective antigen in humoral responses 16 . The structure of M protein was built by using I-TASSER server and prepared for protein docking [17] [18] [19] .  For each job of small molecule docking, the user can choose one of the COVID-19 targets. The small molecules should be uploaded in strict smi, mol2 or sdf formats. The user needs to choose the computational modes before uploading the small molecule files: if ""Docking"" is selected, only one small molecule should be uploaded, and top 10 binding modes will be displayed on the result page. If ""screening"" is selected, 10-20 molecules should be uploaded, and the top 10 molecules ranked by the scoring function will be displayed on the result page. If 1-10 molecules need to be evaluated, then the user has to upload the molecules one by one and choose the ""Docking"" mode. After the submission, an email will be sent to user's email address, containing a directed link to access the docking results. After the job completes, the user could enter the job ID to access the result page. By default, the server only displays the top 10 models. The selected COVID-19 protein target is renamed as Input_R.pdb. The top 10 models are named as TopL1.pdb-TopL10.pdb, respectively. The scored file is named as Score.dat. The models are visualized in 3D by JSmol and the user can view and download the docking results from the result page. Here, we take Papain-like protease and its inhibitor as an example for small molecule docking 7 . The ""Docking"" mode was selected and the mol2 format of its inhibitor in PDB 4OW0 was uploaded as ligand. For the top rank binding modes, the predicted binding energies of Top 1 and 2 were -11.5 kcal/mol and -10.7 kcal/mol, and the L_RMSDs were 0.23Å and 3.60 Å, respectively. As shown in Figure 4A , the best binding mode of the inhibitor is very similar to the complex structure. Similar to small molecule docking, the user needs to choose the COVID-19 protein target and uploads ligand protein (peptide or antibody) in strict pdb format for peptide or antibody docking. The protein docking server can perform global docking and sitespecific docking to predict the binding mode between COVID-19 protein target and peptide (or antibody). The user could enter one residue into either the receptor box or the ligand box, or he could enter one residue into receptor box and one into the ligand box simultaneously. If only one residue on the ligand or receptor is defined, then the conformations with the specific residue on the interface of the complex are retained. When the user defines one residue on the receptor and the other one on the ligand simultaneously, then he needs to choose the constraint type: ambiguous constraints 13 or multiple constraints. When the ""ambiguous constraints"" is selected, the conformations are retained with at least one selected residue on the interface. When the ""multiple constraints"" is selected, the conformations are retained with both of the residues on the interface. We use the post-fusion state of S2 segment of spike protein as an example for peptide docking. The receptor is 5-helices structure extracted from the post-fusion state of 6helices S2. One helix was extracted from the S2 structure and used as ligand peptide. The pdb file of ligand peptide was uploaded and the default global docking mode was chosen. In our example, the predicted binding energies of Top 1 and 2 binding modes were -532.3 kcal/mol and -374.3 kcal/mol, and the L_RMSDs were 0.77 Å and 2.62 Å, respectively. As shown in Figure 4B , the best binding mode is very similar to the 6helices structure of spike protein. @story_separate@The structures of potential targets of COVID-19 were collected or built based on the homology structures of coronavirus. An online interactive server, COVID-19 Docking Server, was constructed to predict the binding modes between the targets and small molecules, peptides or antibodies by implement of Autodock Vina and CoDockPP as docking engines. The server provides a user-friendly interface and binding mode visualization for the results, which makes it a useful tool for drug discovery of COVID-19.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from China and led to thousands of death globally since December 2019. Despite many groups have engaged in studying the newly emerged virus and searching for the treatment of COVID-19, the understanding of the COVID-19 target -ligand interactions represents a key challenge. Herein, we introduce COVID-19 Docking Server, a web server that predicts the binding modes between COVID-19 targets and the ligands including small molecules, peptide and antibody. Structures of proteins involved in the virus life cycle were collected or constructed based on the homologs of coronavirus, and prepared ready for docking. The platform provides a free and interactive tool for the prediction of COVID-19 target-ligand interactions and following drug discovery for COVID-19."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city of China in December 2019 and rapidly spread as an atypical pneumonia pandemic with unknown causes throughout the country within one month. On January 8, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified the causative pathogen of this disease as 2019-nCoV [1] ; however, later, this virus was officially named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses Coronavirus Study Group [2] . With the identification of the disease, infections have rapidly increased within a short period of time, and the disease exceeded regional limits, spreading globally. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced this pneumonia as an epidemic threatening international public health, and declared it as a pandemic on March 11. Thus, the world has faced the greatest pandemic of the recent history, with a coronavirus being the cause of a pandemic for the first time in recorded history [3] . Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped single-chain RNA viruses from the Coronaviridae family and have very rapid mutation and recombination abilities [4] .The virus can cause a disease when it spreads from animals to humans while person-to-person transmission occurs by contact or the spread of droplets through sneezing/coughing [5] . The incubation period of COVID-19 ranges between 2 and 14 days (average 7 days) after the infection. The disease can be symptomatic or manifest as asymptomatic or mild respiratory tract infection. The disease can also manifest with a broad range of symptoms, such as muscle pain, fatigue, diarrhea, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory tract infection [6, 7] . In our clinical observations, some patients have complaints of taste and smell impairment in addition to these symptoms of the disease. In a study by Hjelmesaeth and Skaare, it was reported that the patients experienced loss of smell and taste as the only symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection [8] . Hendrik Streeck, a German virology professor, stated that at least two-thirds of all infected patients experienced loss of smell and taste [9] . Similarly, American otolaryngologists suggest that anosmia, hyposmia, and loss of taste must be included in the list of symptoms that will lead to COVID-19 suspicion in the lack of other explanatory conditions, and testing and isolation must be considered [10] . WHO also added loss of smell and taste to COVID-19 disease symptoms on May 4, 2020 [11] The COVID-19 pandemic, affecting the entire world, has caused the deaths of many people during a relatively short, in addition to having negative social, economic and political outcomes. A certain treatment has not yet been defined for COVID-19 pandemic. It is necessary to carry out intensive studies on this disease in Turkey, as in the whole world. In our study, we investigated the disturbances in the sense of taste and smell in COVID-19 patients at first presentation. Then, we performed a second test after 10 ± 2 days in cases with persistent taste and smell disorders. Thus, we aimed to present the changes in the taste and smell senses of COVID-19 patients over time.@story_separate@This study was prospectively carried out in the ear-nosethroat department of Erzincan Binali Yıldırım University Faculty of Medicine. This center has been designated by the Turkish government as a pandemic hospital to treat COVID-19 patients. The study included in-patients who were positive for COVID-19 according to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test between May 1 and June 20, 2020. The study was carried out in accordance with the principles of Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Erzincan University (decision no. 05/22), as well as approval from the Turkish Ministry of Health (scientific research no. 2020-04-29T15_22_34). Ninety-four COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Smell and taste tests were applied to all patients at first presentation. Ten days later, a second test was applied to the patients with impaired senses of smell to compare the results. Our study did not include patients who were taken into intensive care and intubated or those with a history of cerebral events. The psychophysical test of smell function was performed using Sniffin' Sticks test with commercially available felttip pens (Sniffin 'Sticks, Burghart GmbH, Wedel, Germany) [12, 13] . For smell presentation, the cap of the pen was removed by the experimenter for approximately 3 s, and the tip of the pen was placed approximately 1-2 cm in front of the patient's nostrils. Smell definition was evaluated using 16 common smells. The participants were asked to choose from a list of four possible definitive terms for each smell. Each smell compound was presented by the experimenter, and a pause of at least 30 s was provided to prevent desensitization to smell. The participants were free to sample the smells for durations required to make a decision. Test result was recorded as the total score of accurately identified smells [12, 13] . This test included the description of four solutions in water representing different types of taste. Four taste variables were prepared as follows: 50% sucrose for sweet taste, 0.9% saline solution for salty taste, 4.2% vinegar solution for sour taste, and 20% coffee solution (sugar free) for bitter taste [14] . The study was conducted during morning hours (9 a.m.-11 a.m.) to eliminate bias in the results due to circadian variation, and the participants were asked to avoid eating and drinking 1 h before the appointment. After rinsing their mouths with distilled water, the participants were given a chronometer to hold in their right hands to record the taste definition duration. Four essential flavors; i.e., sweet, salty, sour and bitter aqueous solutions were provided on paper strips at equal dimension and shape. The taste strips were placed on the front two-third of the tongue dorsum. After placing the strips, the taste recognition period (in seconds) measured by the participants was recorded for each flavor. The participants were asked to rinse their mouths thoroughly between the tests of each sample [14] . IBM SPSS v. 21.0 for Windows was used for the statistical analysis of the data. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was used to examine whether variables were distributed normally. Since the measurement results obtained did not indicate a normal distribution, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon test was used. Numbers (percentages) and median (Q1; Q3) values were used to summarize the data. p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Of the 94 COVID-19 patients included in the study, 55.3% (n = 52) were male and 44.7% (n = 42) were female, with the mean age being determined as 53 ± 19.6 (21-90) years. The smell and taste test results are given in Table 1 , and accordingly smell and taste impairment was present in 67 (71.2%) patients, of whom 34 (50.7%) had a smell disorder only, 3 (4.4%) had a taste disorder only, and 30 (44.7%) had both smell and taste disorders. Thirty-four (50.7%) of the patients with smell and taste disorders were male and 33 were female (49.3%), and their mean age was 55.7 ± 19.8 years. There was no significant difference in the taste and smell scores by gender (p > 0.05) ( Table 2) . Sixty-seven patients with smell and taste impairment were included in the second evaluation 10 ± 2 days after the first test. At this stage, the taste and smell tests were applied to a total of 55 patients since four patients had died. Five patients were in intensive care and three patients could not be contacted. The smell and taste test results for the second evaluation are given in Table 3 . It was found that the smell scores of the patients with smell and taste impairment in the first evaluation were significantly increased at the second measurement and their tasting period was significantly shortened compared to the first taste test (p < 0.001). As a result of these measurements. It was determined that the smelling complaint persisted in only 3 (5.4%) patients.  The COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent health condition affecting the whole world, as in all pandemics. Health care systems must create a rapid response against this disease. Revealing the signs and symptoms of the disease is important in terms of early treatment since it is caused by a new virus about which we have limited knowledge. There are no specific clinical symptoms which can clearly distinguish COVID-19 from other viral respiratory tract infections. After the outbreak of the pandemic, many authors reported that COVID-19 patients had a high rate of smell and taste problems [15] [16] [17] . While it is known that other viruses such as influenza also show this symptom. It has been reported that every contact in COVID-19 infection presents a measurable impairment of smell [18] . In a study conducted by Beltrán-Corbellini et al., new smell and taste impairment was observed at a significantly higher rate in COVID-19 patients compared to influenza cases [19] . These symptoms can be observed especially during the early stages of the disease or they can be the only clinical symptoms of the disease [15, 16] . Angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors are commonly found in oral mucosa and nasal mucosa epithelium cells. It has been reported that ACE-2 receptors play an essential role in the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 to the main host cell and the mechanism causing smell and taste impairment was related to this condition [20, 21] . The current study was planned as qualitative research to measure the smell and taste functions of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to explain the relationship between the disease and impairment in these senses and investigate the change in these senses in the course of the disease. We found that 67 of the 94 patients (71.2%) had loss of smell or taste. of whom 34 (50.7%) had smell impairment only 3 (4.4%) had taste impairment only. and 30 (44.7%) had both smell and taste impairment. In a study conducted in Iran. Moein et al. reported that 35% of COVID-19 patients had loss of smell or taste. In the same study, the authors determined that 12% of patients experienced loss of smell only. 7% experienced loss of taste only and 17% experienced loss of both senses [18] . The rates of in that study are lower than our results which may be associated with the differences in the test methods used. In a survey study conducted with COVID-19 patients in Italy, approximately 34% of patients reported loss of smell or taste [17] . The rates reported in that study are also lower than our rates. However, the previous authors' account of the loss of smell and taste was solely based on the statements of the patients in contrast to measurements performed in our study. In another study undertaken by Altin et al. in Turkey. 67.1% of patients had loss of smell or taste. 35.8% had loss of smell only. 1% had loss of taste only and 24.6% had loss of both smell and taste [22] which is consistent with our results. Another study in Iran showed that women's smell scores were better, if not significantly different, than men (17. 18) . Similar to the later work we did not observe statistically significant differences in smell and taste impairment between the male and female COVID-19 patients. In studies conducted to date, COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals have been compared in terms of smell and taste impairment [18, 22] . It has been reported that COVID-19 patients have significantly higher smell and taste impairment. In our study, healthy individuals were not included in the sample as a control group. A study group consisting of only COVID-19 patients was examined in terms of their smell and taste functions at first presentations compared to a second evaluation undertaken on average 10 days later. According to the second test results, existing smell and taste impairment had decreased significantly. Although the literature contains studies related to the loss of smell and taste in COVID-19 patients, our study is the first to examine how these complaints of the patients changed in the acute and recovery periods of the disease. In this aspect, we consider that our study is original and our data will contribute to the literature.@story_separate@COVID-19 patients present to medical institutions with a broad variety signs and symptoms. It has been found that impairment in the senses of smell and taste is common in this disease and they are strongly associated with the COVID-19 infection. The results obtained in our study support that smell and taste impairment is very common especially in the acute period of the disease and this is a reliable indicator of the disease. In addition, we determined that smell and taste impairment was mostly temporary and improved during the recovery period. However, considering that there are many unknown aspects of the disease it has not yet been elucidated whether this impairment is permanent. There is a need for more detailed, multi-centered and long-term studies with a higher number of more patients on this subject. The results of our study support that identification of infected patients who do not have any particular symptom other than smell and taste impairment is very important in terms of measures to be taken to prevent the transmission of the disease to uninfected people. Author contributions İS, SS, and FK made substantial contributions to the conception and design of the study acquisition and data analysis and","OBJECTIVE: It is known that the COVID-19 disease, which has affected the whole world, causes symptoms, such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, muscle pain, fatigue, diarrhea, headache and sore throat, in addition to various clinical findings, such as loss of smell and taste. In this study, we aimed to reveal the loss of sense of taste and smell in COVID-19 patients and to investigate whether these sensory losses are permanent in the healing process of the disease. METHOD: This prospective study included 94 COVID-19 patients. Smell and taste tests were applied to all patients. Ten days after the first test, a second test was applied to the patients with an impaired sense of smell to compare the results. RESULTS: Of the 94 patients, 55.3% were male, and the mean age was 53 ± 19.6 (21–90) years. There were 67 patients with smell and taste impairment, of whom 34 (50.7%) had smell impairment only, 3 (4.4%) had taste impairment only, and 30 (44.7%) had both smell and taste impairment. It was found that the smell scores of 55 patients with smell and taste impairment in the first evaluation were significantly higher at the second measurement; and their tasting period was significantly shortened compared to the first measurement (p˂0.001). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients may present to medical centers with a broad variety signs and symptoms. This study shows that impairment in the senses of smell and taste is common in this disease and strongly associated with COVID-19 infection. However, smell and taste impairment is mostly temporary and improves during the recovery period."
"The host immune system recognizes and responds to viral infections. Key responders of the innate immune system in anti-viral defense are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that target viral genomic DNA and RNA, such as single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Activation of PRRs leads to signal transduction cascades resulting in secretion of cytokines and development of adaptive immunity. Similar to viral nucleic acids, messenger (m)RNA-based vaccines and therapeutics activate the immune system through the same mechanisms based on PRR recognition, reviewed in [1] [2] [3] [4] . They represent a novel class of drugs and consist of synthetic mRNA packed into diverse types of shields that protect the mRNA from ribonucleases (RNases) and facilitate the transport and introduction of mRNA into the target cells, tissues, and organs. In vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA-encoded antigens (for vaccine and immunotherapy applications) or the protein of interest (for therapeutics as protein replacement therapies or antibody production) is commonly encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles (LNP). In protein replacement therapies, mRNA is engineered to code for an intracellular or secreted protein of interest [1, 5] . In typical cases, protein replacement aims to restore enzyme function to treat rare monogenic diseases. When LNP-encapsulated mRNA enters the cytoplasm, the cellular translational machinery reads the protein of interest from LNP-delivered mRNA matrices. The therapeutic protein is modified post-translationally in a host-cell specific manner, which is one of the major advantages compared with enzyme replacing therapies (ERT) that directly utilize protein administration [5] . Other advantages of mRNA over protein for protein replacement therapies are overcoming challenges in production and degradation of large Figure 1 . Schematic of RNA-induced immune activation. LNP-mRNA is endocytosed by cell-specific mechanisms. Small fractions of mRNA and byproducts of IVT reaction are released to cytoplasm by endosomal escape. In the cytoplasm, mRNA is translated by cellular machinery. In endosomes, U-rich ssRNA is sensed by TLR7 and TLR8, and dsRNA is detected by TLR3. The activation signal is transferred through the signal transduction cascade to the nucleus where the transcription factors NF-kB, IRF3, and IRF7 promote the production of cytokines. The released IFN-α and IFN-β are recognized by their receptor IFNAR, leading to the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and the formation of ISGF-3, which activates the transcription of multiple hundreds of genes including PKR, OAS, and ADAR. In the cytoplasm, 5′ppp dsRNA and 5′pp dsRNA are recognized by RIG-I, and long dsRNA by MDA5. Both pathways lead to the additional increase in NF-kB, IRF3, and IRF7. Moreover, dsRNA can also activate the inflammasome through NLRP1 or NLRP3, leading to the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 by caspase 1 and IL-1β and IL-18 release, or a GSDMD cleavage followed by pyroptosis. Created with BioRender.com. U-rich single-stranded mRNA is recognized by TLR7 and TLR8 [21, 22] . Its recognition leads to TLR activation, signal transduction through myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) adaptor protein, and tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF 6), leading to the activation of IκB kinase (IKK) complex, reviewed in [2, 23] . The IKK complex activates the NF-κB transcription factor (TF) that translocates to the nucleus where it induces the expression of type I interferons such as IFN-α and IFN-β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-12 . This triggers the Figure 1 . Schematic of RNA-induced immune activation. LNP-mRNA is endocytosed by cell-specific mechanisms. Small fractions of mRNA and byproducts of IVT reaction are released to cytoplasm by endosomal escape. In the cytoplasm, mRNA is translated by cellular machinery. In endosomes, U-rich ssRNA is sensed by TLR7 and TLR8, and dsRNA is detected by TLR3.

The released IFN-α and IFN-β are recognized by their receptor IFNAR, leading to the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and the formation of ISGF-3, which activates the transcription of multiple hundreds of genes including PKR, OAS, and ADAR. In the cytoplasm, 5 ppp dsRNA and 5 pp dsRNA are recognized by RIG-I, and long dsRNA by MDA5. Both pathways lead to the additional increase in NF-kB, IRF3, and IRF7. Moreover, dsRNA can also activate the inflammasome through NLRP1 or NLRP3, leading to the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 by caspase 1 and IL-1β and IL-18 release, or a GSDMD cleavage followed by pyroptosis. Created with BioRender.com. U-rich single-stranded mRNA is recognized by TLR7 and TLR8 [21, 22] . Its recognition leads to TLR activation, signal transduction through myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) adaptor protein, and tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF 6), leading to the activation of IκB kinase (IKK) complex, reviewed in [2, 23] . The IKK complex activates the NF-κB transcription factor (TF) that translocates to the nucleus where it induces the expression of type I interferons such as IFN-α and IFN-β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-12 . This triggers the pro-inflammatory response and both autocrine and paracrine secretion of IFNs. IFNs then activate the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) (JAK-STAT) pathway, leading to the formation of IFN stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF-3), which in turn translocates to the nucleus, further activating hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (the signaling cascades extensively reviewed in [2, 23, 24] ). These genes include PRRs and TFs, further amplifying the signal and leading to a boost of the immune system activation. In addition, ISGF-3 activates a number of genes having anti-viral/anti-RNA response functions, such as dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), 2 -5 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), and RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR) (Figure 1 ) (reviewed in [2, 20] ). The activated PKR can phosphorylate eIF2α transcription initiation factor, leading to the inhibition of translation and stimulation of IKK complex, thereby amplifying the innate immunity signals or leading to apoptosis [25] . Double-stranded RNA-activated OAS synthesizes 2 -5 -linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP, which activate RNAse L, leading to cleavage and degradation of ssRNA [26] . Portions of mRNA cleaved by RNase L bind and activate PRRs, further amplifying the type I IFN loop. An additional important mechanism of ISGF-3 gene activation includes an increase in Adenosine Deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes. ADAR1 has multiple functions. First, ADAR1 targets double-stranded regions of mRNA molecules, deaminates adenosine (A) to inosine (I), thus introducing I:U mismatches, which leads to mRNA destabilization [27] . Introduced mismatches may lead to change in the amino acid sequence of the coded protein, which results in a lower translational efficiency of mRNA [28, 29] . The second important function of ADAR1 is its role in the suppression of interferon signaling [30] . Liddicoat et al. generated mice with an editing-deficient knock in mutation [31] . Interestingly, embryonic death and phenotypes of these mice could be rescued when melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) was concurrently deleted. In this study, the authors established ADAR1 physiological function in editing endogenous RNA and preventing its sensing as a nonself by MDA5, thus suppressing IFN response [31] . Moreover, another study reported that the lethal phenotype of ADAR1 deletion in human cells was rescued when RNase L was concurrently deleted [32] . This showed that ADAR1 also blocks the OAS-RNase L pathway [32, 33] . While several in vitro studies suggested that ADAR1 also blocks RIG-I activation, this could not be confirmed in vivo, since editingdeficient mice could not be rescued with the concurrent deletion of RIG-I, requiring further studies (reviewed in [33] ). In summary, an important role of ADARs in balancing immune activation and self-tolerance was established [31, 33] . While U-rich ssRNA is sensed by TLR7 and TLR8, the dsRNA byproducts/contaminants are typically sensed in the endosomal compartment of macrophages by TLR3 [34, 35] (Figure 1 ). TLR3 further activates TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) and TNF receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF3), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and IKKε, respectively. This is followed by the activation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) 3 and 7, transcription factors that promote the production of type I IFNs, finally causing signal amplification and immune system activation through the already described pathways (reviewed in [2, 23] ). In both immune and non-immune cells, dsRNA is recognized by RLRs and NLRs (reviewed in [20, 36] ). RIG-I is a RLR that recognize 5 ppp dsRNA and 5 pp dsRNA [37] . This recognition requires the base pairing of the nucleoside carrying 5 ppp and its lack of N1-2'O-methylation [38, 39] . A long dsRNA (larger than 1kb) is recognized by MDA5 RLR [40, 41] . In both cases of dsRNA sensing by RIG-I and MDA5, the signal is transferred to mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and leads to the activation of the TBK1 and IKKξ [42] . dsRNA can also be recognized by two members of the NOD-like receptors family (NLRs): activated NLR family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1) or NLRP3, which, together with the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and caspase 1, builds the inflammasome that leads to the proteolytic maturation of IL-1β and IL-18 cytokines and inflammation [43, 44] . In addition, the activated caspase 1 cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) leading to pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of apoptosis [45] . Interestingly, Bauernfried et al. found that human NLRP1, but not murine NLRP1B, could be immunoprecipitated by dsRNA [44] . In eukaryotes, 5'ends of mRNAs consist of m7GpppNm (cap1) or m7GpppN1mN2m (cap2) where Nm is 2'-O-methylated nucleotide. The lack of methylation on cap0 (m7GpppN) can also lead to RIG-I activation, while using cap1 or cap2 decreases the induction of cytokines through the RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5, improving safety [41, 46] . Also, while the interferon (IFN)-induced tetratricopeptide repeat (IFIT) protein 1 (IFIT1), a known translation inhibitor, competes with eIF4E for binding to cap0, it shows a significantly lower affinity to cap1 and cap2 [47, 48] . The mechanisms described above suggest that the crude, non-purified IVT reaction containing non-optimized mRNA formulated to LNP-mRNA therapeutics can cause a boost and potential overreaction of the immune response, which may result in a decrease in translation, RNA degradation, and even apoptosis of the targeted cells. Thus, mRNA optimization and purification are crucial steps towards the development of LNP-mRNA with enhanced pharmacological and beneficial safety profile for mRNA-based non-immunotherapy applications.@story_separate@Another reason for immune activation by LNP-mRNA is mRNA formulation specificity. While liposomes and lipoplexes were the first formulations applied to mRNA, recently, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) formulation is widely utilized [49, 50] . LNPs were initially developed for the formulation of siRNAs [51, 52] . In 2018, the first LNP containing drug, Onpattro ® , the LNP-siRNA orphan medicinal product for the treatment of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, was approved [53, 54] . LNPs typically consist of four components: ionizable cationic lipids, structural lipids, cholesterol, and stealth coating lipids ( Figure 2 ). Amino or ionizable cationic lipids are pH-titratable lipids that allow for the entrapment of negatively charged mRNA due to their positive charge under acidic conditions during the formulation process. LNP-mRNAs containing ionizable cationic lipids are non-charged, but are protonated in endosomes with low pH, and help the endosomal release of mRNA by interacting with the negatively charged endosomal lipid bilayer (reviewed in [55, 56] ). While structural lipids allow the maintenance of the particle structure, cholesterol enhances particle stability, thereby most likely affecting LNP morphology and mRNA delivery [57, 58] . Stealth coating lipids such as polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid or polysarcosine (pSar) enable the control of physicochemical characteristics of the LNP-mRNA (e.g., particle size and the structure) and influence the circulation half-life of the particle [56, 59, 60] . Numerous studies have examined structure-activity relationships and revealed that properties of LNP such as particle size, charge, hydrophobicity, components molar fraction, and chemistry of the surface influence LNP interaction with the immune system [61] [62] [63] . Depending on their characteristics, LNPs can cause various in vivo immune effects: activation of immune cells, inflammation, adaptive immune response, and in some cases, complement activation and complement activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA) (Figure 2 ) [64] [65] [66] . Cationic lipid nanocarriers are recognized by TLR2 and TLR4 located on the cell surfaces of macrophages and other cells [67] [68] [69] . LNP-TLR's recognition triggers cytokine and chemokine secretion through similar pathways, as previously discussed for RNA-TLR recognition. Abrams et al. showed the induction of interleukin 1α (IL-1 α), IL-1 β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α after the intravenous (i.v.) application of 0.5-8 mg/kg LNP with or without siRNA to mice, indicating LNP components as primarily responsible for the observed innate immune response [70] . In the same study, more than 10-fold upregulation of at least one-third of 91 tested pro-inflammatory genes were observed indicating inflammation. Cationic lipid nanocarriers can also activate the NLRP3 component of the inflammasome and lead to inflammation [67] . components, ionizable cationic lipids, structural, stealth lipids, and cholesterol, determine LNP particle size, charge, hydrophobicity, and chemistries. Depending on their features, LNPs can lead to immune activation by activating TLR2 and TLR4 and executing signal transduction pathways leading to NF-kB activation and cytokine secretion. When PEG-lipid is used as a stealth lipid, anti-PEG antibodies can be formed leading to complement activation and subsequently complement mediated phagocytosis resulting in accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon, or, in rare cases, the release of multiple secondary mediators may occur, leading to complement related pseudoallergy (CARPA).

Cationic lipid nanocarriers can also activate the NLRP3 component of the inflammasome and lead to inflammation [67] . In most cases, currently used LNPs contain PEG lipids. PEG lipids sterically shield LNPs from interacting with other lipid particles or blood components, thus lowering LNP self-aggregation, opsonization, or phagocytosis [71] . PEG is widely used in cosmetics and the food industry. Immunogenicity of PEG is known since 1983, when the injection of PEGylated protein caused the production of anti-PEG antibodies in rabbits [72] . The wide usage of PEG in different industries leads to an increase in the percentage of healthy volunteers positive on anti-PEG antibodies, from 0.2% in 1984 to about 40% in 2016 (reviewed The lipid nanoparticle (LNP) components, ionizable cationic lipids, structural, stealth lipids, and cholesterol, determine LNP particle size, charge, hydrophobicity, and chemistries.

The wide usage of PEG in different industries leads to an increase in the percentage of healthy volunteers positive on anti-PEG antibodies, from 0.2% in 1984 to about 40% in 2016 (reviewed in [65, 73] ). Recently, a number of studies have shown the formation of anti-PEG IgM and, to a lower extent, IgG antibodies against LNPs and liposomes containing PEG-lipid in animal studies and in patients [65] . Anti-PEG antibodies hamper the efficacy of LNP-mRNAs, especially upon repetitive dosing (as required in non-immunotherapy applications) and can lead to increased safety risks [73] . The accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon was established as a term after Dams et al. revealed that the second dose of PEG-liposomes was rapidly cleared from the bloodstream of rats and rhesus monkeys while the first dose exhibited long circulation in the blood [74] . The ABC phenomenon depends on the time interval between applications (reviewed in [75] ). For example, while in most of the studies, a 7-days application interval of PEGylated nanoparticles leads to the strong ABC after the second dose, a 28-days interval leads to a significantly less clearance [75] . Except the time interval between injections, numerous other factors affecting ABC phenomenon, e.g., animal species, chemical and physicochemical properties of LNP, and dependance on encapsulated drug are established (reviewed in [65, 75, 76] ). In a recent study on pigs, Kozma et al. examined how PEG-coated liposomes affect hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) and found that the binding of anti-PEG IgM antibodies to PEGylated liposomes can lead to complement activation and CARPA [77] . CARPA represents the major mechanism of infusion reactions of which the pseudo-anaphylactic shock is the worst outcome. However, the development of infusion reactions highly depends on PEG characteristics as well as on immune system variability and previous PEG exposure in individuals. By now, more than 15 drugs with prominent examples, such as Doxil ® , Onpattro ® , BioNTech/Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (COMIRNATY ® ), and MODERNA COVID-19 VACCINE ® , containing PEG, are approved or have emergency authorizations by regulatory agencies [64] . These drugs are in use since the benefits of their application significantly outweigh the potential safety concerns, the majority of which originate from infusion reactions. While, typically, infusion reactions cause minor side effects (e.g., headache and muscle pain) that do not require further medical treatment, in rare cases, they can cause anaphylaxis and require treatment with epinephrine. Further studies and a better understanding of the mechanisms of immune activation and sporadic hypersensitive reactions that may be caused by LNP-mRNAs are needed. While an increase in the efficacy of the drug, allowing an improved clinical outcome as well as the lowering of dose and costs is a common aim of preclinical studies, safety is a prerequisite. Maximal safety through a decrease in potential side effects of LNP-mRNA applications is essential for RNA protein replacement therapies, including rare disease and other non-immunotherapy approaches. These LNP-mRNA-based applications typically require repetitive dosing through prolonged time-periods (e.g., until organ transplantation) or over a lifetime. Moreover, the introduction of relatively large doses, and, in some cases (such as those for rare inherited disease applications), targeting the already diseased organs, often early in life is needed. Current preclinical and clinical RNA-based protein replacement therapies (RPRTs) are summarized herein. The safety considerations described here for RPRT applications also apply for all LNP-mRNA-based non-vaccine and nonimmunotherapy applications such as monoclonal or bispecific antibody therapies used in oncology or infectious disease settings [78, 79] . Compared with vaccines and immunotherapy applications, LNP-mRNA nonimmunotherapy applications require a larger set of preclinical tests with a strong focus on safety. Based on the previously discussed mechanisms of immune activation by LNP-mRNAs, preclinical tests of such studies would optimally include: (1) correlation of increasing LNP-mRNA dose with cytokine and chemokine secretion, (2) complement activation, (3) repeated administration effects with examination of anti-drug antibodies, (4) acute liver toxicity markers and potential lipid accumulation, and (5) histopathology of the targeted organ. Unfortunately, the current literature on LNP-mRNA non-immunotherapy preclinical studies is mainly focused on drug efficacy in mouse models and offers limited safety data ( Table 1) . The listed preclinical studies covering recently published studies on RNA protein replacement show that this is still a relatively young field. Kormann et al. were the first to apply naked modified mRNAs encoding surfactant protein B (SP-B) and erythropoietin in the context of RNA protein replacement therapy in 2011 [80] . However, the first study using LNP-formulated mRNA for RPRT was published only in 2016 ( Table 1 ). In that study, Nabhan et al. applied LNP-mRNA encoding human frataxin as a potential therapeutic against Friedreich's ataxia [81] . The majority of the studies were published only recently, in the last 3-4 years ( Table 1 ). Although all of these studies show therapeutically relevant amounts of proteins of interest produced after the introduction of corresponding LNP-mRNA, less than a half of the 20 listed preclinical studies address safety issues. Traditionally, toxicological in vivo studies include examination of liver toxicity by measurement of clinical chemistry markers, e.g., alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), plus histopathology of immune and/or target organs. Depending on the route of drug application and specificities of the LNP, diverse organs can be targeted by LNP-mRNA therapeutics, with the liver as the most often targeted organ. Consistent with most of the studies listed in Table 1 , safety was traditionally examined through liver toxicity and histopathology studies. However, while traditional safety studies can detect strong impairments of the immune system, they would not deliver information regarding moderate and low immunotoxicity. Thus, additional studies addressing cytokine and chemokine secretion, ADAs, as well as complement activation are required to predict potential safety concerns such as immune activation or impairments. Cytokines and chemokines are biomarkers of immunotoxicity [101] . They have numerous functions in regulating immune responses and are a known cause of infusion reactions that can be characterized by fever, hypotension, vomiting, chills, headache, nausea, muscle pain, and so on [102, 103] . Cytokines, namely, interferon (IFN) gamma, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), typically lead to pro-inflammatory effects. IL-1 and IL-6 cause fever, and TNFα hypotension and IFNγ activate macrophages further boosting cytokine/chemokine secretion. Chemokines such as interferon-gamma induced protein 10 kD, CXCL10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1α), or MIP-1 Beta (MIP-1β), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) play a role in leukocyte recruitment and trafficking and may have a role in hyperinflammation when dysregulated, as reviewed in [103] . Interestingly, physiological levels of cytokine and chemokine in the serum of healthy volunteers depend on age and show individual differences [104] . While some cytokines/ chemokines such as IL-2 show relatively constant levels through the population, others such as IP-10 and MCP-1 can show 3-4-fold differences between individuals [104] . These basal physiological differences in the immune systems of healthy subjects may contribute to the diversity of responses to drug candidates. While the majority of patients would not develop infusion reactions, some may have mild to moderate adverse effects. In rare cases, life-threating conditions caused by large cytokine release called cytokine storm may occur [103] . For LNP-mRNA drug candidates, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends preclinical in vitro studies in human whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in vivo animal studies testing broad cytokine/chemokine panels including IL-2, IL-6, IFNγ, and TNFα, in order to map out the potential of exacerbated infusion related toxicities [105] . Interestingly, FDA also recommends that signs of cellular activation in vitro in human cells should be taken as a predictor of potential toxicities in the clinic regardless of negative findings from animal studies [105] . The reason for such a statement originates from 2006, when the therapy with monoclonal antibody TGN1412 passed safety preclinical tests including cynomolgous study, but ended up in a cytokine storm about 1 h after the drug application in all six subjects, resulting in multiple organ failures in two human subjects in the Phase 1 clinical study [106] . Later, it was found that lack of a specific human T cell receptor in all preclinical animal models led to such a misjudgment of drug safety. In vitro studies using human PBMCs added to the immobilized mAb or co-cultured with endothelial cells and then treated with mAb could help to predict the outcome through the detection of TNFα, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IFNγ cytokine release [106] . Table 2 provides an overview of the few studies that have examined cytokine/chemokine secretion in current RNA protein replacement preclinical studies literature. There are various aspects to be considered when evaluating preclinical cytokine and chemokine secretion data: (1) the animal model used and availability of in vitro human data; (2) applied dose and, for in vivo studies, the route of administration; (3) evaluation after single or repetitive dosing, including time of the evaluation; (4) cytokine/chemokine panel tested; and (5) assay used. In all listed studies, only in vivo mouse samples were tested, whereas human in vitro data were lacking. Additionally, only the results after at least the third dose of repetitive dosing were obtained, while the effects of the single dose were not examined. In the study of An et al., only data after the application of a low dose (0.2 mg/kg) and at a late (24 h) time was available, which showed no cytokine secretion [85] . Ramaswamy et al. and Prieve et al. tested cytokines at 3-7 h upon the application of a relatively high LNP-mRNA dose and found significant secretion of Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), MCP-1, MIP-1β, IL-6, RANTES, and IL-12 (Table 2) [83, 86] . In addition to the disease-related studies summarized here, only a limited number of other LNP-mRNA studies examined safety in more detail. Sedic et al. examined the safety of LNP-mRNA encoding for erythropoietin (EPO) in rats and non-human primates (NHPs) [107] . In rats, upon i.v. application of 0.3 mg/kg once or twice weekly, IP-10 was elevated 6 h and 24 h post-dose, while no change in IL-6, TNFα, and IFNα was observed. In monkeys, no change in tested cytokines/chemokines was detected when the same dose was applied. In the same study, elevation of C3a and C5b-9 with the magnitude increasing with repeated dosing was found in monkeys, whereas no complement activation could be observed in rats [107] . While testing novel amino lipid components of LNPs, Sabnis et al. also performed toxicology evaluation including liver toxicology, complement and MCP-1 serum concentration in cynomolgous monkeys infused with 1 mg/kg LNP-mRNA at 2 h, 6 h, and 25 h after day 1 and day 29 [108] . The authors found no indication for liver toxicity or complement activation, while a slight increase in MCP-1 at 2 h after the application on day 1 was observed. This effect became negligible at day 29. Unfortunately, the safety studies were shown only for the most effective novel amino lipid LNP5 while it stayed unclear how they compare for other tested lipids including the control MC3 lipid that was previously used in LNP-siRNA approved drug, Onpattro ® [53] . Magueri et al. analyzed mouse plasma cytokines: regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted (RANTES), keratinocytes-derived chemokine (KC), IL-6, IP-10, IL-1β, TNFα, MCP-1, and IFNγ, 5 h and 24 h after i.v. injection of 1.5 µg of LNP containing erythropoietin mRNA [109] . Interestingly, in this study, the authors found that cytokine concentrations were higher when LNP-mRNA was injected, compared with the injection of the same mRNA packed in extracellular vesicles (endo-EV-mRNAs) naturally formed upon the secretion of that endocytosed LNP-mRNA [109] . Recently, Noguiera et al. compared the safety profiles of LNPs with different stealth coating lipids: polyethylene glycol (PEG)lipid and polysarcosine (pSar) [59] . The authors tested IL-8, IL-6, IL1-β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-10, IL-4, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in human plasma from whole blood and found that LNPs formulated with pSar23 showed a reduced cytokine profile, compared with those prepared with 1,2-Dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene (PEG-DMG). In the same study, liver toxicology markers AST, ALT, laktat-dehydrogenase (LDH), and total Bilirubin were examined in mouse model upon weekly multiple injections during four weeks and 48 h post last injection, where comparable or advantageous safety profile was detected for pSar containing LNP [59] . Moreover, the authors incubated pSar23 and PEG LNPs with a human serum and found lower induction of C3a complement levels when a high dose of pSar23 was used compared with PEG LNP, indicating the lower toxicity of LNP formulated with pSar [59] . While these safety studies provide limited data on immune activation by applied LNP-mRNA drugs, there is a clear need for additional data that would address the following: the comparison of model systems and assays, as well as establishing optimal predictive panels, new biomarkers, and optimal testing time. Moreover, a better understanding of ranges and cut offs in cytokine/chemokine preclinical measurements and mapping out differences in between human donors would all together increase the predictive value of preclinical studies for clinics. Currently, there are only a few ongoing LNP-mRNA clinical studies for RNA protein replacement (Table 3) . From studies that were started between 2018-2020, two were discontinued: MRT5201 due to program discontinuation and mRNA-3704 due to a business decision. Phase 1 clinical trial of ARCT-810, the drug candidate for OTC deficiency, was successfully completed in healthy adults and is currently recruiting in a Phase 1/2 OTCD study. Similarly, the NCT03375047 study that examines the MRT5005 Cystic Fibrosis drug candidate is currently recruiting in Phase 1/2. Moreover, in addition to the clinical studies discussed here, companies such as Arcturus, Translate Bio, CureVac, BioNTech/Genevant, and Moderna have multiple LNP-mRNA-based RPRT/rare disease drug candidates in their pipelines (Table 4 ). With more LNP-mRNA drug candidates entering the clinic, examining the correlation between preclinical and clinical data would become possible. This would allow a better defining of preclinical regulatory guidelines. Finally, this would also allow a better understanding and use of the predictive value of preclinical models for further improving LNP-mRNA drug efficacy and safety, especially for non-immunogenic LNP-mRNA applications.  Innovation in mRNA and LNP components of LNP-mRNA drug candidates and improvements in the methods of their production are hallmarks of this relatively young therapeutic field. This constant development is the basis for the enormous therapeutic potential and expected growth in LNP-mRNA applicability not only for vaccines and immunotherapy, but also for more challenging applications such as RNA protein replacement and monoclonal antibody therapies. Innovation at the mRNA level includes (1) RNA nucleoside modification, (2) sequence and structure optimization, and (3) IVT mRNA production and purification methods (Figure 3 ). mRNA nucleoside modifications were a key finding that led to a boost in the efficacy and safety of mRNA. Karikó et al. discovered, in 2005 , that nucleoside-modified RNA is far less immunogenic, compared with unmodified mRNA [13] . The study showed that the incorporation of modified nucleosides 5-methylcytosine (m5C), 6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methyluridine (m5U), 2-thiouridine (s2U), or pseudouridine (Ψ), when compared with unmodified RNA, significantly reduced the secretion of cytokines by human dendritic cells (DCs). Increasing the content of the modified nucleosides per mRNA was directly proportional to the relative inhibition of TNFα expression in DCs. In 2008, Karikó et al. performed mouse in vivo studies and found that not only the safety, but also the translational capacity and mRNA stability were increased when RNA was modified [110] . Andries et al. tested translation and immunogenicity in vitro and in vivo in mice and found that 1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ)-incorporated mRNA outperforms Ψincorporated ones [111] . Due to its ability to significantly decrease probability for infusion reactions and to increase the efficacy, today, m1Ψ has become the most commonly used RNA modification for various LNP-mRNA applications: vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, or RNA protein replacement [9, 78, 83, 112, 113] . For example, BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine as well as the Moderna vaccine against COVID-19 utilize m1Ψ-modified mRNA [9, 114] . ines 2021, 9, (2) the active targeting of other tissues such as using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) recognizing specific molecules on T cells, lymphocytes, and brain or lung vasculature. (c) Moreover, to achieve increased efficacy and maximal safety, co-formulating molecules as corticosteroids (dexamethasone) or other small molecules known to inhibit innate immunity with LNP-mRNA candidate therapeutics may be performed. Optimization of the mRNA and LNP as components and combining LNP-mRNA with immune inhibitors aim to boost safety and efficacy of LNP-mRNA drug candidates.

The mRNA sequence and structure optimization include a panel of strategies known to improve pharmacology and the safety of LNP-mRNA therapeutics. Optimizing cap structure, 5 and 3 UTRs, coding sequence, and poly(A) tail length may significantly influence the performance of LNP-mRNA therapeutics (Figure 3 ). Efficiently linking 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap to the synthetic mRNA by 5'-5'triphosphate bridge and forming m7GpppN structure is necessary for efficient translation [115] . In the cytoplasm, the eIF4E translation initiation factor binds to the cap allowing the start of mRNA translation [116, 117] . Together with the poly(A) tail and RNA binding proteins, the cap is crucial for mRNA circularization, which ensures full-length translation and translation enhancement [118] . Additionally, in the cytoplasm, the cap binds mRNA decapping machinery, thus influencing mRNA degradation [119] . It was previously discussed that cap0, but not cap1, induces cytokines through RIG-I and MDA5 and that IFIT1 can bind to cap0 but with significantly lower affinity to cap1 or cap2 [41, [46] [47] [48] . Thus, it was expected that the presence of methylation on cap1 can also improve translation efficacy in certain cell types [120] . In the last 20 years, diverse synthetic cap structures were developed to enhance the efficiency and safety of IVT mRNA. Cap can be enzymatically added to the mRNA 5 end using vaccinia capping enzyme to form a cap0 following Vaccinia 2 O-methyltransferase application to finalize the cap1, as recently used in Modernas' COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273 [114] . Alternatively, the cap can be added during IVT reaction in a process called co-transcriptional capping, as in BioNTech/Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 [114, [121] [122] [123] [124] . Recently, diverse types of trinucleotide cap1 analogues allowing co-transcriptional capping are commercially available. CleanCap Cap1 AG trimer, and anti-reverse cap analogue (ARCA) CleanCap1 are widely used [120, 124, 125] . Another important structural feature of mRNAs, which can define their stability, localization, and expression are untranslated regions (UTRs) located on the 5 and 3 end of mRNAs (5 UTRs and 3 UTRs) [126, 127] . They exhibit cis-regulatory elements in their sequence recognized by microRNAs (miRNAs), long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), or RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) that impact translation and determine the fate of mRNA. Jain et al. introduced miRNA target sites to UTRs of therapeutic mRNAs to recruit endogenous miRNAs, thereby reducing the off-target expression of mRNA [128] . In their study, the introduction of multiple copies of hepatocyte specific miR-122 target sites to 3 UTRs of the mRNAs encoding apoptotic proteins prevented mRNA expression in healthy hepatocytes while allowing selective apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Exploiting posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA therapeutics by cellular lncRNAs and RBPs is still in its infancy and certainly will be an interesting field of innovation in the future. 5 UTR structures such as hairpins, pseudoknots, RNA G-quadruplexes, upstream open reading frames (uORF), and upstream start codons (uAUGs) that overall inhibit translation should be avoided when engineering optimal 5 UTRs for prolonged expression of LNP-mRNA therapeutics [127] . The most widely used 5 and 3 UTRs for therapeutic mRNAs are those from αand β-globin mRNAs that contain elements, which increase mRNA translation and stability [129, 130] . Multiple studies screened optimal UTRs for diverse applications. For example, Asrani et al. indicated 5 UTR as a key driver in protein expression and, in a screen of ten 5 UTRs, revealed that the complement factor 3 (C3) and cytochrome p4502E1 (CYP2E1) 5 UTRs demonstrated the largest and most consistent increase in protein expression relative to a reference UTR in vitro in human cells [131] . Sample et al. recently built a library of 280,000 randomized 50mer 5 UTRs that they combined with polysome profiling and deep learning. Subsequently, they used this to build a model and to engineer new 5 UTRs that can direct ribosome loading and provide optimal translation [132] . Motifs of 3 UTR were recently screened by Orlandini von Niessen et al., exploiting an unbiased in vitro method where motifs were correlated with mRNA stabilizing activity and activity in promoting high translation. This screen found that using the amino-terminal enhancer of split (AES)-mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA (mtRNR1)-based 3 UTR elements were beneficial over the previously used two head-to-tail-cloned human β-globin 3 UTRs (2hBg) in different systems including mice after i.v. vaccination with gp70-encoding mRNAs [133] . Those 3 UTR elements were recently exploited in the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine against COVID-19 [125] . Engineering the optimal coding sequence by replacing rare codons with frequently used synonymous codons, increasing G:C content, and avoiding certain regulatory sequences overall increase the mRNA protein expression (reviewed elsewhere [134] [135] [136] ). However, diverse codon optimizations must be tested empirically depending on the therapeutic mRNA application and specific targeted cell type. The Poly(A) tail, together with a cap, has an impact on translation and mRNA stability [137] . The poly(A) tail can be defined in a DNA plasmid template and transcribed during IVT reaction assuring uniform poly(A) tail length, or, mRNA can be extended after IVT by using recombinant poly(A)polymerase [138] . Both approaches of tailing have limitations: technical difficulties during cloning of plasmids coding long poly(A) tails or, in the case of enzymatic polyadenylation, assuring consistent poly(A) tail length and product uniformity during manufacturing. Today, most therapeutic mRNAs have poly(A) tail lengths of at least 50 nt to ≥100 nt. These lengths resemble the average lengths of most endogenous mRNAs according to various genome-wide poly(A) tail profiling methods, which revealed that the majority of mRNA tails are significantly shorter than the previously thought tail length of 250 adenosines [139] [140] [141] . The whole manufacturing process of IVT mRNA is a field of constant innovation and optimization with the aim to minimize the level of dsRNA and other contaminants and thus allowing the low immunogenicity of mRNA therapeutics. For example, Wu et al. used high temperature and thermostable T7 RNA polymerase to produce mRNA showing reduced immunogenicity without the need for purification [142] . However, various purification methods are widely utilized in order to reach maximal purity of single-stranded mRNA. For example, ion pair reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is still considered as a gold standard method for the depletion of unwanted byproducts/contaminants from mRNA of interest [143] . Unfortunately, HPLC is difficult to scale up for the manufacture of large amounts of mRNA and would lead to the production of high amounts of hazardous waste [17] . Therefore, cellulose chromatography was recently developed [17] . This method showed a great efficiency in the depletion of dsRNA contaminants and the production of mRNAs with high purity and low immune activation potential. In addition to optimizing mRNA and its manufacturing, optimization of LNP also has a great potential to significantly improve the safety and efficacy of LNP-mRNA-based therapeutics. Specific topics that may be differentiated in this field are (1) innovation in terms of ionizable lipids and biodegradable lipids for different application routes; (2) LNP-mRNA composition optimization; (3) innovations in stealth lipids; and (4) achievement of a specific cell/organ targeting through LNP-based changes (Figure 3b ). In this review, these topics are shortly summarized while they are reviewed in more depth elsewhere [4, 56] . Ionizable amino lipids are the major LNP component influencing the efficacy and tolerability of LNP-mRNA drugs. They function in cellular uptake, endosomal escape, and LNP ability to non-specifically bind serum proteins to the LNP surface. The first clinically approved amino lipid was MC3 (DLin-MC3-DMA) [53] . However, this lipid is known to have a long half-life in the organism, leading to mild-to-moderate adverse effects in clinical studies, thus being suboptimal for repetitive dosing applications [144, 145] . Therefore, novel ionizable and fully biodegradable lipids are constantly being developed. For example, Maier et al. used MC3 as a basis for developing a set of new biodegradable lipids of which L319 showed rapid clearance from plasma and tissues. In addition, L319 was well tolerated based on serum chemistry and histopathology when administered up to 10 mg/kg dose as a single bolus injection in a preclinical setting [144] . Sabnis et al. used a rational medicinal chemistry approach to optimize amino lipids and found a structure named LNP5 showing favorable pharmacokinetics, expression profile, endosomal escape efficiency, tissue clearance, and tolerability in mice and cynomolgous [108] . While both described studies focused on intravenous administration (i.v.), Hasset et al. focused on the optimization of LNP for intramuscular application (i.m.) and screened 30 novel ionizable biodegradable lipids [62] . The authors detected application route-dependent differences during the primary screen of immunogenicity and expression. Five novel propriety lipids that lead to the highest expression of LNP-mRNA in combination with low immunogenicity were applied i.m. in mice, rats, and NHP [62] . Optimization of LNP-mRNA composition includes varying lipid ratios or lipid-to-mRNA ratios. To optimize LNPs for mRNA delivery to liver, Kaufmann et al. developed a Design of Experiment (DOE) methodology [146] . By increasing ionizable lipid:mRNA weight ratios and incorporating 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) as a helper lipid, the authors significantly increased the efficiency of erythropoietin mRNA loaded LNP compared with the control LNP-mRNA based on LNP formulation used for LNP-siRNA delivery [146] . Sago et al. formulated multiple LNP libraries (in total > 250 LNPs) varying the amino lipid compound, molar amount, and the structure of PEG, as well as the molar amount of cholesterol [147] . Authors co-formulated Cre mRNA and DNA barcodes to each LNP and injected them i.v. or i.m. to Lox-Stop-Lox-tdTomato (Ai14) mice. They tested the delivery of LNP libraries in vivo based on the translation of Cre mRNA to Cre protein and isolation of fluorescent cells where targeted DNA was edited by Cre protein. This approach resulted in the identification of two novel LNPs that efficiently deliver mRNA to endothelial cells [147] . This study showed the importance of optimization of LNP composition not only for improvements in efficacy but also as a path for identifying LNPs with new tropisms. Stealth lipids such as PEG-lipid are necessary for increased half-life and stability of the LNP particle and influence its physicochemical properties. After LNP-mRNA administration to the blood, LNP adsorbs on its surface numerous proteins forming ""protein corona"" (reviewed in [63, 148] ). Among others, these proteins include albumin, immunoglobulins, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, coagulation factors, and complement proteins [149] . PEG-lipids-shielding lowers the interaction of LNP with complement and other proteins lowering the internalization of LNP-mRNAs by macrophages increasing circulation time of LNP-mRNA in the blood. In addition, PEG-lipids-shielding has impact against undesired aggregation and accumulation in filtering organs that might be caused by protein corona [148] . However, PEG-shielding may also lower the recognition of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), and it can cause the formation of anti-PEG ADAs that lead to lowering the efficiency of the LNP [60, 150] . Thus, the level of PEG-shielding must be optimized to obtain a compromise between efficacy and safety. With regard to anti-PEG ADAs formation, a recent study by Suzuki et al. examined PEG-containing LNP-siRNA in mice and found that LNPs with a fast-shedding PEG-lipid (short acyl chain) induced less anti-PEG IgM compared with those with long acyl chain LNPs [60] . The usage of the fast-shedding PEG-lipid allowed more hepatocyte targeting compared with Kupffer cells, the liver macrophages, thus improving the effectivity of LNP-siRNA drug [60] . This study is in agreement with the previous study by Judge et al. where the authors found less formed anti-PEG antibodies and a substantial reduction of side effects upon repetitive dosing in mice when PEGylated liposomes containing a shorter alkyl chain (C14) PEG-lipid versus a longer alkyl chain C16 PEG-lipid were used [151] . Studies directly examining the effects of anti-PEG antibodies on the efficacy and safety of LNP-mRNA drugs containing PEG lipids are still very limited. Recently, Nogueira et al. examined diverse chain lengths and molar fractions of stealth lipid Polysarcosine (PSar) and found efficient mRNA delivery with a lower cytokine pro-inflammatory profile, reduced complement activation, and liver toxicity markers, compared with PEG-containing LNPs [59] . Localization to particular tissues and the active targeting of LNP-mRNA therapeutics to specific cell types and organs are a topic of particular interest that can improve current off-target effects and pave a route for novel applications in difficult-to-target tissues. As already discussed, localization to particular tissues can be achieved by optimization on the mRNA level by introducing cell type specific miRNA target sites to 3 UTRs leading to the degradation of the mRNA, leading to the loss of translation efficacy of LNP-mRNA in selected cell types [128] . However, optimization on the level of LNP is the main focus with diverse approaches based on changing LNP structural components and optimizing LNP composition or those actively targeting specific cells using a functionalized surface, for example, with targeting ligands or antibodies. Most of the currently developed LNPs largely localize to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated uptake [152] . ApoE binds to LNP in circulation and facilitates binding to low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes, allowing the endocytosis of LNP-mRNA to the cell. Thus, most of the currently existing preclinical and clinical RNA protein replacement, as well as rare disease studies, consider liver diseases or utilize the liver as a protein production factory by using classical LNP formulations of smaller diameter (<100 nm) that are naturally accumulating in hepatocytes. That the size of the LNP particle >100 nm may be a limiting factor for hepatocyte targeting, especially in humans, could be inferred from Wisse at al., who measured the sizes of fenestrae [153] . Fenestrae are the pores in liver sinusoids with the size of 107 ± 1.5 nm in humans without liver pathology and with a significantly larger size in rodents: C57BL/6 mice (141 ± 5.4 nm) and Sprague-Dawley rats (161 ± 2.7 nm) [153] . To reach hepatocytes, LNP-mRNA must pass through the fenestrae, thus limiting the size of the LNP-mRNA to about 100 nm for hepatocyte targeting. The localization of LNP to other organs typically requires the optimization of LNP or active targeting. The importance of LNP composition optimization in screening carried out by Sago et al. resulted in finding 7C2 and 7C3 LNPs that efficiently target endothelial cells, as previously noted [147] . Using the same screening methodology as Sago et al., Gan et al. recently tested a library of 109 LNPs composed of ""constrained phospholipids"" that contained an adamantylhydrocarbon chain [154] . This study identified a novel LNP that delivers mRNA to Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes, without targeting ligands [154] . Recently, Zukancic et al. used Onpattro ® LNP, where the authors replaced 1, 2-Distearoylsn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-DSPE) with Tween 20 containing short (C11) PEG alkyl chain [155] . The authors found that the usage of the short PEG alkyl chain led to a significantly improved lymph node targeting after intramuscular administration in mice [155] . Few studies focused on actively targeting of lymphocytes. Ramishetti et al. functionalized the LNP surface by anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody to target CD4+ T cells [156] . Veiga et al. have used an ASSET (Anchored Secondary scFv Enabling Targeting), in which anti-Ly6c mAb is linked to LNPs in order to target Ly6c+ inflammatory leukocytes [157] . The authors tested this strategy applying anti-Ly6c mAb coated or isotype control LNP-formulated IL-10 mRNA in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis mice model of inflammatory bowel disease, where they showed the beneficial effects of the LNP-mRNA targeted vs. non-targeted approach. Recently, Ramishetti et al. synthesized a set of novel ionizable lipids, used them for mRNA formulation, screened LNP-mRNA expression and safety in leukocytes, and actively targeted primary lymphocytes using β7 integrin [158] . In order to actively target the inflamed brain tissue, Marcos-Contreras et al. tagged anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM) mAb to LNP-formulated thrombomodulin mRNA [159] . VCAM is highly expressed in cerebrovascular endothelium and VCAM-targeted LNP-thrombomodulin mRNAs accumulated in the TNFα injured brain mouse model and reduced brain edema caused by the TNFα injection [159] . Similarly, antivascular cell adhesion molecule, PECAM-1 mAb, was used for LNP-mRNA targeting lungs and, there, leading to a~200-fold enhanced delivery, when compared with untargeted tissues [160] . If upon optimization of both mRNA and LNP, components of LNP-mRNA undesired immunostimulatory features persist, one further possibility for their suppression and lowering of potential adverse effects is the incorporation of potent corticosteroids directly into the LNP-mRNA drug product (Figure 3c ). Chen et al. incorporated dexamethasone, a potent corticosteroid into the LNP containing various types of nucleic acids [161] . They used biodegradable linkers to chemically conjugate lipophilic acyl/alkyl moieties to dexamethasone and synthesized dexamethasone prodrugs which could be effectively incorporated into the LNPs. The usage of LNP-mRNA containing 10 mol% dexamethasone strongly ameliorated immune stimulation, leading to a significant decrease in IL-6, TNFα, IL12p70, IL-1β, IL-10 and keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC)/human growth-regulated oncogene (GRO) (KC/GRO) in plasma, 4 h after i.v. injection at a mRNA dose of 3 mg/kg in mice. Interestingly, the immunosuppressive effect of the incorporated dexamethasone was significantly higher compared with the free dexamethasone that was co-administered with LNP-mRNA therapeutic [161] . Other strategies to prevent potential unwanted immunostimulation by LNP-mRNAs are the use of other small molecules or siRNAs against key innate immunity response mediators (as reviewed recently by [2, 162] ). However, the effectivity of such innate immune inhibitors was established only in rare specific cases, indicating the potential challenges for wider applicability and the necessity of further studies.@story_separate@In the past years, we have witnessed an accelerated growth of RNA-based technologies and their applications. The first LNP-siRNA drug, Onpattro ® , for the treatment of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, was approved in 2018. Recently, two LNP-mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained emergency or conditional marketing authorizations from multiple regulatory agencies worldwide. However, while clinical studies of other prophylactic vaccines are still scarce (e.g., Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Zika, and Rabies), the numerous cancer vaccines and immuno-oncology actively recruiting clinical studies are in Phase 1 or Phase 2. Key leaders in the field of LNP-mRNA technology development such as BioNTech, Moderna, and CureVac have focused on cancer immunotherapy applications in the following indications: melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck cancer, triple negative breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic and ovarian cancer, and multiple solid tumors. There are significant similarities in the different mRNA therapeutic fields in terms of LNP and mRNA development and manufacturing. The similarities encompass all the basic commonalities in the sequence and structure of mRNA that should resemble endogenous mRNA and features of LNP that should allow the most efficient transfer to the cells of interest. However, there are also some differences between immunotherapy (vaccines and cancer immunotherapies) and non-immunotherapy (RNA protein replacement and some of monoclonal antibodies therapeutics) applications. In most immunotherapy applications (infectious disease and cancer vaccines), a boost of the immune system based on natural recognition of synthetic mRNAs and LNP components mimicking viral attack may be beneficial [1, 163] . For example, single-stranded antigen coding RNA oligonucleotides were found to induce T helper cells 1 (Th1)-type cytokines and to simultaneously activate an innate immune response in addition to an adaptive immune antigen specific response [15] . Conversely, in non-immunotherapy applications, fine-tuning of the LNP-mRNA components to fully diminish immune activation and increase safety is crucial. Thus, understanding the basic pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of LNP-mRNA non-immunotherapy drug candidates and their interaction with the host immune system is necessary. Therefore, numerous preclinical studies underwent prolonged optimization to ensure a strong focus on safety before entering the clinic. Over multiple years, both immunotherapy and non-immunotherapy mRNA therapeutic fields underwent a great deal of innovation and significant growth. Self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA) encode replicase and protein of interest and replicate in cells utilizing viral replication strategy (comprehensively reviewed elsewhere [164, 165] ). saRNA generate dsRNA intermediate during their cellular amplification, are potent activators of the immune system, and are one of the innovative tools in immunotherapy. The mRNA modification and other numerous improvements in the domain of conventional mRNA and LNP structure, as well as their manufacturing, were and are continuously being carried out. However, since this is a relatively young field, efforts to better clarify the necessity for collecting not only traditional toxicology and histopathology data, but also extended safety data such as on cytokines/chemokines, complement, and anti-drug antibodies are necessary. These markers are found to be more sensitive and can serve as better predictors of potential adverse effects. To better predict clinical outcomes, similar to their use in the field of small molecule drugs, systems biology and modeling should also be increasingly exploited in LNP-mRNAs preclinical studies. Moreover, a commitment to better understand the predictive value of non-clinical study models and the differences between model systems is needed. Furthermore, developing primary human cells, tissues, and organ cultures as models for measurements of LNP-mRNA therapeutics efficiency and safety would be beneficial. As summarized, only a few Phase 1 clinical studies are currently ongoing in the RNA protein replacement/rare disease field. Further efforts in optimizing LNP-mRNAs, examining the potential for combination with small molecule drugs or other medical treatments, and improving preclinical and regulatory guidelines will certainly lead to more high-quality preclinical and clinical LNP-mRNA non-immunotherapy studies. Particularly, a large impact is to be expected for the delivery of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (such as the currently ongoing mRNA-1944 clinical study against Chikungunya virus, NCT03829384) and in the rare disease field where high unmet medical needs are present among many indications.","Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated messenger RNA-based (LNP-mRNA) vaccines came into the spotlight as the first vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 virus to be applied worldwide. Long-known benefits of mRNA-based technologies consisting of relatively simple and fast engineering of mRNA encoding for antigens and proteins of interest, no genomic integration, and fast and efficient manufacturing process compared with other biologics have been verified, thus establishing a basis for a broad range of applications. The intrinsic immunogenicity of LNP formulated in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA is beneficial to the LNP-mRNA vaccines. However, avoiding immune activation is critical for therapeutic applications of LNP-mRNA for protein replacement where targeted mRNA expression and repetitive administration of high doses for a lifetime are required. This review summarizes our current understanding of immune activation induced by mRNA, IVT byproducts, and LNP. It gives a comprehensive overview of the present status of preclinical and clinical studies in which LNP-mRNA is used for protein replacement and treatment of rare diseases with an emphasis on safety. Moreover, the review outlines innovations and strategies to advance pharmacology and safety of LNP-mRNA for non-immunotherapy applications."
"During the 21st century, antimicrobial resistance has become the biggest threat to public healthcare worldwide. 1 Infections caused by resistant bacteria have led to increased mortality and morbidity rate, hospital stay, and costs on healthcare facilities. 2, 3 In 2013 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that about 2 million people had been seriously infected with resistant bacteria in the United States, and about 23,000 individuals had died directly because of infections caused by resistant bacteria. 1 Antibiotic resistance occurs when the antibiotic loses its ability to inhibit bacterial growth.I In this setting, bacteria are able to continue multiplying and cause further damage, despite therapeutic levels of antibiotics. 4 Recently, researchers have found that there is a strong relationship between the irrational use of antimicrobial drugs and the emergence of bacterial resistance, 5,6 especially in developing countries, due to the ease in antimicrobial accessibility and their frequent use. 7 Thus, improving antimicrobial prescribing patterns has become an important issue for many healthcare sectors. 8 One of the critical interventions that can effectively control antimicrobial use and decrease antimicrobial resistance is the implementation of Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS). Antimicrobial Stewardship as a term indicates that antimicrobial agents must be used wisely and responsibly, which includes developing actions that create a balance between appropriate patient therapy and sustained society access. 9, 10 Stewardship programs are divided into two sets of interventions, the first set is related to patient care and recommendation, such as following the guidelines for the management of infectious diseases. The second set is related to strategies that restrict over-the-counter use of antimicrobial agents and improve healthcare providers' knowledge of and perception towards antimicrobial use. 10 In Jordan, community pharmacists are among the most accessible healthcare providers within the healthcare system with the ability to dispense antibiotics. 11 Unfortunately, they are one of the most significant contributors to antimicrobial resistance, through dispensing antibiotics over-the-counter, which is illegal in many other countries. 11 Therefore, it is essential to educate community pharmacists about AMS to combat the increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance. 12, 13 Educational programs can be put in place via conferences, workshops, and regular lectures/webinars for the healthcare sectors. 14 The literature is till now limited with respect to interventional studies to improve community pharmacists' knowledge and perception towards AMS in Jordan. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of an online educational workshop on improving the knowledge, and perception of community pharmacists towards the AMS and in enhancing their ability to appropriately select correct antibiotic therapy.@story_separate@This is a pre-post study conducted in December 2020 to evaluate the impact of implementing an educational workshop on enhancing community pharmacists' awareness and perception about AMS and in improving their ability to appropriately select correct antibiotic therapy. Pharmacists engaged in the study met the following requirements: 1) registered licensed pharmacists, 2) currently working in community pharmacies, and 3) willing to participate in the study. The study questionnaire was developed following a comprehensive literature review, [15] [16] [17] and consisted of several multiple choice questions. Experts in the field (three PhD holders in clinical pharmacy) had reviewed the questionnaire for structure and content validity to assess the clarity, understandability, and organization of the constructed questionnaire. They were asked to provide their feedback, and the amendment was done accordingly. Also, the final draft of the survey was pilot tested on a group of pharmacists to assure the clarity and comprehensibility of the questions, and the response from these pharmacists were excluded from the final analysis. It was estimated that filling-out the survey would take approximately 10 minutes before and 10 minutes after the workshop. A Cronbach's alpha test was used to test its internal reliability, which yielded a 0.878, thus the current scale has reliable and has an acceptable internal consistency. The questionnaire was designed in English language and it was divided into four sections. The first section was dedicated to respondents' socio-demographic characteristics, which involve information about pharmacist's gender, age, educational level, experience, and the type of pharmacy where they worked. The second section was about evaluating community pharmacy knowledge about antimicrobial resistance and AMS. The third section evaluated pharmacists' perception towards AMS, the responses on this section were on a 5-points Likert scale (5: strongly agree, 4: agree, 3: neutral, 2: disagree, and 1: strongly disagree). Finally, the last section assessed pharmacists' ability to appropriately select correct antibiotic therapy for four community pharmacy virtual cases. For knowledge questions, participants gained one point for each correct answer and zero point for each incorrect answer. Then, the total knowledge score ranged from 0 to https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S324865 Infection and Drug Resistance 2021:14 10 . A similar scoring were applied for the evaluation for the virtual cases, where participants gained one point for each correct selection of antimicrobial, and zero point for each incorrect selection. Community pharmacists working in different areas in Jordan were invited to attend a two-day educational workshop using an advertisement posted on social media platforms (Facebook groups for pharmacists). Pharmacists who agreed to take part in the study were directed to a closed group created for the purpose of this study on a social media platform (WhatsApp) to further arrange for their participation. Prior to the beginning of the first workshop session, pharmacists were requested to fill the pre-workshop online questionnaire, which was distributed to them through the closed group; they were allowed 20 minutes to complete the form, after that the link get deactivated. The same questionnaire was provided to the same cohort of subjects following the second workshop session to assess the impact of the education workshop on improving their knowledge, perception about AMS and enhancing their ability to appropriately select correct antibiotic therapy. The educational workshop was conducted over two sessions on two consecutive days, Friday the 25th of Dec-2020 and Saturday the 26th of Dec-2020. The sessions were conducted using the Zoom virtual platform. Each session was an hour and a half long, through which PowerPoint presentations, videos, and clinical case scenarios were given. The workshop material was guided by the World Health Organization (WHO) antimicrobial stewardship online course modules. 18 The material was prepared by the authors, assessed and presented by two clinical pharmacists experts in the field with more than ten years of experience in the field of infectious diseases. Four lectures were prepared to cover the theoretical aspects related to 1) the basic concept of antibiotics, and principles of therapy, 2) antimicrobial resistance, 3) AMS, and 4) pharmacists' role in stewardship programs. A booklet containing some of the infection guidelines such as respiratory infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections was provided to the pharmacists through the closed group and was discussed through the first session of the workshop. The closed WhatsApp group was also used to share information about different smartphone applications that would help the pharmacist in their daily practice. The study protocol was submitted to obtain approval by the Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Pharmacy at Applied Science Private University (Approval No. 2020-PHA-20). The study was conducted following the ethical standards outlined in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki guideline. 19 Pharmacists were requested to approve an electronic informed consent, and they were informed that their participation in the study is voluntary, and they had the right to defer from submitting their filled forms at any time. Also, they were assured that their responses would be kept confidential and anonymous. Data was analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The descriptive analysis was done using mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and percentages for qualitative variables. Checking for normality was carried out using the Shapiro-Wilk test (with P-value > 0.05 indicating a normally distributed continuous variable). Wilcoxon sign rank test was used to evaluate prepost changes in continuous variables, while McNemar's test was used to evaluate differences in categorical variables between pre-workshop and post-workshop data. Cronbach's α was used to evaluate the reliability of the questionnaire, with values ≥ 0.7 indicates acceptable internal consistency (19) . For all statistical analyses, a P-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and all tests were two-tailed. Overall, 269 community pharmacists participated in the first workshop session; among them, only 100 completed the second session and filled out the questionnaire post the workshop (completion rate of 37.8%). The mean age of the study participants was 30.9 years (SD= 8. Table 1 . Pharmacists were asked about their main source of knowledge about antibiotics and antibiotic use (Figure 1 ). Results showed that clinical textbooks (n= 88, 88.0%), clinical guidelines (n= 87, 87.0%), and university lectures (n= 86, 86.0%) were the most used sources by the pharmacists. Pharmacists stated that their source was practice, such as personal clinical experience (n= 82, 82.0%) and other pharmacist colleagues (n= 78, 78.0%). At the same time, half of the participants used websites or social media as a source of information, such as PubMed (n= 59. 59.0%), Wikipedia (the medical encyclopedia) (n= 58, 58.0%), and social media (n= 49, 49.0%). All the participating pharmacists responded to 10 statements regarding antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial stewardship programs before and after the workshop, and the results are presented in Table 2 . Following an education workshop, some improvement of pharmacists' knowledge was noted. In comparison to 59.0% of the respondent (n=59) knew that the statement ""broadspectrum antibiotic should always be used in place of narrow-spectrum to reduce microbial resistance"" is an incorrect statement, this percentage was improved significantly to 81.0% (n= 81) after the workshop (P-value <0.001). Moreover, 60.0% of the respondent (n= 60) believed that the efficacy of the more expensive antibiotic is not associated with better effectiveness and lower resistance, compared to 92.0% (n= 92) following the workshop (P-value <0.001). In addition, participants' knowledge regarding antimicrobial stewardship was improved, where 32.0% of the respondents (n= 32) realize that the stewardship program would not increase the treatment duration to ensure therapeutic efficacy compared with a significantly higher percentage following the workshop (n= 56, 56.0%) (P-value <0.001). Finally, pharmacists showed an enhancement in their awareness that antimicrobial stewardship is a process that involves the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy, where the percentage improved from 76.0% (n= 76) pre the workshop to 89.0% (n= 89) following the workshop (P-value = 0.019). For the overall knowledge score (out of 10), the overall median knowledge score was improved from 6 (IQR= 4) pre the workshop to a median of 7 (IQR= 2) post the workshop (P-value <0.001). For more details, refer to Table 2 . All participants were asked to determine the preferred empiric treatment for four virtual community pharmacy cases ( Figure 2 ). Regarding the urinary tract infection (UTI), pharmacists showed a significant improvement in their ability to appropriately select correct antibiotic therapy Nitrofurantoin (from 63.0% (n= 63) pre-workshop to 72.0% (n= 72) post the workshop (P-value = 0.049)). A similar finding was found for viral conjunctivitis, where only 56% of the pharmacists (n= 56) recognized that the patient does not need to start an antimicrobial agent. This percentage was significantly improved to 65.0% (n= 65) following the workshop (P-value = 0.049). Regarding the other two cases (tooth infection and cellulitis infection), no significant improvements were detected in pharmacists' responses following workshop attendance (P-values >0.05 for both).  All participants responded to eight statements with the aim of evaluating their satisfaction with the training workshop. They all agreed that the workshop helped them learn (n= 97, 97.0%) and understand the antimicrobial resistance (n= 95, 95.0%); participants also reported that the workshop improved their understanding of the concept of antimicrobial stewardship (n= 94, 94.0%). Most respondents strongly agreed/agreed that the educational workshop helped them understand the importance of stewardship programs (n= 96, 96.0%) and will be reflected in their daily practice (n= 93, 93.0%). For more details, refer to Table 4 . The mortality and morbidity rates for infectious and communicable diseases increase proportionally in many countries. 15 The level of antimicrobial resistance increased due to overprescribing, unlimited accessibility, and frequent antimicrobials prescriptions. 20 Thus, several studies were conducted to better educate healthcare providers about AMS and increase their awareness about their responsibilities to follow the guidelines for antimicrobial stewardship in practice. [21] [22] [23] Out of 269 community pharmacists, 100 attended the two sessions of the workshop (completion rate of 37.8%). The reason for decreasing in attendance number can be explained by the country situation at that time; the first day of the workshop took place during the lockdown of the whole sectors because of COVID-19, while the second day of the workshop was held on a working day for pharmacists. This study was conducted to assess the impact of conducting educational training on improving the awareness, knowledge, and perception of Jordanian community pharmacists towards antimicrobial stewardship. Up to our knowledge, this study was the first study that evaluates these aspects regarding community pharmacists in Jordan. This study showed a significant positive improvement in the community pharmacist's knowledge and perception. It revealed some improvement in their ability to appropriately select correct antibiotic therapy for virtual community pharmacy cases following the educational intervention (P-value <0.05), indicating that this educational workshop was useful and efficient to teach about AMS. Numerous previous studies elucidated the improvement in healthcare provider's knowledge after conducting educational intervention. 17, [24] [25] [26] [27] This study showed that only one-third of community pharmacists were familiar with the definition of AMS before the educational intervention, indicating the poor awareness of pharmacists with AMS. Similar findings were reported in studies conducted in Egypt, 17 and Ethiopia, 28 which showed that less than half of the healthcare professionals were familiar with the term AMS. However, other studies reported higher awareness rates,  such as studies conducted in South Africa (71.9%), 29 and Australia (80%). 30 This inadequate awareness of community pharmacists about AMS could be explained by the lack of educational intervention and promotion of AMS programs across Jordan. Also, this study showed a good knowledge of community pharmacists regarding antimicrobial resistance. This result came in line with other studies about healthcare provider's familiarity with antimicrobial resistance in Egypt and Ethiopia. 17, 28 Community pharmacists showed a positive perception regarding AMS before and after the educational intervention. This result aligned with another study that reported that about half of the participants knew the role and effectiveness of AMS before the educational intervention. 29 In contrast to what was found in another study, which revealed that more than half of the respondents did not know about the role of AMS before conducting the educational program. 17 Community pharmacist's ability to appropriately select correct antibiotic has been assessed by evaluating pharmacists' abilities in dealing with virtual community pharmacy cases. Results showed an improvement in pharmacists' abilities in selecting the most appropriate antimicrobial as compared to prior to the workshop. This was also reported by another study where they showed that the poor practice of respondent pre-educational intervention, and they justified this result due to the absence of clinical education and skill expertise. However, they reported improving respondent practice after the educational intervention. 17, 31 Other studies supported these findings that showed a positive correlation between knowledge and practice. [32] [33] [34] The training module's impact was reflected in a good way on pharmacists, as shown through their satisfaction outcomes. The majority of pharmacists (93-97%) were more than satisfied with the training workshop; their satisfaction was detected in all aspects. It could be assumed that using real medical scenarios for a healthcare provider during the training sessions would make it more comprehensible and simple to be closer to professionalism. 35 Although, this study is the first of its kind in Jordan, which gives it a great strength point, but it has several limitations. The main limitation of this study is that the training intervention's influence was studied immediately after conducting the workshop. This may not reflect the actual effect of the training module on real practice long term. Thus, further studies are necessitated to evaluate the impact of conducting educational measures on pharmacists' skills in implementing antimicrobial stewardship in the long term. In addition, pharmacists were invited to participate through social media which introduced selection bias; as some proportion of the community pharmacist do not have active social media profiles. This may limit the generalizability of results to the general population. All authors made a significant contribution to the work reported, whether that is in the conception, study design, execution, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation, or in all these areas; took part in drafting, revising or critically reviewing the article; gave final approval of the version to be published; have agreed on the journal to which the article has been submitted; and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work.@story_separate@This educational workshop effectively improved community pharmacists' knowledge about AMS and their abilities in selecting the most appropriate antimicrobial. Thus, efforts should to be intensified to increase perception, awareness, and skills in implementing AMS. These efforts should be focused at different levels, ranging from implementing educational modules in universities and presenting convenient training and educational programs for community pharmacy staff, at regular intervals.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of an online educational workshop on improving the knowledge, and perception of community pharmacists in Jordan towards the antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and enhancing their ability to appropriately select correct antibiotic therapy. METHODS: This is a pre-post study that was conducted in Jordan in December 2020. An electronic questionnaire was used to assess the awareness, perception of community pharmacists towards AMS, and their ability to appropriately select correct antibiotic before and after the educational workshop. The two-days’ workshop was conducted on Zoom application. Analysis was conducted using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, McNemar’s test using SPSS version 22. RESULTS: During the study period, 100 community pharmacists attended the educational workshop. Pharmacists’ knowledge was assessed prior to their participation which revealed a relatively good knowledge score with a median score of 6/10 (IQR = 4); their scores have improved significantly following the educational workshop with a median score of 7/10 (IOR = 2), p-value<0.001. Although one-third of the participants knew the definition of AMS prior to the workshop, almost half of the respondents (n = 56, 56%) knew the definition after the educational workshop. Regarding community pharmacist’s ability to appropriately select correct antibiotic therapy, they showed a significant improvement in selecting the optimal antimicrobial for the virtual cases following the workshop (p-value < 0.05). Perceptions towards AMS were consistently positive before and after the workshop. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the benefit of AMS-focused workshops for improving community pharmacists’ knowledge and appropriate antibiotic prescribing. Thus, efforts are required to implement more AMS educational workshops for community pharmacists."
"Antimicrobials are essential to protecting human health. Their effectiveness is under threat due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), resulting from misuse of antimicrobials over several decades. At the 2015 United Nations General Assembly, member states committed to address AMR by adopting national plans centred on five strategic objectives outlined in the WHO's Global Action Plan. 1 2 The fourth objective of this plan is to implement national and hospital treatment guidelines for the optimisation of antimicrobial medicines use. 2 Guidelines are among AMR stewardship interventions intended to modify clinician behaviour by providing guidance on when, and how, to prescribe antimicrobials, integrating information on antimicrobial consumption, resistance surveillance, research and development and burden of resistance. [3] [4] [5] Preservation of antimicrobials requires the consideration of how, and under what@story_separate@► This is the first study to assess whether guidelines are considering local dimensions such as antimicrobial resistance. ► We employed systematic methods and used established frameworks to assess the credibility of guidelines. ► By focusing on three key Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II domains and a relatively low score we were is inclusive but we included only English language publications. ► The use of the credibility cut-off score of 60% or greater for three of the six AGREE II domains is based on limited guidance on cut-off thresholds. ► We used criteria of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Evidence to Decision Frameworks that are fairly general as they apply to any interventions and may need to be complemented with specific criteria related to the antimicrobial field. Open access conditions, is it appropriate to recommend antimicrobials. However, only a small number of recently published guidelines considered epidemiological and resistance pattern data. 6 There are also concerns that guidelines are not considering important contextual factors, including evidence on values, resource use, equity, acceptability and feasibility that go beyond resistance patterns and that may influence secular trends in AMR. 7 8 For example, guideline recommendations are likely to better support effective use of antimicrobials in specific contexts when they account for how much people value the affected health outcomes ('values'), AMR burden, public health infrastructure, local medicine policies for consistent access to safe, effective, affordable medicines and equitability of antimicrobial regimens. 9 Considering these factors is also relevant for adapting and implementing. The failure to account for these factors likely results from the lack of formal guidance for developing recommendations that consider AMR and other local factors. Incomplete reporting of evidence supporting recommendations, and the existing belief that guideline developers must develop their recommendations 'from scratch', results in additional challenges. Scientific societies and other organisations duplicate the same work to develop recommendations resulting in multiple guidelines on the same topic, confusion and loss of confidence by clinicians, and resource waste. 8 10 However, guideline processes can become more effective, if they can be effectively adapted by others. This process requires transparent reporting of how the guideline development groups moved from evidence to recommendations, and properly include AMR. Formal processes for adaptation permit societies and organisations to capitalise on existing evidence evaluation and interpretation by considering important contextual factors, among which AMR is the most noticeable. This would reduce cost and redundancy. 7 Our objectives were to analyse how, and to what extent, tuberculosis (TB), gonorrhoea and respiratory tract infection guidelines are considering AMR; are of acceptable methodological quality; and if they can be easily contextualised to fit the needs of specific populations. We selected three types of infection: TB, gonorrhoea and respiratory tract infections, specifically otitis media, pharyngitis, sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia. These infections are a public health priority because they are becoming increasingly harder to treat due to AMR and/or are treated inappropriately, leading to higher risk of toxicity or resistance development. Harder to treat drug-resistant TB strains are increasing and projected to account for a quarter of all TB deaths by 2050. 11 Neisseria gonorrhoea is an urgent public health threat. 12 The international spread of resistance to the last effective therapy, ceftriaxone and azithromycin, threatens sustained treatment of gonorrhoea. 13 14 Otitis media, pharyngitis, sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia are prevalent and Streptococcus pneumoniae (the main causal microorganism), was classified as a serious public health threat due to resistance observed by inappropriate use of antibiotics. 12 15 All these syndromes have been prioritised by WHO as part of Access, Watch and Reserve (AWaRe)-a new classification system that supports a more nuanced approach to target inappropriate use of broad spectrum 'Watch' antibiotics. 16 We included English language guidelines published between 2007 and 2019 on the above selected infections. We restricted to English language guidelines because, from a practical standpoint, English language publications would be the simplest to contextualise for most international groups and the major international organisations like WHO publish their guidelines at least in English. We marked the 2007 WHO decision to update its guideline development and using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach as a major change in methodology, representing a division of two eras. 17 We limited the focus of our analyses to the era following this change. We included guidelines with clearly articulated recommendations as defined by the Institute of Medicine Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical Practice Guidelines. 14 After contacting guideline developers, we excluded guidelines with unobtainable online supplemental materials required for analysis (see online supplemental table 1S) for our guideline and recommendation selection outlined in PICAR format). We searched Ovid MEDLINE and Embase from inception to 7 June 2019 (detailed search strategies in online supplemental material). We conducted a second search in four guideline databases: Turning Research Into Practice (https://www. tripdatabase. com), Guidelines International Network (https://www. g-i-n. net/ home), BIGG (http:// sites. bvsalud. org/ bigg/ en/ biblio/) and the Canadian Medical Association clinical practice guideline (CPG) Infobase (https:// joulecma. ca/ cpg/ homepage). We finally searched key international websites (online supplemental table 2S) and reviewed references of included guidelines. Independently and in pairs, reviewers (RSM, AB, AD, MV, GPM, SK and TB) screened titles and abstracts and the full text of potentially eligible guidelines. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or with a third reviewer (NS and HS). We extracted data from guidelines, retrievable online supplemental materials and guideline development documents facilitated by pilot-tested forms and distill-erSR (https://www. evidencepartners. com). Extractors (RSM, AB, AD, FS, GPM, MV and SK) recorded data independently and in pairs, and resolved disagreements. Reviewers screened through recommendations classifying them as either considering AMR or not according to in table 1 and online  supplemental table 3S) . Although guidelines may have adopted different approaches to considering resistance with varying level of technicalities and detail, our operational definitions for considering a guideline 'compliant' were inclusive. We assumed that for each recommendation, there would be an opportunity to consider information pertaining to AMR at the population and outcome level, given that formulation of specific recommendations is guided by population, intervention, comparison and outcome (PICO) frameworks. Population-level considerations include recommendations for populations with some level of resistance, considerations of local resistance patterns, recommending the use of narrow-spectrum antimicrobials and recommending the watchful-waiting approach to prescribing. Outcome-level dimensions included considering prospects of AMR or the emergence of resistance as a consequence of antimicrobial use. We considered a guideline satisfactory if it reports information on any of the above dimensions in either the recommendation, accompanying evidence summaries or PICO framework. Whereas guidelines that generally discussed AMR as an issue, without linking information pertaining to AMR to each recommendation were considered unsatisfactory. We assessed a guideline's quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II Instrument focusing on three relevant domains: a welldefined scope and purpose (domain one), rigorous development including a systematic search for evidence, transparent reporting of methods, links between evidence and recommendations, external review and procedures for update (domain three), and editorial independence (domain six). 18 We defined acceptable quality as guidelines that scored 60% or greater in these three domains a priori based on limited guidance on cut-off thresholds. 3 19 Focusing on these three domains and selecting a relatively low score, allowed us to be inclusive. We also abstracted information on values, resource use, equity, acceptability and feasibility from guidelines that met our acceptability cut-off (ie, 60%). Briefly, worldwide regions may differ in the accessibility of antimicrobials, the cultural view towards the use of antimicrobials, pharmaceutical costs and healthcare structures. We selected these dimensions as the transparent reporting of these factors is essential: in appraising the evidence for antimicrobials, Amoxicillin-clavulanate rather than amoxicillin alone is recommended as empiric antimicrobial therapy for Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in adults (weak, low). 13 Local national surveillance data in the United States of America for amoxicillin and betalactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae was narratively described in the evidence summary was clearly linked to the recommendation. AMR outcomelevel dimensions considered In neonates with gonococcal conjunctivitis, the WHO sexually transmitted infections (STIs) guideline suggests one of the following treatment options: ► Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg (maximum 150 mg) intramuscular (IM) as a single dose. ► Kanamycin 25 mg/kg (maximum 75 mg) IM as a single dose. ► Spectinomycin 25 mg/kg (maximum 75 mg) IM as a single dose. 89 The outcome of 'AMR' was formally considered within a PICO framework within the guideline's online supplemental file 1. Bedaquiline should be included in longer multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB regimens for patients aged 18 years or more (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the estimates of effect). 90 The recommendation considers a multidrugresistant TB patients, and the outcome 'acquisition (amplification) of drug resistance' 91 was formally considered within a PICO framework provided within the guideline's supplemental materials. Alternative first choice of antibiotics for adults aged 18 years and over with pharyngitis and a penicillin allergy or intolerance: Clarithromycin 250 mg to 500 mg wo times per day a day for 5 days days. 55 Summary of committee discussions show that population-level resistance data was considered: 'based on evidence, clinical experience and resistance data, the committee agreed to recommend the following alternative firstchoice antibiotics for use in penicillin allergy or for phenoxymethylpenicillin intolerance: clarithromycin or erythromycin (which is preferred in pregnancy)'. 55 Additional formal outcome considerations include 'antibiotic resistance' within the guideline's supplemental materials. PICO, population, intervention, comparison, and outcome; TB, tuberculosis. Open access guideline developers should be aware of the breadth of implications of their recommendations when used by decision-makers. 7 10 20 21 Guidelines that ignore this wider agenda could provide narrow, misleading guidance. We conducted descriptive statistics at the guideline and recommendation level, using counts and proportions (95% CI). We calculated the mean (SD) for AGREE II scores by region. We also compared the quality of guidelines from the WHO versus regional guidelines using scaled domain scores, mean difference, and a two-sided t-test. We calculated the frequency of guideline reporting of values, resource use, equity, acceptability and feasibility. All analyses were conducted in Microsoft Excel and R-Studio (RStudio Team (2016). RStudio: Integrated Development for R. RStudio, Boston, Massachusetts, USA, URL http://wwwrstudiocom/.). This paper is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metaanalyses guidelines and internally funded by the Michael G. DeGroote Cochrane Canada and McMaster GRADE centres. One of the authors is a patient with a rare disease affected by repeated infections and treatment related issues of resistance to antimicrobials and was involved in aspects of the design and data abstraction. We specifically looked for information about patient values and preferences and included this in our review. However, we did not make any additional specific efforts to involve the patient and public in other aspects of this systematic review. Our initial search identified 10 365 records. After screening, we retrieved 79 guidelines that had at least one recommendation on antimicrobial selection: (n=28 TB, n=13 gonorrhoea, n=38 respiratory tract infections). Of these, 78 guidelines had sufficient information for assessment-one gonorrhoea guideline was excluded because we were unable to retrieve supplemental materials (figure 1 and online supplemental table 4S). 22 Guideline recommendations considering AMR After classifying recommendations, we found that 74 guidelines had at least one recommendation that considered AMR and four guidelines without such considerations (table 2) . [23] [24] [25] [26] These were excluded from further assessment. Of the 74 guidelines, the majority were developed in North America (n=29), 13 22 27-54 and Europe (n=26). 44 55-78 A smaller portion were from Asia (n=7), [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] South America (n=1), 86 Africa (n=1) 87 and Oceania (n=1). 88 Nine guidelines were internationally developed by the WHO. [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] Within these 74 guidelines, we found that approximately two-thirds of recommendations (n=808/1198) considered AMR; that figure was 55.2% for TB recommendations (n=272), 84.7% for gonorrhoea recommendations (n=150) and 73.1% for respiratory tract infection recommendations (n=386). The majority of recommendations were regionally developed (n=736) (figure 2). Most recommendations considered either populationlevel or outcome-level AMR dimensions, while fewer considered both simultaneously. Approximately 17.6% of recommendations (n=142/808) considered AMR at the population-level only while 34.7% (n=281/808) of recommendations considered resistance as an outcome only. Most notably, a majority of those considering AMR as an outcome were not explicitly stated in PICO format, but rather buried within evidence summaries. Clearly Open access stated outcomes formally considered in PICO frameworks included: 'acquired drug-resistance', 'antimicrobial in vitro resistance', 'bacterial antibiotic resistance', and 'emergence of drug-resistance'. Among respiratory tract infection recommendations, 6.9% (n=27/386) recommended no antimicrobial or back-up antimicrobial (ie, the watchful waiting approach), which is a population-level dimension, for example, recommendations for patients who likely have infections that are viral in nature or self-limiting. Additionally, 47.6% (385/808) recommendations considered both population-level and outcome-level AMR dimensions simultaneously. For example, fully immunised infant or school-aged children with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to hospital are recommended to take ampicillin or penicillin G given that local epidemiologic data lacks a substantial high level of penicillin resistance for invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae. 33 This recommendation is considering local resistance patterns (population-level dimension). It is also followed by an evidence summary the explains that lower costs of ampicillin or penicillin G need to be balanced by the increased possibility of emergence of resistance (outcomelevel dimension) that may occur from prescribing broadspectrum antimicrobials. About 22.5% (n=182/808) of recommendations considered local resistance patterns in a similar manner.  Credibility of international and regional guidelines with recommendations that consider AMR Overall, only 39.2% (n=29/74) of all international and regional guidelines had scores of 60% or greater in scope and purpose, rigour of development, and editorial independence. Of the 29 guidelines that met our credibility cut-off, 10 were developed in North America, 13 34-39 42 53 98 nine in Europe, 44 55 64 67 68 72-75 87 and two were developed in Asia. 80 82 When we compared international and regional guidelines, the majority of WHO guidelines performed significantly better than regional guidelines (table 3, online supplemental figure 1S ). Guidelines that did not meet our credibility cut-off score and excluded from further assessment included: 19 from North America, 17 from Europe, 5 from Asia and 3 guidelines from South America, Africa and Oceania. Guidelines considering values, resource use, acceptability, feasibility and equity Only 5 89 table 5S ). The WHO was the only guideline developer to report on all five criteria in four TB guidelines and one gonorrhoea guideline. Across all 29 guidelines, resource use was the most frequently considered (n=23 guidelines), followed by values (n=16 guidelines), acceptability (n=12 guidelines) and feasibility (n=12 guidelines). Equity was the least considered factor with only seven guidelines that made such considerations (figure 3): two were regionally and five were internationally developed. The WHO, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the US Preventative Task Force were the only organisations to consider equity. Regional guidelines tended to consider values, resource use, equity, acceptability and feasibility less than internationally developed guidelines (online supplemental figure 2S ). Most regional guidelines considered one (n=6/21) or two (n=6/21) or three (n=4/21) or none (n=4/21) of the above contextual factors. Values and resource use were considered the most, while equity, acceptability and feasibility were less considered in regionally developed guidelines (figure 4). Over a 13-year period, relatively few guidelines on antibiotics for highly prevalent infectious diseases included AMR considerations. Approximately 60% of regionally developed guidelines were of low quality and reported less factors required for tailoring recommendations to specific  contexts. International WHO guidelines had substantially higher quality scores than regional guidelines. International guidelines also consistently considered important information required for developing recommendations that are appropriate for specific contexts compared with regional guidelines. There is an emerging consensus that reporting of Evidence to Decision dimensions is ethically and scientifically essential. Unfortunately, reporting these dimensions is not always seen in practice. Our review highlighted that some of the proposed dimensions seemed to be adopted by guideline developers (ie, values and resource use were most considered), while others were less so (ie, acceptability, feasibility and equity were the least considered). Further, the quality of these guidelines varied and there were inconsistencies between regions and guidelines promoted/sponsored by different entities. The use of the GRADE Evidence to Decision framework by the WHO and NICE seems to positively influence the consideration of contextual factors in the guidelines we reviewed. A high proportion of WHO (n=5/7) and NICE (n=1/5) guidelines contained complete information necessary to provide optimal guidance on how to use antimicrobials in the considered syndromes. Other regional organisations provided limited information addressing contextual factors-most addressed one (n=6/21) or two (n=6/21) contextual factors and a good proportion did not address any (4/21). Our work has strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the extent to which guidelines are considering local dimensions such as AMR, and to use established frameworks: AGREE II and GRADE Evidence to Decision. We also employed systematic methods to conduct our review and validated tools to measure the quality of guidelines. 3 18 There are several limitations to our study. The use of a credibility score of 60% or greater for three of the six AGREE II domains is based on limited guidance on cut-off thresholds. However, by focusing on three domains and a low cut-off we were inclusive although we also focused on English language publications only. 3 99 We used general criteria from the GRADE Evidence to Decision Frameworks that are applicable to various interventions, and not specific to antimicrobials. These general dimensions could be complemented with specific criteria related to the antimicrobial field such as providing guidance on the appropriate threshold for escalating empiric antimicrobials from narrower spectrum agents to broad-spectrum agents. In other words, the real test for antimicrobial guidelines may be whether they enable prescribers and the public to fully consider the potential implications of antimicrobial prescribing on resistance. This would lead to virtuous and parsimonious prescribing and consumption habits. We previously found that about two thirds of respiratory tract infection recommendations on empirical antimicrobial use did not consider country-specific resistance patterns. The use of a broader framework and additional focus areas may have resulted in the larger number of recommendations that considered AMR uncovered by this study. Both studies support that there are inconsistencies in considering AMR in recommendation development and potential duplication of work among infectious disease guidelines. There are several implications for guideline developers. Given the suboptimal quality of guidelines in our sample, guideline methodology should improve particularly when recommendations move from global to regional levels. This includes improving the processes used in evidence syntheses and recommendation formulation, transparency and addressing potential unduly biases with competing interests. As far as regional guidelines need to incorporate contextual information when developing their recommendations, global guidelines need to provide information about how to contextualise recommendations for appropriate AMR considerations. Guideline development can be done more efficiently and economically by using work done by other developers including the WHO. Rather developing guidelines from scratch, time and resources 100 may be shifted towards refining AMR surveillance systems that provide national resistance data to support recommendations and appropriate antimicrobial use. Further, country-level participation of the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) supports global monitoring of resistance trends, emerging resistance and the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. 101 As of 2020, 94 countries are participating in GLASS. 101 However, some countries lack public health infrastructure, national laboratory capacities, and data management which is essential for Open access surveillance systems. 6 102 In 2018, there was at least one country within each WHO regions with the ability to collect national resistance data. 102 Regions facing unique challenges to antimicrobial stewardship capacities, may look to recommendations developed by other regions with similar resistance experiences. Finally, as new antimicrobial therapies become available, and the scientific community cumulates more evidence on resistance patterns and their implications for local prescribing, future infectious disease guidelines may require more frequent updating. Although we focused on recommendations on antimicrobial selection and prescribing, there are many other approaches that could be assessed in future research (eg, rapid diagnostics to rule-out viral infections and resistant strains). In addition, research should also explore whether recommendations are appropriately guided by evidence, resistance data and the WHO's Essential Medicines List and AWaRe Classification Database of Antimicrobials updates. 103 With regard to contextualisation of infectious disease recommendations, we have developed transparent recommendation maps that facilitate use of recommendations across jurisdictions for TB (https:// who. tuberculosis. recmap. org) and COVID-19 (https:// COVID-19. recmap. org) where we apply some of our findings.

The fourth objective of the Global Action Plan is to implement national and hospital treatment guidelines for the optimization of antimicrobial medicines use (2) . Guidelines are within a package of AMR stewardship interventions intended to modify clinician behavior by providing guidance on when, and how, to prescribe antimicrobials, integrating information on antimicrobial consumption, resistance surveillance, research and development, and burden of resistance (3) (4) (5) . Preservation of antimicrobials requires the consideration of how, and under what conditions, is it appropriate to recommend antimicrobials. However, only a scant minority of recently published guidelines considered epidemiological and resistance pattern data (6) . Concerns with guidelines in the context of AMR also involves the lack of considering important contextual factors. These include considering evidence on values, resource use, equity, acceptability, and feasibility that go beyond resistance patterns and may influence secular trends in AMR (7, 8) . For example, guideline recommendations that account for antimicrobial resistance burden, public health infrastructure and medicine policies, and equitability of antimicrobial regimens are likely to better support effective use of antimicrobials in specific contexts (9) . Such factors are also relevant for those implementing or adapting guidelines. These omissions likely result from the lack of formal guidance for developing recommendations that consider AMR and other local factors. Incomplete reporting of evidence supporting recommendations, and the 'develop from scratch' mentality results in additional challenges. Scientific societies and other organizations duplicate the same work to develop recommendations. In turn, having multiple guidelines on the same topic may lead to confusion and loss of confidence by clinicians, and resource waste (8, 10) . Through transparent reporting, and proper inclusion of AMR as more research becomes available, information can be effectively used in recommendations by others. Formal processes for adaptation permit societies and organizations to capitalize on existing evidence evaluation and interpretation by considering important contextual factors, among which AMR is the most noticeable. This would reduce cost and redundancy (7) . The objectives were to analyze how, and to what extent, guidelines are considering antimicrobial resistance; are of acceptable methodological quality; and if they can be easily contextualized to fit the needs of specific populations. We selected three types of infection: tuberculosis (TB), gonorrhoea, and respiratory tract infections, specifically otitis media, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and community-acquired pneumonia. These infections are a public health priority because they are becoming increasingly harder to treat due to AMR and/or are treated inappropriately, leading to higher risk of toxicity or resistance development. Harder to treat drug-resistant TB strains are increasing and projected to account for a quarter of all TB deaths by 2050 (11) . Neisseria gonorrhoea is an urgent public health threat (12) . The international spread of resistance to the last effective therapy, ceftriaxone and azithromycin, threatens sustained treatment of gonorrhoea (13, 14) . Otitis media, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and community-acquired pneumonia are prevalent and Streptococcus pneumoniae (the main causal microorganism), was classified as a serious public health threat due to resistance observed by inappropriate use of antibiotics (12, 15, 16) . All these syndromes have been prioritized by WHO as part of Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) -a new classification system that support a more nuanced approach to target inappropriate use of broad spectrum ""Watch"" antibiotics (17) . We included English language guidelines published between 2007 and 2019 on the above selected infections. We marked the 2007 WHO decision to update its guideline development and using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach as a major change in methodology, representing a division of two eras (18) . We limited the focus of our analyses to the era following this change. We included guidelines with clearly articulated recommendations as defined by the Institute of Amoxicillin-clavulanate rather than amoxicillin alone is recommended as empiric antimicrobial therapy for ABRS in adults (weak, low) (13) . Local national surveillance data in the United States of America for amoxicillin and beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae was narratively described in the evidence summary was clearly linked to the recommendation. In neonates with gonococcal conjunctivitis, the WHO STI guideline suggests one of the following treatment options: • ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg (maximum 150 mg) IM as a single dose • kanamycin 25 mg/kg (maximum 75 mg) IM as a single dose • spectinomycin 25 mg/kg (maximum 75 mg) IM as a single dose (19). The outcome of 'antimicrobial resistance' was formally considered within a PICO framework within a supplementary appendix. Bedaquiline should be included in longer MDR-TB regimens for patients aged 18 years or more (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the estimates of effect) (20). The recommendation considers a multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis patients, and the outcome 'acquisition (amplification) of drug resistance' (21) was formally considered within a PICO framework provided within a supplementary appendix. Alternative first choice of antibiotics for adults aged 18 years and over with pharyngitis and a penicillin allergy or intolerance: Clarithromycin 250 mg to 500 mg twice a day for 5 days (22) . Summary of committee discussions show that population-level resistance data was considered: ""based on evidence, clinical experience and resistance data, the committee agreed to recommend the following alternative first-choice antibiotics for use in penicillin allergy or for phenoxymethylpenicillin intolerance: clarithromycin or erythromycin (which is preferred in pregnancy)"" (22) . Additional formal outcome considerations include 'antibiotic resistance' in a supplementary appendix. We considered a guideline that reports information on any of the above dimensions in either the recommendation, accompanying evidence summaries, or PICO framework would be considered satisfactory. Whereas guidelines that generally discussed AMR as an issue, without linking information pertaining to AMR to each recommendation were considered unsatisfactory. We assessed a guideline's quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II Instrument focusing on three relevant domains: a well-defined scope and purpose (domain one), rigorous development including a systematic search for evidence, transparent reporting of methods, links between evidence and recommendations, external review, and procedures for update (domain three), and editorial independence (domain six) (23) . We defined acceptable quality as guidelines that scored 60% or greater in these three domains and allowed us to be inclusive (3) . We also abstracted information on values, resource use, equity, acceptability, and feasibility from guidelines that met our acceptability cut-off (i.e. 60%). Briefly, worldwide regions may differ in the accessibility of antimicrobials, the cultural view towards the use of antimicrobials, pharmaceutical costs, and health care structures. We selected these dimensions as the transparent reporting of these factors is essential: in appraising the evidence for antimicrobials, guideline developers should be aware of the breadth of implications of their recommendations when used by decision-makers (7, 10, 24, 25) . Guidelines that ignore this wider agenda could provide narrow, misleading guidance. We conducted descriptive statistics at the guideline and recommendation level, using counts and proportions (95%CI). We calculated the mean (SD) for AGREE II scores by region.

Of these, 78 guidelines had sufficient information for assessmentone gonorrhoea guideline was excluded because we were unable to retrieve supplementary materials (figure 1) (26) . After classifying recommendations, we found that 74 guidelines had at least one recommendation that considered AMR and four guidelines without such considerations (table 2) (27-30). These were excluded from further assessment. Of the 74 guidelines, the majority were developed in North America (n = 29), (13, 26, and Europe (n = 26) (22, 48, . A smaller portion were from Asia (n = 7), (82-88) South America (n = 1), (89) Africa (n = 1), (90) and Oceania (n = 1) (91) . Nine guidelines were internationally developed by the WHO (19-21, 92-97). we compared international and regional guidelines, the majority of WHO guidelines performed significantly better than regional guidelines (table 3). Guidelines that did not meet our credibility cut-off score and excluded from further assessment included: nineteen from North America, seventeen from Europe, five from Asia, and three guidelines from South America, Africa, and Oceania. Across all 29 guidelines, resource use was the most frequently considered (n = 23 guidelines), followed by values (n = 16 guidelines), acceptability (n = 12 guidelines), and feasibility (n = 12 guidelines). Equity was the least considered factor with only seven guidelines that made such considerations (figure 3): two were regionally and five were internationally developed. The WHO, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and the United States Preventative Task Force (USPSTF) were the only organizations to consider equity. Regional guidelines tended to consider values, resource use, equity, acceptability, and feasibility less than internationally developed guidelines. Most regional guidelines considered one (n = 6/21) or two (n = 6/21) or three (n = 4/21) or none (n = 4/21) of the above contextual factors. Values and resource use were considered the most, while equity, acceptability, and feasibility were less considered in regionally developed guidelines (figure 4). were of low quality, and tended to report less factors for contextualization of recommendations. International WHO guidelines had quality scores that were substantially better than regional guidelines. International guidelines also consistently considered important information required for developing recommendations that are appropriate for specific contexts compared to regional guidelines. The compliance of recommendations to consider contextual factors is often unsatisfactory despite the emerging consensus that the reporting of Evidence to Decision dimensions is ethically and scientifically essential. Some of the proposed criteria seemed to be adopted by guideline developers (i.e. values and resource use), while others were less so: guideline quality was variable among guidelines and there were inconsistencies between regions and guidelines promoted/sponsored by different entities. Frameworks including the GRADE Evidence to Decision and its use by the WHO and NICE, seem to positively influence the consideration of contextual factors in the guidelines we reviewed. A high proportion of WHO and NICE guidelines contained complete information necessary to provide optimal guidance on how to use antimicrobials in the considered syndromes addressing contextual factors. F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   Our work has strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the extent to which   guidelines are considering local dimensions such as AMR, and to use established frameworks: AGREE II, and GRADE Evidence to Decision. We also employed systematic methods to conduct our review and validated tools to measure the quality of guidelines (23, 99) . There are several limitations to our study. The use of the credibility cut-off score of 60% or greater for three of the six AGREE II domains is based on limited guidance on cut-off thresholds, but by focusing on three domains and a relatively low score we were more inclusive (3, 100) . We used criteria of the GRADE Evidence to Decision Frameworks that are fairly general as they apply to any interventions. These dimensions could be complemented with specific criteria related to the antimicrobial field. For example, providing guidance on the appropriate threshold for escalating empiric guidance from narrower spectrum agents to broader spectrum agents. In other words, the real test for antimicrobial guidelines may be whether they facilitate making the potential implications of antimicrobial prescribing on resistance fully considered by prescribers and the public. This would lead to virtuous and parsimonious prescribing and consumption habits. We previously found that about two thirds of respiratory tract infection recommendations on empirical antimicrobial use did not consider country-specific resistance patterns.

Five of the 29 guidelines reported all factors required for recommendation contextualization. Equity was the least considered across guidelines. Discussion: Relatively few guidelines for highly prevalent infectious diseases are considering resistance at a local level, and many do not consider contextual factors necessary for appropriate antimicrobial use. Improving the quality of guidelines targeting specific regional areas is required.  This is the first study to assess whether guidelines are considering local dimensions such as antimicrobial resistance.  We employed systematic methods and used established frameworks to assess the credibility of guidelines.  By focusing on three key AGREE II domains and a relatively low score we were is inclusive but we included only English language publications.  The use of the credibility cut-off score of 60% or greater for three of the six AGREE II domains is based on limited guidance on cut-off thresholds.  We used criteria of the GRADE Evidence to Decision Frameworks that are fairly general as they apply to any interventions and may need to be complemented with specific criteria related to the antimicrobial field. guidelines considered epidemiological and resistance pattern data (6) . There are also concerns that guidelines are not considering important contextual factors, including evidence on values, resource use, equity, acceptability, and feasibility that go beyond resistance patterns and that may influence secular trends in AMR (7, 8) . For example, guideline recommendations are likely to better support effective use of antimicrobials in specific contexts when they account for how much people value the affected health outcomes (""values""), antimicrobial resistance burden, public health infrastructure, local medicine policies for consistent access to safe, effective, affordable medicines, and equitability of antimicrobial regimens (9) . Considering these factors is also relevant for adapting and implementing. The failure to account for these factors likely  We selected three types of infection: tuberculosis (TB), gonorrhoea, and respiratory tract infections, specifically otitis media, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and community-acquired pneumonia. These infections are a public health priority because they are becoming increasingly harder to treat due to AMR and/or are treated inappropriately, leading to higher risk of toxicity or resistance development. Harder to treat drug-resistant TB strains are increasing and projected to account for a quarter of all TB deaths by 2050 (11) . Neisseria gonorrhoea is an urgent public health threat (12) . The international spread of resistance to the last effective therapy, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, threatens sustained treatment of gonorrhoea (13, 14) . Otitis media, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and community-acquired pneumonia are prevalent and Streptococcus pneumoniae (the main causal microorganism), was classified as a serious public health threat due to resistance observed by inappropriate use of antibiotics (12, 15, 16) . All these syndromes have been prioritized by WHO as part of Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) -a new classification system that supports a more nuanced approach to target inappropriate use of broad spectrum ""Watch"" antibiotics (17) . We included English language guidelines published between 2007 and 2019 on the above selected infections. We restricted to English language guidelines because, from a practical standpoint, English language publications would be the simplest to contextualize for most international groups and the major international organizations like WHO publish their guidelines at least in English. We marked the 2007 WHO decision to update its guideline development and using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach as a major change in methodology, representing a division of two eras (18) . We limited the focus of our analyses to the era following this change. We included guidelines with clearly articulated recommendations as defined by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical Practice Guidelines (14). After contacting guideline developers, we excluded guidelines with unobtainable supplementary 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   materials required for analysis (see supplement table 1S for our guideline and recommendation selection outlined in PICAR format). We in table 1, and supplement table 3S) . Although guidelines may have adopted different approaches to considering resistance with varying level of technicalities and detail, our operational definitions for considering a guideline ""compliant"" were inclusive. We assumed that for each recommendation, there would be an opportunity to consider information pertaining to AMR at the population-and outcome-level, 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 F o r p e e r r e v i e w o n l y Amoxicillin-clavulanate rather than amoxicillin alone is recommended as empiric antimicrobial therapy for ABRS in adults (weak, low) (13) . Local national surveillance data in the United States of America for amoxicillin and beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae was narratively described in the evidence summary was clearly linked to the recommendation. In neonates with gonococcal conjunctivitis, the WHO STI guideline suggests one of the following treatment options: • ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg (maximum 150 mg) IM as a single dose • kanamycin 25 mg/kg (maximum 75 mg) IM as a single dose • spectinomycin 25 mg/kg (maximum 75 mg) IM as a single dose (19). The outcome of 'antimicrobial resistance' was formally considered within a PICO framework within the guideline's supplementary materials.. Bedaquiline should be included in longer MDR-TB regimens for patients aged 18 years or more (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the estimates of effect) (20). The recommendation considers a multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis patients, and the outcome 'acquisition (amplification) of drug resistance' (21) was formally considered within a PICO framework provided within the guideline's supplementary materials.. Alternative first choice of antibiotics for adults aged 18 years and over with pharyngitis and a penicillin allergy or intolerance: Clarithromycin 250 mg to 500 mg twice a day for 5 days (22) . Summary of committee discussions show that populationlevel resistance data was considered: ""based on evidence, clinical experience and resistance data, the committee agreed to recommend the following alternative first-choice antibiotics for use in penicillin allergy or for phenoxymethylpenicillin intolerance: clarithromycin or erythromycin (which is preferred in pregnancy)"" (22) . Additional formal outcome considerations include 'antibiotic resistance' within the guideline's supplementary materials.. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y We considered a guideline satisfactory if it reports information on any of the above dimensions in either the recommendation, accompanying evidence summaries, or PICO framework. Whereas guidelines that generally discussed AMR as an issue, without linking information pertaining to AMR to each recommendation were considered unsatisfactory. We assessed a guideline's quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II Instrument focusing on three relevant domains: a well-defined scope and purpose (domain one), rigorous development including a systematic search for evidence, transparent reporting of methods, links between evidence and recommendations, external review, and procedures for update (domain three), and editorial independence (domain six) (23) . We defined acceptable quality as guidelines that scored 60% or greater in these three domains a priori based on limited guidance on cut-off thresholds (3, 24) . Focusing on these three domains and selecting a relatively low score, allowed us to be inclusive. We also abstracted information on values, resource use, equity, acceptability, and feasibility from guidelines that met our acceptability cut-off (i.e., 60%). Briefly, worldwide regions may differ in the accessibility of antimicrobials, the cultural view towards the use of antimicrobials, pharmaceutical costs, and health care structures. We selected these dimensions as the transparent reporting of these factors is essential: in appraising the evidence for antimicrobials, guideline developers should be aware of the breadth of implications of their recommendations when used by decision-makers (7, 10, 25, 26) . Guidelines that ignore this wider agenda could provide narrow, misleading guidance. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 We conducted descriptive statistics at the guideline and recommendation level, using counts and proportions (95%CI). We calculated the mean (SD) for AGREE II scores by region. We also compared the quality of guidelines from the WHO versus regional guidelines using scaled domain scores, mean difference, and a two-sided t-test. We calculated the frequency of guideline reporting of values, resource use, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. All analyses were  One of the authors is a patient with a rare disease affected by repeated infections and treatment related issues of resistance to antimicrobials and was involved in aspects of the design and data abstraction. We specifically looked for information about patient values and preferences and included this in our review. However, we did not make any additional specific efforts to involve the patient and public in other aspects of this systematic review. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  After classifying recommendations, we found that 74 guidelines had at least one recommendation that considered AMR and four guidelines without such considerations (table 2) (28-31). These were excluded from further assessment. Of the 74 guidelines, the majority were developed in North America (n = 29), (13, 27, and Europe (n = 26) (22, 49, . A smaller portion were from Asia (n = 7), (83-89) South America (n = 1), (90) Africa (n = 1), (91) and Oceania (n = 1) (92). Nine guidelines were internationally developed by the WHO (19-21, 93-98). 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y recommendations, 6·9% (n = 27/386) recommended no antimicrobial or back-up antimicrobial (i.e. the watchful waiting approach), which is a population-level dimension, e.g. recommendations for patients who likely have infections that are viral in nature or self-limiting. Additionally, 47·6% (385/808) recommendations considered both population-level and outcomelevel AMR dimensions simultaneously. For example, fully immunized infant or school-aged children with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to hospital are recommended to take ampicillin or penicillin G given that local epidemiologic data lacks a substantial high-level of penicillin-resistance for invasive S. pneumoniae (38). This recommendation is considering local resistance patterns (population-level dimension). It is also followed by an evidence summary the explains that lower costs of ampicillin or penicillin G need to be balanced by the increased possibility of emergence of resistance (outcome-level dimension) that may occur from prescribing broad-spectrum antimicrobials. About 22·5% (n = 182/808) of recommendations considered local resistance patterns in a similar manner. Overall, only 39·2% (n = 29/74) of all international and regional guidelines had scores of 60% or greater in scope and purpose, rigour of development, and editorial independence. Of the 29 guidelines that met our credibility cut-off, ten were developed in North America (13, 39-44, 47, 58, 99) , nine in Europe (22, 49, 68, 71, 72, (76) (77) (78) (79) 91) , and two were developed in Asia (84, 86) . When we compared international and regional guidelines, the majority of WHO guidelines performed significantly better than regional guidelines (table 3 and supplement, figure 1S ). Guidelines that did not meet our credibility cut-off score and excluded from further assessment Across all 29 guidelines, resource use was the most frequently considered (n = 23 guidelines), followed by values (n = 16 guidelines), acceptability (n = 12 guidelines), and feasibility (n = 12 guidelines). Equity was the least considered factor with only seven guidelines that made such considerations ( Figure 3 ): two were regionally and five were internationally developed. The WHO, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and the United States Preventative Task Force (USPSTF) were the only organizations to consider equity. Regional guidelines tended to consider values, resource use, equity, acceptability, and feasibility less than internationally developed guidelines (supplement, figure 2S ). Most regional guidelines considered one (n = 6/21) or two (n = 6/21) or three (n = 4/21) or none (n = 4/21) of the above contextual factors. Values and resource use were considered the most, while equity, acceptability, and feasibility were less considered in regionally developed guidelines ( Figure 4 ). Over a 13-year period, relatively few guidelines on antibiotics for highly prevalent infectious diseases included AMR considerations. Approximately 60% of regionally developed guidelines were of low quality and reported less factors required for tailoring recommendations to specific contexts. International WHO guidelines had substantially higher quality scores than regional guidelines. International guidelines also consistently considered important information required for developing recommendations that are appropriate for specific contexts compared to regional guidelines. There is an emerging consensus that reporting of Evidence to Decision dimensions is ethically and scientifically essential. Unfortunately, reporting these dimensions is not always seen in practice. Our review highlighted that some of the proposed dimensions seemed to be adopted by guideline developers (i.e., values and resource use were most considered), while others were less so (i.e., acceptability, feasibility, and equity were the least considered). Further, the quality of these guidelines varied and there were inconsistencies between regions and guidelines promoted/sponsored by different entities. The use of the GRADE Evidence to Decision framework by the WHO and NICE seems to positively influence the consideration of contextual factors in the guidelines we reviewed. A high proportion of WHO (n=5/7) and NICE (n=1/5) guidelines contained complete information necessary to provide optimal guidance on how to use antimicrobials in the considered syndromes. Other regional organizations provided limited information addressing contextual factors -most addressed one (n=6/21) or two (n=6/21) contextual factors and a good proportion did not address any (4/21). Our work has strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the extent to which guidelines are considering local dimensions such as AMR, and to use established frameworks: AGREE II, and GRADE Evidence to Decision. We also employed systematic methods to conduct our review and validated tools to measure the quality of guidelines (23, 100) . There are several limitations to our study. The use of a credibility score of 60% or greater for three of the six AGREE II domains is based on limited guidance on cut-off thresholds. However, by focusing on three domains and a low cut-off we were inclusive although we also focused on (3, 101) . We used general criteria from the GRADE Evidence to Decision Frameworks that are applicable to various interventions, and not specific to antimicrobials. These general dimensions could be complemented with specific criteria related to the antimicrobial field such as providing guidance on the appropriate threshold for escalating empiric antimicrobials from narrower spectrum agents to broader spectrum agents. In other words, the real test for antimicrobial guidelines may be whether they enable prescribers and the public to fully consider the potential implications of antimicrobial prescribing on resistance. This would lead to virtuous and parsimonious prescribing and consumption habits. We previously found that about two thirds of respiratory tract infection recommendations on empirical antimicrobial use did not consider country-specific resistance patterns. The use of a broader framework and additional focus areas may have resulted in the larger number of recommendations that considered AMR uncovered by this study. Both studies support that there are inconsistencies in considering AMR in recommendation development and potential duplication of work among infectious disease guidelines. There are several implications for guideline developers. Given the suboptimal quality of guidelines in our sample, guideline methodology should improve particularly when recommendations move from global to regional levels. This includes improving the processes used in evidence syntheses and recommendation formulation, transparency, and addressing potential unduly biases with competing interests. As far as regional guidelines need to incorporate contextual information when developing their recommendations, global guidelines we apply some of our findings.

The objectives were to analyse (1) how, and to what extent, tuberculosis, gonorrhoea and respiratory tract infection guidelines are considering antimicrobial resistance; (2) are of acceptable quality and (3) if they can be easily contextualised to fit the needs of specific populations and health systems. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and searched Ovid MEDLINE and Embase from 1 January 2007 to 7 June 2019 for tuberculosis, gonorrhoea and respiratory tract infection guidelines published in English. We also searched guideline databases, key websites and reference lists. We identified guidelines and recommendations that considered contextual factors including antimicrobial resistance, values, resource use, equity, acceptability and feasibility. We assessed quality of the guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool focusing on the domains scope and purpose, rigour of development, and editorial independence. RESULTS: We screened 10 365 records, of which 74 guidelines met inclusion criteria. Of these guidelines, 39% (n=29/74) met acceptable quality scores. Approximately two-thirds of recommendations considered antimicrobial resistance at the population and/or outcome level. Five of the 29 guidelines reported all factors required for recommendation contextualisation. Equity was the least considered across guidelines. DISCUSSION: Relatively few guidelines for highly prevalent infectious diseases are considering resistance at a local level, and many do not consider contextual factors necessary for appropriate antimicrobial use. Improving the quality of guidelines targeting specific regional areas is required. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020145235."
"Durante la pandemia di COVID-19 del 2019-2020, molti stati hanno fatto ricorso ad una politica di lockdown, in alcuni casi ancora in corso, che ha interessato milioni di cittadini, istituzioni e aziende per il contenimento e contrasto del diffondersi del virus. L'Italia, insieme alla Cina, è stata tra i primi paesi ad applicare tale politica di restrizioni ad ampio raggio che ha, ovviamente, interessato anche istituzioni e luoghi di cultura. In tale periodo, diverse iniziative comunicative a vari livelli sono state intraprese per aumentare la consapevolezza dei cittadini in riferimento alla necessità di modificare temporaneamente comportamenti e abitudini di vita e offrire supporto e incoraggiamento per affrontare il nuovo scenario. In particolare, le istituzioni culturali, quali musei e gallerie d'arte, hanno dato vita a un'ampia gamma di azioni, utilizzando le principali piattaforme social (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) e richiedendo la partecipazione attiva degli utenti a tali iniziative. Il coinvolgimento degli utenti, che, in fase di lockdown, poteva avvenire solo tramite una forma mediata, sembra perseguire due obiettivi principali: (i) mantenere attivo il canale comunicativo con il pubblico; (ii) garantire l'accesso ai contenuti culturali non fruibili di persona a causa delle limitazioni dovute alla politica di restrizione degli spostamenti fisici per tutti i cittadini. L'uso degli strumenti social si è rivelato fondamentale per assolvere la funzione culturale e la funzione comunicativa, che, come ricorda Antinucci (2004:10) , ""sono inscindibili, giacché l'una presuppone l'altra"". Privati della possibilità di dialogare con il pubblico in maniera diretta e di comunicare i loro contenuti nel contesto tradizionale di fruizione, le istituzioni hanno sfruttato pienamente le potenzialità della nuova modalità comunicativa. Uno dei fenomeni, immediatamente evidente, nella maggior parte delle interazioni promosse da istituzioni culturali attraverso tutti i social media, è l'utilizzo di una serie di #hashtag (#) ad accompagnare il contenuto visivo e testuale proposto. Gli #hashtag, parole chiave assegnate alle informazioni, nate per descrivere i contenuti su Twitter e guidarne la stessa ricerca, rappresentano un elemento centrale per organizzare le informazioni, in quanto contribuiscono a raggruppare le discussioni relative ad argomenti o eventi specifici (Small, 2011) . Alcuni studi in altri settori, in particolare nei settori del marketing e della comunicazione, ma anche di Business Intelligence , riconoscono il ruolo degli #hashtag nel contribuire all'innovazione delle knowledge organizations in un contesto, come quello attuale, in cui proliferano contenuti generati dagli utenti (Chang, 2010) . Infatti, secondo lo studio proposto da Chang (2010) , la teoria della Diffusion of Innovation può contribuire a esaminare la diffusione nell'uso e adozione degli #hashtag all'interno di un sistema social. La necessità di organizzare le informazioni e i contenuti intorno ad argomenti specifici, in modo da facilitarne il successivo recupero, ha causato una ampia adozione degli #hashtag. Tale adozione ha dato vita a veri e propri archivi di informazioni, risultato di uno sforzo collettivo, cui partecipano attivamente tutti coloro che contribuiscono ad aggregare i contenuti nello stesso flusso identificato da uno specifico #hashtag. A dimostrazione dell'importanza degli #hashtag nell'aggregare contenuti e utenti, nel 2015 Twitter introduce l'#hashtag #culturalheritage, per rispondere all'interesse dimostrato degli utenti verso i contenuti e gli eventi culturali. L'opportunità offerta dalla connessione tra #hashtag e contenuti culturali è stata analizzata in studi recenti, anche se con una limitata attenzione al potenziale e all'efficacia degli impulsi e attività social per supportare le istituzioni nella promozione dei beni culturali (Chianese et al., 2016) . L'uso degli #hashtag si è successivamente ampliato travalicando i confini di Twitter e diventando un elemento portante nella costruzione di comunità virtuali che si identificano nel messaggio e intorno al quale costruiscono relazioni, migliorando la comunicazione tra i membri che aderiscono alla comunità (Mulyadi and Fitriana, 2018) . Marulli et al. (2015) propongono un approccio basato su ontologie per valutare l'interesse e la sensibilità degli utenti ai contenuti dei beni culturali attraverso le loro attività sui social network, in particolare Twitter. I risultati di tale indagine quantitativa, che combina il trattamento automatico del linguaggio (TAL), le tecnologie semantiche e l'analisi temporale e geo-referenziata, misurano l'atteggiamento degli utenti rispetto agli oggetti dei beni culturali, la densità geografica dei luoghi in cui fruire contenuti culturali e la prossimità temporale ad eventi legati ai beni culturali. L'analisi dell'uso e della diffusione degli #hashtag, quindi, rappresenta, alla luce delle numerose variabili che possono essere considerate, una interessante sorgente di informazioni sui comportamenti delle istituzioni e degli utenti che interagiscono con queste e con i contenuti culturali in generale. Il presente report si basa su una prima indagine degli #hashtag prodotti e utilizzati dalle istituzioni culturali italiane durante il periodo di lockdown nell'arco temporale che va dal 08/03/2020, data in cui è stato emanato il Decreto del Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri (DPCM 8 marzo 2020) che corrisponde a quella che è stata denominata Fase 1 e che ha sancito l'inizio delle restrizioni dovute alle misure per il contenimento e il contrasto del Covid-19 sull'intero territorio nazionale, al 04/05/2020, data in cui il DPCM 26 Aprile 2020 stabiliva l'allentamento di tali misure dando inizio alla cosiddetta Fase 2 . 1 Il particolare periodo preso in considerazione rappresenta uno scenario interessante di ricerca per analizzare come le istituzioni culturali hanno risposto ad un evento che, di fatto, mutava le condizioni di comunicazione in cui operare e come gli utenti hanno reagito a questa nuova forma in cui sono stati proposti dei contenuti culturali. 1 È importante sottolineare che il DPCM 26 Aprile 2020 non sancisce la riapertura dei luoghi della cultura al 4 maggio, bensì al 18 maggio. Tuttavia, si è scelto di concentrare l'analisi e la raccolta dei dati in riferimento al primo periodo di lockdown in quanto più restrittivo per tutte le attività della popolazione italiana e che, quindi, può essere considerato maggiormente interessante per valutare le reazioni degli utenti alle iniziative delle istituzioni culturali. Lo studio è stata condotto tenendo conto di tre livelli di analisi: (i) il modo in cui le istituzioni culturali hanno curato la comunicazione attraverso i social nel periodo definito Fase 1 per confermare o rafforzare la loro presenza, proponendo nuove iniziative e contenuti agli utenti; (ii) il grado di partecipazione da parte del pubblico alle iniziative; (iii) la dimensione temporale che ha causato la sospensione improvvisa delle attività culturali in presenza, modificando drasticamente il comportamento del pubblico di tali istituzioni e azzerando di fatto la fruizione diretta dei contenuti culturali proposti dai luoghi di cultura.@story_separate@Durante il periodo di lockdown, numerose iniziative di divulgazione dei contenuti culturali attraverso i social network sono state caratterizzate dall'uso di #hashtag. Tale uso, contribuendo all'aggregazione delle informazioni, ha incentivato la creazione di un luogo di cultura virtuale in cui musei e istituzioni hanno concentrato le loro attività di comunicazione con il loro pubblico tradizionale e con potenziali nuovi utenti. Dinanzi all'ampio ventaglio di proposte che i musei hanno lanciato, l'International Council Of Museums (ICOM), la principale organizzazione internazionale che rappresenta i musei e i suoi 2 professionisti, già pochi giorni dopo la diffusione di tali iniziative, ha stilato un elenco contenente i casi studio che sono sembrati essere più stimolanti e meglio pensati per raggiungere il pubblico da remoto . Tra questi rientrano coloro che hanno digitalizzato il contenuto delle 3 proprie collezioni, come ad esempio lo Smithsonian, l'istituto di ricerca fondato a Washington nel 1846, che ha pubblicato su una piattaforma accessibile a tutti 2,8 milioni di immagini ad alta risoluzione , e coloro che hanno incrementato l'utilizzo dei canali social, Facebook primo tra 4 tutti, seguito da Instagram, Twitter e altri , offrendo agli utenti tour in diretta tra i propri 5 capolavori, spesso illustrati dai direttori dei musei, come ad esempio la passeggiata virtuale offerta dal Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). 6 Se Instagram è stato usato come vetrina attraverso la quale artisti e professionisti del settore hanno intrattenuto momenti conversevoli con un pubblico di interessati utilizzando la formula della ""diretta"", Twitter, che permette un approccio meno interattivo in tal senso, è stato adottato da alcuni musei come strumento per coinvolgere il proprio pubblico in modo divertente, Zoomando sull'Italia, ci si rende conto che anche qui le istituzioni nazionali -musei, gallerie, fondazioni -non hanno atteso a far avvertire la propria presenza e hanno messo in atto tutte le risorse a disposizione per restare in contatto con il proprio pubblico , garantendo l'accesso al 9 nuovo luogo di cultura virtuale attraverso l'uso degli #hashtag. Il presente studio si basa sull'analisi di un set di #hashtag utilizzati per rispondere alla situazione inaspettata di lockdown che ha creato un gap comunicativo improvviso con gli utenti. In generale, l'utilizzo degli #hashtag in tale contesto ha assunto due compiti: mantenere attivo un canale di comunicazione con il pubblico e offrire modalità di fruizione alternative dei contenuti culturali di cui tali istituzioni sono depositarie. L'indagine ha preso in considerazione lo specifico spazio virtuale creato dagli #hashtag che le istituzioni culturali hanno utilizzato nella promozione e nella comunicazione durante la Fase 1, in particolare sul social network Twitter. Le specifiche caratteristiche di questa piattaforma hanno fatto sì che la sua adozione da parte delle istituzioni culturali italiane fosse graduale, se si considerano i dati rilevati dall'Osservatorio Innovazione Digitale nei Beni e Attività Culturali in seguito a un'analisi effettuata su un campione di musei in relazione all'attività da loro svolta nel 2016 . Da quegli anni ad oggi, la percentuale dei musei italiani che usano Twitter è passata dal 10 31% al 33% nel biennio successivo (2017-18) . Il periodo di lockdown ha drasticamente incrementato le attività e la presenza online delle istituzioni, come indicato dal report NEMO, in cui sono stati analizzati differenti dati relativi alla chiusura forzata. In particolare, il report evidenzia che, dopo tre settimane di chiusura al pubblico, circa l'80% dei musei ha incrementato la propria attività online, come reazione alla generale visibilità in crescita dei beni culturali fruiti in questa modalità. In riferimento a Twitter, si rivolge l'attenzione non tanto a quanti musei hanno iniziato a usarlo, ma piuttosto a come hanno iniziato a usufruirne, poiché, se prima della pandemia la piattaforma social era considerata soltanto uno dei tanti mezzi di comunicazione, con un minimo obiettivo di engagement del pubblico, a causa delle misure di social distancing sembra essere diventato una risorsa 7 https://medium.com/@AkronArtMuseum/musegames-round-two-60b71939e030 8 https://www.jigsawplanet.com/?rc=play&pid=01e489a945b2 9 https://www.artribune.com/arti-visive/arte-contemporanea/2020/03/iorestoacasa-musei-covid-19-contenut i-online-guida/78/ 10 https://www.osservatori.net/it_it/osservatori/comunicati-stampa/il-52-dei-musei-italiani-e-social-ma-i-serv izi-digitali-per-la-fruizione-delle-opere-sono-limitati 11 https://www.statista.com/statistics/553443/share-of-museums-using-on-social-media-by-platform-italy/ irrinunciabile. Tuttavia, l'impiego di questa piattaforma richiede una buona capacità di sintesi e un linguaggio efficacemente adoperato per raccontare eventi e fornire informazioni ad esso correlate, come nel caso di una mostra o di qualunque iniziativa lanciata da un museo (Mandarano, 2019:102). D'altro canto, Marulli et al. (2015) ricordano come il settore dei beni culturali possa trarre vantaggio da queste tecnologie della comunicazione e dell'informazione, sviluppando nuove strategie per coinvolgere e attrarre un numero maggiore di utenti. Il particolare contesto, creatosi per l'evento pandemico, ha causato la necessità di modificare il modo in cui le istituzioni culturali sfruttano questi canali, ampliando i fini per i quali le stesse istituzioni hanno iniziato a usare tali tecnologie, ovvero attrarre visitatori alle mostre o promuovere una serie di servizi collegati. La raccolta dei dati in forma di tweet è stata effettuata a partire da un set di #hashtag predominanti nei post delle principali istituzioni culturali e del MiBACT sulle piattaforme social, durante il momento iniziale della cosiddetta Fase 1. La prima selezione manuale ha incluso un totale di 33 #hashtag, fra quelli riportati dalla piattaforma Twitter tra i trend topics in tale periodo . Sulla base di questa selezione iniziale, è stato creato un primo dataset includendo i tweet pubblicati nell'arco di tempo che va dal 08/03/2020 al 04/05/2020, che presentassero uno o più degli #hashtag individuati (Annex -Tabella 1 ). In totale, questo dataset contiene 23716 tweet, che sono stati raccolti attraverso Python 3.6 e la librerie GetOldTweets . Il set iniziale di #hashtag, ordinato in base al numero di retweet per ciascuno, è stato successivamente suddiviso in base a un criterio temporale di creazione degli aggregatori stessi, individuando due macro-categorie: quelli esistenti prima della diffusione del virus COVID-19 e dell'entrata in vigore delle relative misure di restrizione, e quelli che sono stati creati ad hoc durante periodo di lockdown. Per quanto riguarda gli #hashtag del primo gruppo (riportati in grigio in Tabella 1 ), questi compaiono sulla homepage di Twitter già in un momento precedente a quello compreso tra la fine del 2019 e l'inizio del 2020, ma al fine di incentivare il pubblico costretto a stare in casa a fruire dei contenuti culturali, essi sono stati riutilizzati dai musei per sostenere le proprie iniziative. È il caso, ad esempio, dell'hashtag # ABCBarberiniCorsini , che riassume l'idea elaborata dallo staff della Galleria Barberini Corsini di Roma di diffondere la conoscenza delle opere della propria collezione. La proposta è stata lanciata il 16 ottobre 2019 ed è stata nuovamente sottoposta all'attenzione del pubblico l'11 marzo 2020, vale a dire due giorni dopo la chiusura dei musei sancita dall'emanazione del DPCM 8 marzo 2020. Tra gli #hashtag più generici, cioè quelli che non fanno riferimento a una singola iniziativa, ma che rimandano a delle macrocategorie o macrotemi, si nota una corposa interazione dell'hashtag # museitaliani , che sui social network è presente anche nella variante grafica # museiitaliani . Sulle diverse piattaforme social è l'#hashtag ufficiale adottato dalla Direzione generale Musei , organo funzionario del MiBACT, ed è l'aggregatore con il quale si vogliono 13 rendere note le opere, i capolavori, il luoghi della cultura del Sistema Museale Nazionale italiano. Proprio per la mission per cui nasce questa etichetta, si può affermare che essa esiste da prima del filone Musei e COVID, ma di sicuro ha contribuito non poco a rafforzare la presenza anche dei musei italiani, per l'appunto, come interlocutori di un dialogo che, senza voce, coinvolge utenti e istituzioni di tutto il mondo. Diversa è l'opinione per #artchallenge , che, sebbene sia stato utilizzato in molti testi brevi, presenta ben pochi riferimenti al contesto pandemico. Dal punto di vista geografico, il suo uso si colloca nei paesi oltreoceano e oltremanica; sui casi di applicazione, invece, risulta essere adoperato a grandi linee da utenti che si occupano di grafica, di disegno e che hanno tra i propri interessi la cultura dei Manga. Nella stessa Tabella 1 , sono riportati anche gli #hashtag che sono stati creati dai musei per far sentire fortemente la propria presenza sui social e per fare in modo che il pubblico ne fosse consapevole, nonostante la momentanea chiusura forzata delle sale di esposizione. Al fine di evitare rumore nei dati e focalizzarci su un set ridotto di #hashtag, nella analisi successive abbiamo deciso di non considerare gli #hashtag con numero totale di tweet nel periodo di interesse inferiore a 1000 e gli #hashtag che, pur avendo un numero di tweet relativi abbastanza elevato, sono stati usati prevalentemente da organizzazioni straniere o in contesti non strettamente connessi ai beni culturali ( #cultureinquarantine , #artchallenge in Tabella 1 ). Il numero totale di #hashtag selezionati è sei, di cui alcuni pre-esistenti al periodo di lockdown, come # museitaliani , ma riutilizzati in occasione delle nuove attività del periodo pandemico.Tale selezione ha portato ad una cernita dei tweet presenti nel dataset iniziale, prendendo in esame un totale di 15988 tweet prodotti utilizzando almeno uno dei sei #hashtag di interesse (Annex -Tabella 2 ). Nella Tabella 2 è possibile avere un quadro del numero di interazioni, in termini di dati disaggregati in tweet e retweet, per ognuno dei sei #hashtag presi in considerazione. Sulla base del numero di interazioni generate, un discorso e un'analisi a parte merita #ArTyouReady, #hashtag di nuova creazione, che con 16237 retweet nel periodo di Fase 1, si candida a ricoprire il ruolo di aggregatore tematico più diffuso e noto. Infine, attraverso la libreria Tweepy sono state poi raccolte informazioni aggiuntive sugli utenti, 14 in particolare: quanti e quali utenti fossero verificati e l'area geografica di appartenenza. Dagli utenti verificati, infine, sono stati separati gli account appartenenti a istituzioni e organizzazioni culturali italiane. In questa prima fase di analisi i dati sono stati aggregati utilizzando diverse variabili, prima tra tutte quella temporale. Infatti, l'andamento di ognuno dei sei #hashtag scelti in termini di interazioni nell'arco temporale in considerazione è indice sia della capacità delle istituzioni di rispondere alla situazione mutata sia del successo dell'azione comunicativa delle istituzioni. Creazione e uso degli #hashtag . Il grafico in Figura 1 riporta l'andamento degli #hashtag che sono stati analizzati all'interno del periodo di riferimento. Come si evince dal picco in esso rappresentato, si registra un incremento nell'uso di quasi tutti gli #hashtag, ad eccezione di # cultureinquarantine e # laculturaincasa , in corrispondenza del giorno 29/03. Tale data corrisponde al lancio dell'iniziativa # ArTyouReady . Questo #hashtag e l'iniziativa ad esso collegata hanno avuto una risonanza molto ampia, come dimostrato non solo dal picco nel numero di interazioni generate ma anche dal fatto che a parlarne sono stati i tg nazionali e alcune testate giornalistiche internazionali . La proposta promossa dal Ministero per i beni e le attività culturali e per il turismo (MiBACT) è 17 stata inizialmente concepita come un flashmob digitale dedicato alla fotografia ed è stato richiesto agli utenti di condividere gli scatti che essi avevano precedentemente effettuato all'interno dei musei; un tentativo per mantenere vivo il patrimonio culturale racchiuso all'interno dei musei resi necessariamente deserti, e ciò che la contraddistingue è la combinazione di #hashtag che di volta in volta si accompagnano a quello principale, ovvero # ArTyouReady , come etichetta che segnala il significato delle proposte che vengono avanzate. La prima edizione del 29 marzo 2020 prevede una riflessione sulla chiusura dei musei che viene resa con la formula # emptymuseum e a questa ne sono seguite altre che per tutto il mese di aprile, ogni domenica, hanno coinvolto gli utenti in modo diverso. Il 5 aprile sul sito web del MiBACT e sui propri canali social viene lanciato l'#hashtag # ArTyouReady insieme al # GrandVirtualTour , con lo scopo di ottenere da parte degli utenti una ricostruzione di un viaggio digitale lungo tutta la Penisola postando le foto che essi hanno scattato nei luoghi della cultura. La proposta calendarizzata il 12 aprile arricchisce l'iniziativa originaria di un aspetto più creativo, perché con l'# artetisomiglia , storica campagna istituzionale del MiBACT risalente al gennaio 2017, gli utenti si divertono a postare sui social foto ritraenti sé stessi mentre imitano un'opera d'arte con ciò che hanno in casa. L'evento, dalla portata internazionale, è stato replicato anche dal Getty Museum di Los Angeles, che si è lasciato ispirare dal Rijksmuseum di Amsterdam e da un account instagram denominato # tussenqunstenquarantine (Tra Arte e Quarantena). I protagonisti del quarto appuntamento di # ArTyouReady , previsto per il giorno 19 aprile, sono i giardini, il mare, le colline, i borghi, le montagne e i tramonti che rivivono negli scatti fatti dagli utenti che apprezzano il # paesaggioitaliano ; è proprio questo l'#hashtag usato per la penultima edizione del flashmob fotografico. In occasione dell'ultimo incontro, avvenuto il 26 aprile, il MiBACT in collaborazione con Office de Tourisme Italien -ENIT e Touring Club Italiano, sviluppando l'idea precedente del paesaggio italiano, conclude il tema del viaggio che, dalla seconda alla quarta edizione è passato dall'essere virtuale all'essere fisico; con l'#hashtag # viaggioinitalia si condividono sui social foto di antiche mappe che ricostruiscono la morfologia del territorio italiano negli anni. Diffusione degli #hashtag. La Figura 2 riporta l'andamento degli #hashtag usati nei tweet nel mese di marzo. Come si può vedere, dopo un leggero incremento registrato in corrispondenza del 13/03, la linea rimane piatta fino ad arrivare al giorno 28/03, data in cui inizia a crescere per raggiungere il picco massimo il 29/03, e decrescere nei giorni successivi, con una leggera variazione nei giorni 04/04, 05/04, 06/04, dovuta al rilancio dell'iniziativa # ArTyouReady sui canali social. La Figura 3 riporta l'andamento degli #hashtag usati nei tweet nel mese di aprile. Tra quelli presenti, si può notare un trend costante per l'#hashtag # emptymuseum , con un leggero incremento il giorno 23/04. L#'hashtag # museichiusimuseiaperti presenta una crescita più o meno costante, con un sensibile incremento in corrispondenza del periodo compreso tra il 29/04 e il 01/05. I momenti di crescita che riguardano l'#hashtag # ArTyouReady corrispondo ai giorni nei quali l'iniziativa è stata riproposta dalle istituzioni (19/04, 26/04 e 03/05) e a quelli immediatamente precedenti, durante i quali è stata ""pubblicizzata"". Per tutte le altre etichette, si nota un considerevole incremento a cavallo tra la fine del mese di aprile e l'inizio del mese di maggio, nel periodo circoscritto ai giorni 22/04 e 04/05. L'incremento registrato in questo lasso temporale è probabilmente dovuto alla corrispondenza con altre attività che hanno avuto luogo nei giorni di maggior interesse: Giornata mondiale del libro (23/05/2020), Giornata Internazionale della Danza (29/04) e Festa dei lavoratori (01/05/2020). Gli #hashtag che sono associati a queste iniziative, rispettivamente # giornatamondialedellibro , # giornatamondialedelladanza e # Festadeilavoratori , sono utilizzati dagli utenti di twitter insieme all'#hashtag più generale # laculturanonsiferma , come evidenziato dai risultati di un ricerca manuale effettuata su Twitter. La Figura 4 riporta l'andamento dei retweet per #hashtag in riferimento al mese di marzo. Si può notare un incremento delle attività in corrispondenza dei giorni 28 -30 marzo, e un più leggero aumento in riferimento ai primi giorni del mese di aprile. La Figura 5 riporta l'andamento dei retweet per #hashtag in riferimento all'intero mese di aprile e ai primi quattro giorni del mese di maggio. Il trend di crescita delle interazioni è più o meno costante per tutti gli #hashtag, fatta eccezione per l'#hashtag # ArTyouReady che è stato maggiormente ritwittato dagli utenti nei giorni 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26 e 27 aprile, e nei primi giorni di maggio. In Tabella 3 è riportato il numero di utenti unici che hanno risposto alle iniziative scrivendo dei tweet nei quali compare uno o più #hashtag tra quelli selezionati. Per 'utenti unici' si intendono quegli utenti che hanno utilizzato l'etichetta almeno una volta nella formulazione dei propri tweet, e sono stati, quindi, registrati una sola volta nel conteggio automatico. Il totale riportato per ogni hashtag comprende gli utenti semplici e le istituzioni ufficiali, sulla cui distinzione si rimanda al paragrafo successivo. I dati rivelano un ampio uso dell'#hashtag # ArTyouReady , seguito da # emptymuseum . Tuttavia, bisogna notare che questa etichetta è stata utilizzata da una quantità di utenti pari a circa la metà di coloro che hanno creato dei tweet contenenti l'#hashtag # ArTyouReady , sebbene i due #hashtag facciano parte della stessa iniziativa e siano stati lanciati da un'unica istituzione in una sola data. Tale differenza può essere dovuta al fatto che # ArTyouReady abbia raggiunto una notorietà maggiore e sia stato, per questo motivo, associato a più contenuti, in maniera indipendente da # emptymusuem . Le istituzioni coinvolte. La Tabella 4 riporta per ogni #hashtag il numero delle istituzioni che li hanno utilizzati. Dopo aver estratto automaticamente tutti gli utenti per ogni #hashtag, questi sono stati analizzati per essere suddivisi in i) utenti semplici e ii) istituzioni culturali. Di queste due categorie è stata presa in esame la seconda che conta un totale di 389 istituzioni che hanno utilizzato almeno uno dei sei #hashtag. Il gruppo delle istituzioni è stato successivamente suddiviso in base alla tipologia di istituzione culturale, di cui sono state individuate sedici categorie diverse, ridotte a tredici attraverso un ulteriore raggruppamento di tre di queste (Ministero per i beni e le attività culturali e il turismo -MiBACT; Soprintendenza Archeologica Belle Arti e Paesaggio -SABAP; Organizzazione delle Nazioni Unite per l'educazione, la scienza e la cultura -UNESCO) sotto la definizione più ampia di Ente. Tra quelle indicate, si comprende che la categoria Museo è stata quella che ha risposto con maggior prontezza all'uso di tali #hashtag nei momenti di comunicazione social, utilizzando tutti gli #hashtag che presentano un alto numero di interazioni. Da notare che l'#hashtag # laculturaincasa è stato utilizzato soltanto da musei, teatri e biblioteche, mentre # emptymusem , # laculturanonsiferma e # museichiusimuseiaperti sono gli #hashtag che presentano una maggiore diffusione tra le tipologie differenti di istituzioni ( Tabella 4 ). I grafici (Figure 6 -10) mostrano nel dettaglio l'uso degli #hashtag da parte di ciascuna istituzione per l'intero periodo considerato. Per alcuni di questi (i.e., # artyouready e # museitaliani ) il MiBACT risulta essere l'utilizzatore più attivo. Tra le istituzioni locali che ricorrono all'hashtag # museichiusimuseiaperti per lanciare le proprie iniziative, di particolare rilievo è la presenza del Museo Tattile di Varese, in quanto istituzione creatrice di questo #hashtag e realtà museale, che, sebbene di piccole dimensioni, ha sfruttato il nuovo canale di comunicazione in modo ampio con numerosi tweet. È da sottolineare che, tra le istituzioni che utilizzano gli #hashtag analizzati, il numero dei cosiddetti grandi attrattori è ridotto; notiamo, ad esempio, la presenza del Museo Archeologico di Napoli (MANN) in Figura 7 per i tweet associati a # emptymuseum . Il fenomeno della limitata presenza può essere spiegato dal fatto che molti di questi attrattori utilizzavano già nel periodo pre-pandemico degli #hashtag, spesso legati al loro nome e alla loro identità istituzionale molto forte, ed hanno mantenuto tali etichette anche nel periodo oggetto di analisi. In altri casi, invece, nonostante l'associazione di uno degli #hashtag selezionati ai loro contenuti, queste istituzioni hanno privilegiato altre piattaforme social per la veicolazione dei loro contenuti e la comunicazioni con il loro pubblico. Per ognuno degli account delle istituzioni che hanno partecipato alle iniziative è stata raccolta, laddove presente, la posizione geografica relativa all'account stesso. In seguito, attraverso le librerie di Python geopy e basemap , queste posizioni sono state trasformate in coordinate e 19 20 mappate in relazione al numero di tweet creati dagli account aventi nel testo uno o più degli #hashtag selezionati. I dati raccolti sono presentati in Figura 11 , che mostra una corposa concentrazione nelle aree del nord e del centro Italia, dove si ritrovano iniziative più partecipate per gli #hastag selezionati, con un'attività nelle zone del meridione e nelle isole caratterizzata da iniziative che, seppur abbastanza numerose, non possono essere considerate particolarmente rilevanti, ad eccezione di poche, nei centri che hanno istituzioni di un certo rilievo nazionale (ad esempio il Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli -MANN). È da rilevare l'assenza di iniziative da parte delle istituzioni che si trovano nelle regioni dell'Abruzzo, del Molise e della Basilicata. Contenuto degli #hashtag e dei tweet. Dal punto di vista dei contenuti di #hashtag e tweet, è importante precisare che i dati, sia per il primo che per il secondo dataset, sono stati raccolti senza alcuna distinzione sulla lingua utilizzata per il testo del tweet. Una prima analisi, quindi, ha investigato quali lingue sono state maggiormente utilizzate come valore assoluto rispetto a tutti i tweet presi in esame e in relazione ai singoli #hashtag . Ovviamente, trattandosi di 21 iniziative promosse da istituzioni italiane, rivolte principalmente ad un pubblico locale, veicolate attraverso aggregatori in lingua italiana, l'italiano risulta la lingua con un numero maggiore di tweet (Annex - Figura 12 ) . Altre lingue utilizzate risultano l'inglese, seguite dalle lingue francese, catalano, rumeno e spagnolo. In Figura 13 è riportato il numero di tweet in relazione agli #hashtag specifici e le lingue d'uso per ognuno di questi: si nota una maggioranza dell'uso della lingua italiana per tutti e sei gli #hashtag, con una sensibile presenza delle etichette #emptymuseum e #ArTyouReady nei tweet creati da utenti anglofoni. La partecipazione da parte di utenti non italofoni ai contenuti aggregati da questi due #hashtag può essere motivata dal fatto che gli aggregatori sono in lingua inglese, caratteristica che aumenta la possibilità di accesso di un pubblico più ampio e variegato e la conseguente maggiore diffusione degli #hashtag stessi e dei loro contenuti. Inoltre, il numero di tweet non in lingua italiana prodotti utilizzando tali etichette può essere considerato indice della risonanza sovranazionale che hanno avuto le iniziative ad esse collegate. In minore concentrazione, seppur presente, la lingua inglese si registra anche nell'uso degli altri #hashtag propriamente italiani: #museitaliani , #museichiusimuseiaperti , #laculturaincasa , #laculturanonsiferma . Un altro livello di analisi ha riguardato il lessico utilizzato nella creazione degli #hashtag stessi. Per investigare gli aspetti lessicali delle etichette è stato preso in considerazione tutto il set di 33 #hashtag selezionati inizialmente, indipendentemente dal numero di interazioni che hanno catalizzato. Tra questi è possibile notare che le parole scelte per comporre l'#hashtag stesso sono riconducibili a quattro macro-gruppi semantici che fanno riferimento a: i) l'evento a cui sono associate, cioè la quarantena; ii) il luogo di fruizione mutato, cioè non più il museo ma la propria abitazione; iii) il contenuto veicolato, ovvero la cultura; iv) l'iniziativa proposta, come un quiz o una sfida. Al primo gruppo sono ascrivibili # quarantinelife , # betweenartandquarantine , # cultureinquarantine , che, come si può vedere, sono costruiti sul concetto e in relazione alla condizione di quarantena. In particolare # cultureinquarantine , che nel periodo di riferimento è stato il più cliccato, nasce da un'iniziativa promossa dal canale BBC con l'obiettivo di portare nelle case dei fruitori ogni forma d'arte, da quella dei musei a quella del teatro . 22 L'idea di un quasi ""delivery"" dell'arte è espressa anche dagli #hashtag appartenenti al secondo e al terzo gruppo. Nel secondo gruppo rientrano le etichette che includono un riferimento al luogo di fruizione tradizionale dei contenuti culturali, ovvero il museo, mutato nella sua collocazione geografica, confinato all'interno delle mura domestiche ma che assolve ugualmente alle sue funzioni. Del resto, l'obiettivo del Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Aquileia, che ha lanciato l'iniziativa # ilMUSEOaCASA , da cui poi gli #hashtag # ilmuseoacasa e # ilmuseoacasatua , è stato proprio quello di fare in modo che gli utenti potessero continuare a interagire con i contenuti museali, attraverso una serie di video e attività, suddivisi in tredici episodi pubblicati settimanalmente, rivolte soprattutto ai bambini . 23 Nel terzo gruppo, ugualmente si fa riferimento al mutato luogo di fruizione, ma in questo caso si punta sui contenuti che vengono fruiti in tali luoghi e sul concetto astratto di cultura. Infatti, se l'immagine di un museo a casa può sembrare ingombrante o associabile a quella di ""casa museo"", che è ben altra cosa, è più facile comprendere l'idea della # culturaincasa , come quella che è stata pensata dal Sistema Museale di Roma Capitale, denominato ""Musei in Comune"" (MIC), che con questo #hashtag propongono, tra le tante iniziative, un tour virtuale in cinque siti archeologici ( Musei capitolini, Museo Ara pacis, Museo dei Fori imperiali, Museo Napoleonico, Museo di Villa Torlonia) , e moltissime attività indirizzate a bambini e ragazzi, sponsorizzate 24 con l'#hashtag # laculturaincasaKIDS . Nell'ultimo gruppo rientrano quegli aggregatori che vogliono proporre iniziative di vario genere e il cui riferimento principale è appunto alle attività proposte/comunicate: da quelle ludiche, come # museumgames e # museumquiz , a cui si è accennato nella sezione precedente, rivolti a un pubblico ampio e variegato, non solo a quello di giovane età, fino a quelle propriamente riflessive, significanti, cioè, di campagne rivolte a sostegno del settore culturale e dei suoi attori gravemente colpiti dal lockdown, dal punto di vista economico. Tra questi rientra # ShareOurHeritage , lanciato dall'UNESCO il 10 aprile 2020, a cui ha fatto seguito il tenace # ResiliArt annunciato con un comunicato stampa il 28 aprile 2020 . 25 Per quanto riguarda l'estensione del testo dei tweet cui gli #hashtag sono stati associati, la Tabella 5 riporta la lunghezza media dei tweet per ognuno dei sei #hashtag considerati. Tale media è stata ottenuta conteggiando i caratteri, in ottemperanza alle norme di Twitter che permette di formulare testi brevi sulla base di un limite massimo di caratteri e non di parole. È da notare che in media si è fatto ricorso a tutto il numero di caratteri disponibili per i tweet, tranne per gli #hashtag # emptymuseum e # ArTyouReady che sono ben al di sotto di questa media. Questa differenza è spiegabile sulla base del tipo di iniziative che sono state proposte attraverso questi #hashtag che erano principalmente mirate a richiedere la condivisione di immagini da parte degli utenti; i tweet corredati dal primo #hashtag richiedevano, infatti, la partecipazione del pubblico con le loro foto dei luoghi di cultura senza utenti, quindi, appunto, vuoti, e senza la necessità di inserire un testo descrittivo. Il contenuto testuale dei tweet è stato analizzato in base alla frequenza dei termini utilizzati nel testo in associazione agli #hashtag selezionati. Per ognuno di questi è stata creata una nuvola rappresentativa del contenuto sulla base del numero di occorrenze delle parole ( Figura 14 ) . Rispetto a questi dati, possiamo notare la presenza per tutti i tweet di altri #hashtag di accompagnamento a quello di riferimento. Tali etichette aggiuntive sono di diverso tipo: in alcuni casi si fa riferimento ad #hashtag più generali riferiti alla pandemia (e.g., litaliachiamo nei 26 tweet relativi a # museichiusimuseiaperti e coronavirus , la cui presenza si nota anche in altre nuvole, nei tweet aggregati da # museitaliani ), in altri il riferimento è ai beni e alle istituzioni culturali più generali (e.g., mibact presente sia nella forma di #hashtag che di tag dell'utente _ mibact nei tweet legati ad # artyouready ed # emptymuseum ). Altri fenomeni interessanti che possono essere osservati in Figura 14 riguardano la presenza di termini che fanno riferimento ai contenuti ed eventi veicolati e aggregati, come nel caso di # laculturaincasa in cui compaiono video , concerto, teatro .@story_separate@In questo report sono stati presentati i risultati iniziali di una indagine sull'uso e la diffusione degli #hashtag da parte delle istituzioni culturali italiane, durante la Fase 1, quella con restrizioni maggiori alla mobilità dei cittadini, del periodo di lockdown dovuto all'epidemia di COVID-19 nel 2020. L'analisi quantitativa ha mostrato dei dati interessanti in termini sia di comunicazione dalle istituzioni verso il pubblico sia delle risposte e dell'interazione degli utenti. Il fenomeno del moltiplicarsi di #hashtag e tweet, a corredo delle numerose iniziative intraprese in risposta all'evento pandemico, è indicativo della velocità e della proattività con cui le istituzioni, in particolare i musei, hanno reagito. Tale atteggiamento da parte delle istituzioni culturali, come emerge anche dalla prima indagine NEMO, condotta dopo tre settimane dall'inizio del periodo di lockdown, ha contribuito a ridurre lo stato di isolamento e solitudine aumentando i servizi digitali per incoraggiare le persone a rispettare la politica di restrizioni. Inoltre, queste iniziative hanno stimolato un senso di fiducia e comunità attraverso le richieste rivolte agli utenti per la condivisione di oggetti, storie e immagini al fine di creare una memoria collettiva di tale periodo. Infine, le istituzioni hanno dimostrato di poter sostenere il ruolo di educatori informali pure operando a distanza attraverso la proposta di quiz, giochi e materiali educativi fruibili online. Dal canto loro, gli utenti hanno risposto in maniera positiva a tali iniziative, incrementando drasticamente il numero di interazioni su e con le istituzioni e dimostrando uno spiccato interesse ad una partecipazione attiva nella creazione e trasmissione di contenuti culturali. Gli #hashtag, scelti come caso di studio per questa analisi, hanno permesso di ricostruire gran parte delle iniziative che le istituzioni hanno lanciato a livello mondiale e nazionale; di monitorarne il successo nel corso dei mesi di marzo, aprile e per i primi giorni di maggio; di individuare tra gli utenti che hanno risposto all'invito a partecipare le istituzioni più attive sui social network e, infine, di essere classificati per aree tematiche a seconda della loro morfologia. Ulteriori linee di indagine si prospettano a partire dalla prima analisi esplorativa, in particolare per quanto riguarda la possibilità di analisi linguistiche volte a stabilire il tipo di contenuti veicolati e l'atteggiamento degli utenti, in termini di sentiment e sensitivity ai beni culturali, rispetto alle iniziative e alle informazioni fornite dalle istituzioni in questo periodo. Figura 1 -Andamento del numero di interazioni associati agli #hashtag per l'intero periodo di lockdown 29 Nasce contemporaneamente all' #hashtag #ArTyouReady. 30 La data di lancio, che è al di fuori del periodo di lockdown che è stato preso in considerazione in questo report, si spiega con la decisione della regione Lombardia di chiudere musei, biblioteche e altri luoghi pubblici di aggregazione, in anticipo rispetto al resto d'Italia, per contenere la diffusione del virus che ha colpito quella zona prima di diffondersi in tutta la Penisola https://www.varesenoi.it/2020/02/23/leggi-notizia/argomenti/attualita-17/articolo/coronavirus-chiusure-sera li-per-bar-e-locali-ecco-lordinanza-completa-della-regione-lombardia.html 31 Sebbene la data di lancio preceda di un giorno la pubblicazione del DPCM 8 marzo che sancisce la chiusura dei musei, l'iniziativa rientra nel piano di comunicazione adottato da ICOM Italia a sostegno dei Musei al tempo del COVID-19 http://www.icom-italia.org/eventi/laculturanonsiferma/",This report presents an analysis of #hashtags used by Italian Cultural Heritage institutions to promote and communicate cultural content during the COVID-19 lock-down period in Italy. Several activities to support and engage users' have been proposed using social media. Most of these activities present one or more #hashtags which help to aggregate content and create a community on specific topics. Results show that on one side Italian institutions have been very proactive in adapting to the pandemic scenario and on the other side users' reacted very positively increasing their participation in the proposed activities.
"The cell division cycle 25 (Cdc25) protein family, firstly identified in yeasts as a mitotic inducer [1] , comprises three members (Cdc25A, B, and C) of dual-specificity protein phosphatases [2] . In mammalian cells, these proteins are involved in the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2 (Cdk1-2), through the dephosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues located in the ATP-binding loop (Tyr 15 and Thr 14 ). All three forms cooperate to regulate cell division in human cells [3] . Particularly, Cdc25A controls both early and late cell-cycle transitions (G1-S, S, and G2-M) by acting on CyclinE-Cdk2, CyclinA-Cdk2 and CyclinB-Cdk1, meanwhile Cdc25B and Cdc25C promote mitosis activating CyclinB-Cdk1 and CyclinA-Cdk2 ( Figure 1 ) [4] [5] [6] . Following DNA damage and environmental stresses, Cdc25 proteins are phosphorylated and inactivated by Checkpoint 1-2 (Chk1-2) and MAPKAPK-2 kinases, determining their export outside the nucleus, and consequent cell-cycle arrest [7, 8] . Considering their role in the activation of cyclin-Cdk complexes and, therefore, in cell-cycle progression, Cdc25s have become interesting targets in the activation of cyclin-Cdk complexes and, therefore, in cell-cycle progression, Cdc25s have become interesting targets in the search for anticancer drugs. In particular, due to the role of Cdc25s in the activation of cyclin-Cdk complexes downstream the G1 phase and involving cyclin A, cyclin M, and cyclin B, interference with Cdc25s activity could effectively block tumor cell proliferation. Indeed, although there are growth factordependent and nutrient-dependent checkpoints in the G1 phase, the vast majority of mutations that contribute to cell transformation involve genes regulating G1-progression. Those mutations make tumor cells autonomous from growth factor stimulation but, through the dysregulation of the cellular metabolism, also able to override nutritional sensing [9, 10] . Consequently, while in the absence of growth factor instructions and nutrients cells commonly arrest at the G1 phase and undergo apoptosis, tumor cells are able to overcome all G1-checkpoints and progress along the G1 phase. In particular, in cancer cells, two signaling pathways activate G1 progression. The first involves ras mutations that, in a growth factor independent way, activate MAP kinase pathways increasing cyclin D expression and G1 complexes (cyclin D-Cdk4 and cyclin D-Cdk6) activation. The second is the mTOR pathway, which is highly sensitive to the presence of the energy and nutrients needed for activation of cyclin E complexes [11] . The possibility of intervention downstream of G1 checkpoints, through the inhibition of cyclin E, A, and B partners, strengthens Cdc25 inhibition as an anticancer strategy. From a structural point of view, human Cdc25A, B, and C include 524, 560, and 473 amino acids, respectively [12] [13] [14] . All three proteins comprise two main regions: the N-terminal region, which is extremely variable and acts as a regulatory domain (as the site of phosphorylation and ubiquitination, or the sequencing of nuclear localization and exportation), and the Cterminal region, which is extremely homologous and contains the catalytic site [15, 16] . The catalytic domain includes the HCX5R motif, characteristic of tyrosine phosphatase and composed of a highly conserved histidine; a catalytic cysteine (namely Cys 430 , Cys 473 , and Cys 377 in Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C, respectively); five residues (X5), whose amide groups form hydrogen bonds with phosphate residues; and a conserved arginine, required for binding to a phosphorylated amino acid of the substrate [13, 14, [17] [18] [19] . shows that the active sites appear flat and shallow, in contrast to other phosphatases [20, 21] . However, a well-ordered C-terminal helix adjacent to the catalytic pocket in the structure of Cdc25B contributes to the formation of the so-called ""swimming pool"", an extended and deep protein-sequence occupied by a significant amount of water molecules. This region contains several key residues that, in collaboration with those present in the catalytic domain, participate in the stabilization of protein-inhibitor complexes ( Figure 2 , panel (b)) [15, 22] . complex (on the right); the promotion of mitosis by Cdc25A-B-C through the activation of the Cdk1/CycB complex (on the left). The analysis of the crystal structures of the catalytic domains of Cdc25A and Cdc25B (Figure 2 , panel (a) and (b); Protein Data Bank (PDB) id: 1C25 and 1QB0, respectively) shows that the active sites appear flat and shallow, in contrast to other phosphatases [20, 21] . However, a well-ordered C-terminal helix adjacent to the catalytic pocket in the structure of Cdc25B contributes to the formation of the so-called ""swimming pool"", an extended and deep protein-sequence occupied by a significant amount of water molecules. This region contains several key residues that, in collaboration with those present in the catalytic domain, participate in the stabilization of protein-inhibitor complexes ( Figure 2 , panel (b)) [15, 22] . [20] with the catalytic Cys430 in the HCX5R loop (Cdk representation) and the C/N terminal tails highlighted. (b) Surface view of the Cdc25B crystal structure (PDB id: 1QB0) [21] with the catalytic HCX5R loop, the water molecules of the ""swimming pool"" region (yellow dots), the Cterminal helix, and the N-terminal tail highlighted. On the right, special focus is given to several of the most important residues (thick tube representation) within the catalytic pocket and the ""swimming pool"" involved in the catalytic process and the interactions with ligands. As reported by Lavecchia et al. [23, 24] , several molecules have been developed as selective inhibitors of Cdc25s. The most studied classes are quinonoids, phosphate surrogates, and electrophilic entities [25] . In particular, NSC663284 and BN82685 ( Figure  3 ), belonging to the quinonoid class, showed a remarkable Cdc25 inhibition activity, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range [26, 27] . For many years, NSC663284 ( Figure 3 ) has been used as a lead compound for the design of new Cdc25 inhibitors, with investigations made into its mechanism of action [28, 29] . In 2017, Ge et al. identified by in silico analysis the ""swimming pool"" region as the potential binding site of NSC663284 in the Cdc25B phosphatase [30] . Moreover, Tao et al., in analyzing Cdc25s catalytic domains and pharmacophoric moieties [31] , reviewed more suitable molecules (imidazopyridine CHEQ-2 [32] , 1,2,4triazole XDW-1 [33] , sesquiterpene HB-21 [34] , naphthyl-phenylamine ( Figure 3 [20] with the catalytic Cys430 in the HCX 5 R loop (Cdk representation) and the C/N terminal tails highlighted.

As reported by Lavecchia et al. [23, 24] , several molecules have been developed as selective inhibitors of Cdc25s. The most studied classes are quinonoids, phosphate surrogates, and electrophilic entities [25] . In particular, NSC663284 and BN82685 (Figure 3 ), belonging to the quinonoid class, showed a remarkable Cdc25 inhibition activity, with IC 50 values in the nanomolar range [26, 27] . For many years, NSC663284 ( Figure 3 ) has been used as a lead compound for the design of new Cdc25 inhibitors, with investigations made into its mechanism of action [28, 29] . In 2017, Ge et al. identified by in silico analysis the ""swimming pool"" region as the potential binding site of NSC663284 in the Cdc25B phosphatase [30] . Moreover, Tao et al., in analyzing Cdc25s catalytic domains and pharmacophoric moieties [31] , reviewed more suitable molecules (imidazopyridine CHEQ-2 [32] , 1,2,4-triazole XDW-1 [33] , sesquiterpene HB-21 [34] , naphthyl-phenylamine ( Figure 3 , molecule 1) [35, 36] , chalcone ( Figure 3 , molecule 2) [37], 1,3-thiazolidin-4-ones ( Figure 3 , molecules 3 and 4) [38, 39] ), with interesting inhibitory activity on Cdc25 enzymes. Due to the important role of Cdc25 as a checkpoint component of the cell cycle, the deregulation of its proteins at transcriptional, translational, and post translational levels can cooperate with oncogenic transformation and the progression of disease [25] , especially in breast, ovarian, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, lung head, and neck cancer cells [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . Furthermore, the overexpression of Cdc25A and Cdc25B is frequently linked with poor clinical prognosis [15, 48] . For these reasons, Cdc25s can be considered attractive targets from the development of specific inhibitors for targeted therapeutic treatment [25, 49] .

Then, a set of molecules containing 117 various Cdc25s inhibitors with IC50 values lower than 10 μM was collected from BindingDB [51] (Supplementary material S1). The used ligand-based template of Cdc25 was based on molecular descriptors. The set of 117 structures was processed with MOLDESTO (the molecular descriptors tool, implemented in DRUDIT). The output matrix (structures versus molecular descriptors) was converted into a sequence (the template) of a pair of values for each molecular descriptor (Di) ( Figure  5 ): mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). Then, the database of structures including more than 10,000 small molecules was submitted to the biological target finder tool in DRUDIT in order to rank each structure with a DRUDIT Affinity Score (DAS) against the Cdc25 template, as reported in Figure 5 .

The DAS score is assigned as Σαn/n, thus it is in the range 0 ÷ 1 (low ÷ high affinity). Supplementary material S2 reports the full BIOTARGET matrix produced by DRUDIT and the ranking of the input structures against the Cdc25 template. The application of the 0.8 cutoffs to DAS reduced the database to 106 molecules (Supplementary material S3). In order to select the best structures for biological assay, further analysis by means of a new in silico protocol was conducted ( Figure 4 ). This approach was based on the correlation between the antiproliferative activity values (expressed as GI50s) of the input structures and the expression patterns of target proteins against the full NCI60 cancer cell lines panel. The rationale behind this approach is the assumption that if the antiproliferative activity of a molecule is well linked with the protein expression pattern (high antiproliferative effect in a cancer cell line with a high expression of target protein/s and vice versa), it is very likely that its antiproliferative activity is due to the modulation of the target. This could be pursued thanks to the use of another NCI database that stores the expression patterns (EPs) of thousands of molecular targets from 60 different human tumor cell lines [52] . In the following, we denote the i-nth cell line with χ i . Therefore, a set of protein expression pattern data of Cdc25s against χ i was downloaded from the NCI database. Then, 26 experiments reporting the measures of the expression pattern (EP) for each Cdc25 form against χ i (10 for Cdc25A, 6 for Cdc25B, and 10 for Cdc25C, Supplementary material S4) were selected, obtaining the molecular target expression pattern values (Pi) and their mean value μP ( Figure 6 ). The deviation of each Pi from the μP normalized against the highest absolute value was computed to obtain the NEPi for each of the Cdc25 forms. Since the experimental GI50 values for the selected structures were not measured, we used the antiproliferative predictor tool in DRUDIT, to predict the GI50 values against χ i for the input structures by means of molecular descriptors (Supplementary material S5). Each of the 106 selected input structures was processed as follows. The mean value μG of the predicted GI50 values Gi against χ i was computed. Then, the deviation of each Gi from μG was calculated and normalized against the highest absolute value in order to obtain NGI50i ( Figure 6 , Supplementary material S4 and S5). Then, the database of structures including more than 10,000 small molecules was submitted to the biological target finder tool in DRUDIT in order to rank each structure with a DRUDIT Affinity Score (DAS) against the Cdc25 template, as reported in Figure 5 . The protocol assigns the α n binary score to each molecular descriptor (Di). This value is 1 when the molecular descriptor (Di) is in the range µ(Di) ± σ(Di), and 0 otherwise ( Figure 5 ). The DAS score is assigned as Σα n /n, thus it is in the range 0 ÷ 1 (low ÷ high affinity). Supplementary Material S2 reports the full BIOTARGET matrix produced by DRUDIT and the ranking of the input structures against the Cdc25 template.

In order to select the best structures for biological assay, further analysis by means of a new in silico protocol was conducted ( Figure 4 ). This approach was based on the correlation between the antiproliferative activity values (expressed as GI 50 s) of the input structures and the expression patterns of target proteins against the full NCI60 cancer cell lines panel.

Then, 26 experiments reporting the measures of the expression pattern (EP) for each Cdc25 form against χ i (10 for Cdc25A, 6 for Cdc25B, and 10 for Cdc25C, Supplementary Material S4) were selected, obtaining the molecular target expression pattern values (P i ) and their mean value µ P ( Figure 6 ). The deviation of each P i from the µ P normalized against the highest absolute value was computed to obtain the NEP i for each of the Cdc25 forms. Since the experimental GI 50 values for the selected structures were not measured, we used the antiproliferative predictor tool in DRUDIT, to predict the GI 50 values against χ i for the input structures by means of molecular descriptors (Supplementary Material S5). Each of the 106 selected input structures was processed as follows. The mean value µ G of the predicted GI 50 values G i against χ i was computed. Then, the deviation of each G i from µ G was calculated and normalized against the highest absolute value in order to obtain NGI 50i (Figure 6 , Supplementary Material S4 and S5). Then, the differences, δ i =|NEP i -NGI 50i |, and the fitting score, Φ = Σδ i , were computed for each of the Cdc25 A, B, and C form structures. Finally, each structure was ranked based on the mean of the three ϕ values (Φ). The highest scoring structures were those that reported lower values of Φ, indicating the best correlation between protein expression pattern and sensitivity. Among the 106 structures, the first 24 were selected for structure-based study in the next in silico step ( Then, the differences, δi =|NEPi-NGI50i|, and the fitting score, Φ = Σδi, were computed for each of the Cdc25 A, B, and C form structures.

A range of possibilities for the binding site and binding mode of various structures into Cdc25s binding sites were reported in the literature, identifying two potential binding regions for the target inhibition: the ""swimming pool"" pocket and the substrate catalytic site ( Figure 2 ) [22, 53, 54] . Furthermore, the suggested binding modes are various and they are obtained by the use of different molecular docking programs. For these reasons, and in order to cover all the possibilities, the docking grid was extended to both the catalytic and the ""swimming pool"" zones. Then, the 24 top-scoring molecules ( Figure 7 ) were submitted to induced-fit study into the binding site of Cdc25B (see material and methods), whose crystal structure is available at the PDB as 1QB0 [21] . The induced-fit docking (IFD) results (Table 1 ) allowed for the selection of the top 50% of scored molecules for their investigation, as Cdc25s modulators, in wet screenings (bold in Table 1 ). Further analyses were performed on the selected hits considering a series of wellconsolidated parameters for the search of bioactive compounds, such as PAINS filters [55] ; Lipinski's rule [56] ; Veber rules [57] ; and Egan rules [58] . Thus, the 12 previously selected molecules were submitted to SwissADME web-tools (http://www.swissadme.ch accessed on 31 March 2021) [59] . The results reported in Table 2 show that, generally, the selected compounds match expectations with regards to their bioactivity. In particular, seven of the twelve structures have no violations, and only the Cpd 798827 presented two rule violations (PAINs and Veber). Finally, the molecular descriptors matrix of the selected compounds was merged with that of the known Cdc25 inhibitors used to build the template, and multivariate analysis was performed. From this analysis emerged the method behind which the protocol was able to select molecules that are structurally different from those used in the building of the template. In fact, by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to the matrix (Supplementary Material S7) , the visual inspection on the PCA 2D representation (Figure 8 ) allows for the identification of a central region where the selected structures are clustered, while the template structures are spread in the left or right area, in approximatively two clusters. Finally, the molecular descriptors matrix of the selected compounds was merged with that of the known Cdc25 inhibitors used to build the template, and multivariate analysis was performed. From this analysis emerged the method behind which the protocol was able to select molecules that are structurally different from those used in the building of the template. In fact, by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to the matrix (Supplementary material, S7) , the visual inspection on the PCA 2D representation ( Figure  8 ) allows for the identification of a central region where the selected structures are clustered, while the template structures are spread in the left or right area, in approximatively two clusters. These results suggested that the ligand-based step of the protocol was able to select molecules endowing various scaffolds, in a different manner from that of the classical ligand-based methods. The selected compounds, whose structures and purity consistency were checked by HMRS analysis (Supporting Information S8), were tested in a dose-response assay on Cdc25 phosphatases. Eight of the twelve tested compounds (798827, B8063, E7887, F5312, J3955, M6690, O0288000, and PZ0240) inhibited in vitro the recombinant human Cdc25s phosphatases in a concentration-dependent manner. Concerning Cdc25A, the recorded IC 50 values ranged from 1.12 ± 0.09 to 19.88 ± 2.07 µM (Table 3 and Supplementary Material S9). A similar pattern of inhibition was observed on Cdc25B and Cdc25C, even though a lower inhibition activity was displayed. The determined IC 50 values for the most active compounds (E7887 and J3955) were comparable to the IC 50 of the menadione, a Cdc25 quinonoid inhibitor used as a positive control in this study. On the contrary, the compounds E7263, G5918, PZ0191, and SML0701 did not reduce the activity of the phosphatase in the tested concentration range (0.25-25 µM). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the Cdc25 inhibition activity of the tested compounds has been assayed. On the other hand, among the tested compounds, phosphatase inhibition activity is documented only for the clinically approved anticancer agent PZ0240 ((S)-crizotinib), which, in addition to its effect as a kinase inhibitor, is a stereospecific inhibitor of 2-hydroxy-dATP diphosphatase1 or MutT homolog 1 (MHT1) phosphatase [60] , an enzyme required for the survival of cancer cells and involved in DNA repair processes to maintain genome stability under oxidative stress [61, 62] . To assess Cdc25 inhibitors in cells, the antiproliferative activity of the most promising compounds (798827, B8063, E7887, F5312, J3955, M6690, O0288000, and PZ0240) was evaluated on the HepG2 tumor cell line for 48 h via MTT-based cell viability assay. Three of the tested compounds (E7887, J3955, and PZ0240) showed concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity with GI 50 in the low micromolar range (Table 4) . On the contrary, the other molecules showed low or no activity in the tested concentration range. Moreover, among the inactive molecules, only for B8063 (BML-210), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, the antiproliferative activity was previously reported on leukemic and cervical cancer cells [63, 64] . No data on the antiproliferative activity of E7887 (quinestrol), a synthetic estrogen used to treat postmenopausal syndrome and as a contraceptive component [65] , had been reported in the literature prior to this study. Instead, the antiproliferative activity of J3955, a high-affinity and selective opioid receptor-like 1 (ORL1) receptor antagonist, was recently explored and its effects on osteosarcoma and hepatocarcinoma cells were demonstrated [66, 67] . However, while we recorded a GI 50 value of 1.50 ± 0.37 µM on HepG2 cells, the data available in the literature showed antiproliferative activity at much higher concentrations. In particular, Zhao B. and Hu T. found antiproliferative effects on HepG2 cells at concentrations above 20 µM [67] . The reason for this discrepancy is probably due to the dissimilar cancer cell lines used for the analysis, with genetic and mutational profiles that are not completely superimposable. In their studies, Zhao B. and Hu T. employed a type of HepG2 cells characterized by deep invasive properties. In our assays, we used poorly invasive cells with phenotypic requirements generally described in the literature for the HepG2 line. The low invasiveness of hepatocarcinoma cells is justified by a high expression of epithelial cadherins and by a lack of expression of mesenchymal cadherins [68] . The biological results suggested an interesting correlation between the antiproliferative effect on HepG2 cell lines and the inhibition properties of Cdc25 enzymes. In particular, compounds E7887 and J3955, characterized by the highest Cdc25 modulation activities (Table 3) showed notable cellular growth inhibition with GI 50 values of 13.03 ± 0.85 and 1.50 ± 0.37 µM, respectively (Table 4) . The antiproliferative data, observed for the PZ0240 compound (GI 50 values 7.35 ± 0.77 µM), are in line with its anticancer therapeutic use as tyrosine kinase and an MTH1 inhibitor. The observed Cdc25s inhibition activities do not exclude multi-target effects. Based on the results described above, among all the tested molecules compound J3955 was identified as the one with the best inhibition effect on the Cdc25 phosphatase and with the highest antiproliferative activity. With the aim to further elucidate the mechanism of action of J3955 as a Cdc25 inhibitor, we performed flow cytometric analysis on HepG2 cells. Since the Cdc25s enzymes control the cell cycle through the dephosphorylation of their natural substrate Cdks, the inhibition of Cdc25s results in the hyperphosphorylation of Cdks with consequent cell-cycle arrest. Therefore, the impact of cell exposure to J3955 on cell-cycle progress and the phosphorylation state of Cdks was investigated. The flow cytometric analysis, for cell-cycle perturbation experiments, was executed in order to detect the shifts in cell-cycle distribution before a significant number of cells underwent apoptosis. The working concentrations of the compound J3955 were fixed at 1× and 2× of its GI 50 value used in the cell proliferation assay at 48 h. The histograms in Figure 9 represent the percentage of cells in respective cell-cycle phases (G1, S, and G2/M), along with the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 (dead cells) obtained by flow cytometry after either a 12 h (Figure 9 , panel A) or a 24 h (Figure 9, panel B) treatment. In the absence of J3955, HepG2 cells showed a normal diploid distribution with fast proliferation characteristics, with S + G2/M phase cells accounting for about 45% of the total cells. A 12 h treatment with J3955 arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 9A ). An increase in G2/M phase cells from 24% to 27% and from 24% to 36% (p < 0.0001) was observed as a result of cell exposure to J3955 at 1 × GI 50 (1.5 µM) and at 2 × GI 50 (3.0 µM), respectively. The cell accumulation in the G2/M cell-cycle phase was coupled to a decrease in the G0/G1 phase cells rather than a decrease in the S phase. A similar trend was observed after 24 h treatments with J3955 at 1 × GI 50 (1.5 µM): G2/M phase cells increase from 25% to 32% (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 9B ). However, when the cells were exposed to J3955 at 2 × GI 50 for 24 h, a new sub-G0/G1 population appeared, indicative of apoptotic cells, with a parallel decrease of the population in the G2/M phase ( Figure 9B ). Dephosphorylated Cdc25s are activated by both Cdk1 and Cdk2. Then, Cdc25s activate both the G1/S transition and S-phase Cdk-cyclin complexes (Cdk2-cyclinE and Cdk2/cyclinA), but also the Cdk1/cyclin B complex involved in the G2/M transition. Consequently, although Cdc25 inhibition induces cell-cycle arrest, the stage of cell-cycle block by Cdc25 inhibitors cannot be predicted and literature data show that it is cell line-dependent. obtained by flow cytometry after either a 12 h (Figure 9, panel A) or a 24 h (Figure 9 , panel B) treatment. In the absence of J3955, HepG2 cells showed a normal diploid distribution with fast proliferation characteristics, with S + G2/M phase cells accounting for about 45% of the total cells. A 12 h treatment with J3955 arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 9A ). An increase in G2/M phase cells from 24% to 27% and from 24% to 36% (p < 0.0001) was observed as a result of cell exposure to J3955 at 1 × GI50 (1.5 μM) and at 2 × GI50 (3.0 μM), respectively. The cell accumulation in the G2/M cellcycle phase was coupled to a decrease in the G0/G1 phase cells rather than a decrease in the S phase. A similar trend was observed after 24 h treatments with J3955 at 1 × GI50 (1.5 μM): G2/M phase cells increase from 25% to 32% (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 9B ). However, when the cells were exposed to J3955 at 2 × GI50 for 24 h, a new sub-G0/G1 population appeared, indicative of apoptotic cells, with a parallel decrease of the population in the G2/M phase ( Figure 9B ). Dephosphorylated Cdc25s are activated by both Cdk1 and Cdk2. Then, Cdc25s activate both the G1/S transition and S-phase Cdk-cyclin complexes (Cdk2-cyclinE and Cdk2/cyclinA), but also the Cdk1/cyclin B complex involved in the G2/M transition. Consequently, although Cdc25 inhibition induces cell-cycle arrest, the stage of cell-cycle block by Cdc25 inhibitors cannot be predicted and literature data show that it is cell line-dependent. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t-test to determine the differences between the datasets. * Denotes significant differences (p < 0.0001) from untreated cells (control).

Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t-test to determine the differences between the datasets. * Denotes significant differences (p < 0.0001) from untreated cells (control). In the same cell line, it is observed that several molecules displaying Cdc25 inhibition effects trigger different cell-cycle arrests. For example, Kabakci et al., studying the inhibition effect of various naphthoquinone compounds on Cdc25s, observed different cell-cycle arrests in HeLa cells (G1/S or G2/M arrest) [69] and an imidazopyridine Cdc25 inhibitor triggered S-phase arrest in MCF-7, HepG2, and HT-29 cell lines [32] . On the other hand, it has been observed that two structurally unrelated Cdc25 inhibitors arrested melanoma cell lines in the G2/M cell-cycle phase and activated an apoptotic program [35, 36, 70] . In addition, in previously published works some terpenoid compounds were tested on A375.S2 human melanoma cell lines. The authors described a different stopping phase of the cell cycle via Cdc25, strictly dependent on the effect of the tested triterpenoid compound [71, 72] . Endogenous Cdc25s control cell cycle progression through dephosphorylation via the activation of their natural substrate Cdks. Thus, to directly assess Cdk1 activity in HepG2 cells we used antibodies recognizing phosphorylated Thr14 or Tyr15, two amino acid residues selectively dephosphorylated by Cdc25 in the Cdk1 catalytic domain [69] . In order to investigate the involvement of the inhibition of Cdc25s in the antiproliferative action of J3955, the phosphorylation status of Cdk1 was analyzed after cell exposure to J3955. Western blot analysis of the lysate from HepG2 cells treated with J3955 at 0.75 µM, 1.5 µM, and 3 µM for 6 h showed a significant dose-dependent accumulation of the phosphorylated form of Cdk1, when compared to control cell lysates ( Figure 10 ). Considering that an increase in the phosphorylated protein fraction results in a decrease in the nonphosphorylated and active protein fraction, with the amount of total protein being almost unchanged along the different treatments, our results indicate that J3955 may impair Cdk1 activity in exposed cells and suggests its specific influence in molecular mechanisms involving Cdc25 proteins. tested triterpenoid compound [71, 72] .

After the treatment, cells were collected and the proteins were isolated for Western blot analysis as described in ''Materials and methods''. The panel shows a representative Western blot and densitometric analysis. The values represent the ratio between phospho-Cdk1 and total Cdk1, both previously normalized for the corresponding β-actin. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments with similar results. Different lowercase letters on the top of each histogram indicate statistical (p < 0.05) differences among the tested samples, as measured by one-way ANOVA followed by the Tuckey test. The letter ""a"" marks the highest value. Bars not sharing the same letter were significantly different. Figure 10 .

Hardware: the DRUDIT WEB service runs on four servers that are automatically selected according to the number of jobs and online availability. Each server can support up to ten simultaneous jobs, while the exceeding jobs are placed in a queue. Software: DRUDIT consists of several software modules implemented in C and JAVA running on MacOS Mojave. DRUDIT is based on molecular descriptors and represents the evolution of previous automated and online available tools [73, 74] . The molecular descriptor tool (MOLDESTO) that we implemented in DRUDIT is a new tool currently able to deal with more than 1400 molecular descriptors. MOLDESTO is able to read common molecules file formats, such as SMILES, SDF, Inchi, Mdl, and Mol2, to optimize structures, and is provided with a caching system to boost the calculation speed of previously submitted structures. Input structures can be drawn in the web application or uploaded to the server as external files. In either case, structures are optimized by MOPAC before being processed by MOLDESTO. The binding database (Bdb) [51] focuses on Ki, Kd, IC 50 , and EC 50 values, related to a well-defined protein target [75, 76] . The database of purchasable molecules submitted to in silico screening contains 10,715 structures, retrieved from the Sigma-Aldrich repository. The IFD (induced-fit docking) was applied by means of the Schrödinger software suite [77] [78] [79] [80] by using the settings from previous works [81, 82] . Cdc25B atomic coordinates were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB id, 1QB0) and refined by the Protein Preparation Wizard module to apply default parameters [83] . The IFD score, which accounts for both the protein-ligand interaction energy and the total energy of the system, is calculated weighing 95% of Glide Gscore and 5% of Prime Energy. It is used to rank the IFD poses considering that the more negative the IFD score, the more favorable the binding [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] . The inhibitory activity of the selected compounds for Cdc25s was assessed using the CycLex protein phosphatase Cdc25A, -B, and -C fluorometric assay Kit (CycLex, Cat. No. CY-1355) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The assay is based on the competition of the test compound for O-methyl-fluorescein phosphate (OMFP), an exclusive fluorescence Cdc25 substrate. An assay mixture containing OMFP was freshly prepared following the kit instructions. Test compounds were previously dissolved in DMSO to obtain stock solutions at 20 mM and kept at −20 • C. Working solutions of each compound were freshly prepared in the assay buffer. In each well, 40 µL of assay mixture was mixed with 5 µL of the test compound. The reaction was initiated by adding 5 µL (0.1 µg/µL) of the purified recombinant Cdc25 (Cdc25A, -B, and -C) proteins and mixing thoroughly. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Then, 25 µL of stop solution was added. Phosphatase activity was measured in a 96-well microtiter plate using a Cdc25s substrate. Fluorescence intensity (FI) was measured using a GloMax ® -Multi Microplate Reader equipped with a GloMax ® -Multi Fluorescence Module (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 580 nm. The background was defined as the FI generated from the wells that did not contain Cdc25s but were incubated with the assay mixture. The percentage enzyme activity of the test sample with respect to the control (OMFP wells) was calculated using the following equation: IC 50 was defined as the concentration of the compound at which there was 50% FI of the OMFP wells. The cancer cell line HepG2 (hepatocarcinoma cells) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, MD, USA). The cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 IU/mL penicillin, and 50 µg/mL streptomycin, and maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 at 37 • C. Cells were routinely cultured in 75 cm 2 culture flasks and were trypsinized using trypsin-EDTA. Exponentially growing cells were used for experiments. The selected derivatives were submitted to the MTT assay to assess the growth inhibition activity against HepG2 cells. The MTT assay is a measurement of cell metabolic activity, quite effective in estimating cell proliferation, that is based on the protocol first described by Mosmann [89] . The assay was performed as previously described [90] . Briefly, the cells were seeded into a series of standard 96-well plates in 100 µL of complete culture medium at 1.5 × 10 4 cells/cm 2 . Cells were incubated for 24 h under 5% CO 2 at 37 • C and the medium was then replaced with 100 µL of fresh medium supplemented by 5% (v/v) FBS containing the treatments. The stock solutions (20 mM) were prepared by dissolving selected compounds in DMSO. Working solutions were freshly prepared on the day of testing by diluting the stock solutions in the complete culture medium. For the experiment, we used a concentration range from 20 to 0.02 µM. Twenty-four hours after seeding, aliquots of 100 µL of different solutions at the appropriate concentrations were added to the appropriate wells and the cells were incubated for 48 h without the renewal of the medium. In each experiment, the DMSO concentration never exceeded 0.25% and a culture medium with 0.25% DMSO was used as control. After the incubation time, cells were washed and 50 µL FBS-free medium containing 0.5 mg/mL of MTT was added. The medium was discarded after a 3 h incubation at 37 • C and formazan blue formed in the cells was dissolved in DMSO. The absorbance (OD, optical density) at 570 nm of the MTT-formazan was measured in a microplate reader. As the absorbance is directly proportional to the number of living, metabolically active cells, the percentage of growth (PG) with respect to the untreated cell control for each drug concentration was calculated according to one of the following two equations: where: ODtzero is the average of the optical density measurements before the exposure of cells to the test compound; ODtest is the average of the optical density measurements after the desired period of time; and ODctr is the average of the optical density measurements after the desired period of time with no exposure of the cells to the test compound. The concentration necessary for 50% of growth inhibition (GI 50 ) for each derivative was calculated from concentration−response curve using linear regression analysis, by fitting the test concentrations that give PG values above and below the reference value (50%). Each result was the mean value of three separate experiments performed in quadruplicate. Finally, in order to exclude potential cytotoxic effects at the concentration range used for our experiments, the Trypan blue exclusion method was employed. DNA staining with propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry analysis were applied as previously described with the aim to evaluate the effects of the selected derivatives on cell-cycle progression [91] . Briefly, HepG2 cells were seeded on 12-well plates at a density of 2.0 × 10 4 cells/cm 2 , and treated 24 h after seeding without or with the indicated concentrations of the test compound for 12 or 24 h. Following the treatments, cells were collected, washed in PBS, and stained with staining solution (20 µg/mL propidium iodide, 200 µg/mL RNAse A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min at 37 • C. The DNA contents of more than 10,000 cells were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Coulter Epics XLTM, Beckman, Brea, CA, USA), and the percentage of cells belonging to the different compartments of the cell cycle was determined. All experiments were performed in duplicate and reproduced at least two times. The phosphorylation status of the Cdk1 was analyzed by Western blotting, as previously reported [92] . Briefly, HepG2 cells were treated with J3955 (1.5, 3, and 6 µM) for 6 h and after treatment cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested by scraping in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Hepes, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1.5 lg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor, 7 lg/mL pepstatin A, 5 lg/mL leupeptin, 0.1 mM benzamidine, and 0.5 mM dithioerythritol (DTT)) and incubated for 15 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000× g for 5 min, and supernatants were immediately portioned and stored at −80 • C. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Aliquots of cell extracts containing 5-15 µg protein were separated on 8-12% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Colored molecular weight standards (Amersham) were run simultaneously. The immunoblot was incubated overnight at 4 • C with blocking solution (5% skim milk), followed by incubation with either an anti-Cdk1 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen, Cat: 33-1800), anti-phospho-Cdk1 (Thr14, Tyr15) policlonal antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA, Cat: 710840), or anti β-actin monoclonal antibody (Invitrogene, Cat: MA1-744) as control, for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed two times with Tween 20/Trisbuffered saline (TTBS) and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), or with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Dako) for 1 h at room temperature. All data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Three independent observations were made for each experiment. Statistical difference was calculated using an unpaired Student's t-test. Tukey was used to examine the difference between group means. The data presented in this study are available on Supplementary Materials. The authors declare no conflict of interest.@story_separate@The correlation between protein expression pattern and chemosensitivity revealed an innovative and alternative method in the identification of new modulators for the selected targets. Differently from the traditional in silico methods, the proposed protocol allows for the selection of molecular structures with heterogeneous scaffolds, which are not strictly related to the binding sites and with chemical-physical features that can be more suitable for all the pathways involved in the overall mechanism. In this work, we focus our attention on Cdc25 enzymes as crucial targets to halt tumor proliferation. The new mixed ligand structure-based approach permitted, from the evaluation of a database containing more than 10,000 small molecules, the identification of 12 compounds as potential inhibitors of Cdc25s. The biological screenings of the selected structures consolidated and confirmed the in silico results. In particular, the enzymatic inhibition assays showed interesting Cdc25s IC 50 values for most of the tested molecules. Among them, J3955, the most active inhibitor of Cdc25s, exhibited antiproliferative activity against HepG2 cells, with GI 50 values in the low micromolar range. The flow cytometric analysis, for cell-cycle perturbation experiments, highlighted, after treatment with J3955, cell-cycle arrest and the accumulation of the phosphorylated form of Cdk1. To gain further insight into the structure-based results, the binding modes of the most interesting compounds were analyzed. The best example, observed by the IFD study (J3955, Figure 11a ,b), shows several interactions at the junction between the catalytic pocket and the ""swimming pool"". In particular, the flat aromatic quinoline scaffold of J3955 is accommodated in the surface of the shallow active site, whereas the flexible and hydrophobic phenylethyl moiety is able to penetrate deeply into the adjacent ""pool"", where it encounters several apolar residues (Met483, Leu443, Pro444, Leu445, Cys426, and Tyr428). The amidic portion forms several H-bonds with Glu478 (in the catalytic HCX5R motif) and Arg544 (C-terminus, in the ""swimming pool"") side chains. Similarly, but with completely different structural features, compound E7887 also could inhibit Cdc25 by binding both to the catalytic cleft (partially occupied by the cyclopentyl ring) and to the ""swimming pool"", in which the hydrophobic steroid scaffold is inserted (Figure 11c,d) . Inside this cavity, 17β-OH stabilized the complex by forming H-bonds with the side COOH and the backbone NH of Glu446. The lack of reactive groups could permit a reversible binding, avoiding the wellestablished toxicity of the quinonoid agents and electrophilic entities.

Institutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable. Informed Consent Statement: Not applicable.","The cell division cycle 25 (Cdc25) protein family plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation, making it an excellent target for cancer therapy. In this work, a set of small molecules were identified as Cdc25 modulators by applying a mixed ligand-structure-based approach and taking advantage of the correlation between the chemosensitivity of selected structures and the protein expression pattern of the proposed target. In the first step of the in silico protocol, a set of molecules acting as Cdc25 inhibitors were identified through a new ligand-based protocol and the evaluation of a large database of molecular structures. Subsequently, induced-fit docking (IFD) studies allowed us to further reduce the number of compounds biologically screened. In vitro antiproliferative and enzymatic inhibition assays on the selected compounds led to the identification of new structurally heterogeneous inhibitors of Cdc25 proteins. Among them, J3955, the most active inhibitor, showed concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity against HepG2 cells, with GI(50) in the low micromolar range. When J3955 was tested in cell-cycle perturbation experiments, it caused mitotic failure by G2/M-phase cell-cycle arrest. Finally, Western blotting analysis showed an increment of phosphorylated Cdk1 levels in cells exposed to J3955, indicating its specific influence in cellular pathways involving Cdc25 proteins."
